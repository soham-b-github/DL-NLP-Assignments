I owe everything to George Bailey...
Help him, dear Father.
Joseph, Jesus and Mary.
Help my friend, Mr. Bailey.
Help my son, George, tonight.
He never thinks about himself, God, that's why he's in trouble.
George is a good guy.
Give him a break, God...
I love him, dear Lord.
Watch over him tonight...
Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy...
Please bring Daddy back.
Hello, Joseph.
Trouble?
Looks like we'll have to send someone down.
A lot of people asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
George Bailey. Yes.
Tonight's his crucial night.
You're right.
We'll have to send someone down immediately.
Whose turn is it?
That's why I came to see you, sir.
It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Oh, Clarence.
Hasn't got his wings yet, has he?
We've passed him up right along.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child. Simple.
Joseph, send for Clarence.
You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Clarence.
A man down on earth needs our help.
Splendid!
Is he sick? No.
Worse.
He's discouraged.
At exactly ten forty-five P.M., earth-time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Oh, dear, dear!
His life!
Then I have only an hour to dress.
What are they wearing now?
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey. Sir...
If I should accomplish this mission...
I mean, uh, might I perhaps win my wings?
I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir... and people are beginniing to talk.
What's that book you've got there?
Oh, 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey and you'll get your wings.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Poor George. Sit down.
Sit down?
! What are we...
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
- Well, naturally, of course, I...
- Well, keep your eyes open.
- See the town?
- Where?
I...
I don't see a thing.
Oh, I forgot.
You haven't got your wings yet.
Now look, I'll help you out.
Concentrate.
Begin to see something?
Why, yes!
This is amazing!
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
Oh, wonderful!
Yippee!
Okay, boys, let's go.
Hey, who's that?
- That's your problem, George Bailey.
- A boy? !
That's him when he was twelve.
Back in nineteen nineteen.
Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
Come on, Marty.
Come on, Marty.
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw!
And here comes the scare-baby, my kid brother, Harry Bailey!
I'm not scared!
Go, Harry!
C'mon, Harry!
Attaboy, Harry!
Come on, Harry!
Help, George!
Help!
Help!
...Harry, I'm coming!
- Help!
- Hang on, Harry!
I'm coming!
Chain Gang!
George saved his brother's life that day.
But it caught him that cold which infected his left ear.
Cost him his hearing in that ear.
It was weeks before he was able to go back to his after-school job at old man Gower's Drugstore.
Mr. Potter!
Who's that?
A king?
That's Henry F. Potter.
The richest and meanest man in the county.
Hee-haw!
Hee-haw!
Go to work, slave...
I wish I had a million dollars!
Hot dog!
It's me, Mr. Gower.
George Bailey.
- You're late
- Yes, sir.
Hello, George.
Hello, Mary.
Hello, Violet.
Two-cents' worth of shoelaces?
She was here first.
I'm still thinking.
Shoelaces?
Please, Georgie.
I like him.
You like every boy.
What's wrong with that?
Here you are.
- Help me down.
- Help you down? !
Made up your mind yet?
I'll take chocolate.
With coconuts?
I don't like coconuts.
You don't like coconuts?
Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from?
Look it here...
from Tahiti, Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!
A new magazine!
I never saw it before.
Of course you never.
Only us explorers can get it.
I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Is this the ear you can't hear on?
George Bailey, I'll love you till the day I die.
I'm going out exploring some day, you watch.
And I'm gonna have a couple of harems, and maybe three or four wives.
Wait and see.
- George!
George!
- Yes, sir.
You're not paid to be a canary.
No, sir...
Mr. Gower, do you want something?
- Anything?
- No.
- Anything I can do back here?
- Nope.
I'll get them, sir.
...take those capsules over to Mrs. Blaine's.
- She's waiting for them.
- Yes, sir...
They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Ummm.
Is it a charge, sir?
Yes, charge.
- Mr. Gower, I think...
- Aw, get going!
Yes, sir.
Fast there, Captain Cook!
Where you headin'?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
- Some other time, George.
- It's important!
There's a squall in there that's shaping' up into a storm.
Uncle Billy, telephone.
- Who is it?
- The Bank examiner.
Bank examiner?
Oh, I should have called him yesterday.
Switch it inside.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Well, you're begging and that's a whole lot worse.
All I'm asking for is thirty days more.
- Pop! - Just a minute, son.
Just thirty short days.
I'll dig up that five thousand somehow.
- Shove me up. Shove me up.
- Pop!
Have you put any real pressure on these people of yours to pay those mortgages?
Times are bad, Mr. Potter.
A lot of these people are out of work.
- Then foreclose!
- I can't do that.
- These families have children.
- Pop! They're not my children.
But they're somebody's children, Mr. Potter.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
- Well, all right...
- Not with my money.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character?
You have no family, no children.
You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
He's not a failure!
- You can't say that about my father!
- George, George, quiet.
George, George...
You're not! You're the biggest man in town!
- Run along.
- Bigger than him.
- Run along! - Bigger than everybody!
Gives you an idea of the Baileys.
Don't let him say things like that about you, Pop.
All right, son.
All right.
Thanks. I'll talk to you tonight.
What!
Why, that medicine should have been there an hour ago.
It'll be over in five minutes, Mrs. Blaine.
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?
I feel...
- Didn't you hear what I said?
- Yes, sir, I...
What kind of tricks are you playing anyway?
Why didn't you deliver them right away?
Don't you know that boy's very sick?
You're hurting my sore ear.
You lazy loafer!
Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're doing.
You put something wrong in those capsules.
I know you're unhappy.
You got that telegram and you're upset.
You put something bad in those capsules.
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.
Just look and see what you did.
Look at the bottle you took the powder from.
It's poison!
I tell you it's poison!
I know you feel bad.
I didn't know...
- Oh... - Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Oh, no, no, no... Oh, George. George...
Oh, Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone.
I know what you're feeling.
I won't tell a soul.
- Hope to die, I won't.
- Oh, George, George...
An overnight bag, genuine English cowhide, combination lock, fitted up with brushes, combs...
Nope! Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
Now look, Joe.
Now look,
I, I-I want a big one.
What did you stop it for?
I want you to take a good look at that face.
- Who is it?
- George Bailey.
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist?
That's the kid.
Uh-huh.
It's a good face.
I like it.
I like George Bailey.
Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
Not a soul.
Did he ever marry the girl?
Did he ever go exploring?
Well, wait and see.
Big...see... I, I don't want one for one night.
I want something for a thousand and one nights.
With plenty of room here for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand... a great big one.
- I see, a flying carpet, huh?
- Yeah. I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
Now you're talking.
Gee whiz, I could use that as a raft in case the boat sunk.
- How much does this cost?
- No charge.
That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
That's right.
Well, what's my name doing on it here?
A little present form old man Gower.
Came down and picked it out himself.
He did?
!
What do you know about that...
my old boss.
Isn't that nice? What boat you sailing on?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
- A cattle boat?
- Okay, I like cows.
- Hello, Mr. Gower.
- George! How are you?
Thanks ever so much for the baggage.
- It's just exactly what I wanted.
- Aw, forget it. Oh, it's wonderful of you to think of it.
- Hope you enjoy it.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.
I wish I had a million dollars.
Hot dog!
Avast there, Captain Cook! You got your sealegs yet?
Parlez vous Francais, Mister?
Hey, send us some of their picture postcards, will you, George?
Hey, George, don't take any plugged nickels.
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.
Hey, Ernie!
Hi, Ernie!
- Hiya, George.
- Hi, Bert.
- George... - Hey, hey, I, I'm a rich tourist today.
- How about driving me home in style?
- Great. Hop in Your Highness, hop in. And for the carriage trade.
I put on my hat.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
- Hello, Violet.
Hey, you look good.
That's some dress you got on there.
What! This old thing?
Why, I only wear it when I don't care how I look.
- How would you like...
Want to come along, Bert?
We'll show you the town.
No, thanks.
I, uh, I've gotta go home and see what the wife's doing.
Family man.
George!
Harry! You're shaking the house down!
Stop it!
Oh, let them alone! I wish I was up there with them.
But Harry'll tear his dinner suit!
George! That's why all children should be girls.
But if they were all girls, there wouldn't be any...
Oh, never mind.
George!
Harry! Come down to dinner this minute.
Everything's getting cold and you know, how long we've been waiting for you.
Okay, Mom!
- Here's a present for you, Pop.
- Oh, you two idiots!
- George, sit down and have dinner.
- I've eaten. Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduating party?
- Look at you!
- I don't care.
It's George's tux. Annie, my sweet, have you got those pies?
If you lay a hand on me, I'll hit you with this broom.
Annie, I'm in love with you, there's a moon out tonight.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, my last meal in the old Bailey Boarding House.
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure!
Pop, can I have the car? I have to take over a lot of plates and things.
- What plates?
- Oh, Mom, I'm Chairman of the Eats Committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
Oh, no, you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.
Hope you have a good trip, George.
Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.
I'll miss you too, Pop.
What's the matter?
You look tired. - Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
- Oh. I thought when we put him on the board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
Oh, what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
Oh, he's a sick man.
Frustrated and sick. And his mind's sick in his soul, if he has one.
He hates everybody that has anything that he can't have.
He hates us mostly, I guess.
Gangway! Gangway!
So long, Pop.
So long! - Harry, you got a match?
- Very funny.
Very funny. Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs ready for you.
- Now, hurry up, hurry up.
- Okay, Mom.
- You coming later?
- Don't you drop one of those.
- You coming later, George?
- What do you mean,
- and be bored to death?
- Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor tonight, too.
- Oh, I hope it works.
- No gin tonight, son!
- Aw, Pop, just a little. - No, son.
Not one drop.
Oh! Boys and girls and music...
why do they need gin?
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
You know, George, I wish we could send Harry to college with you.
Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Mmm, we have that all figured out.
Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, and work there four years, then he'll go.
- He's pretty young for that job.
- Well, no younger than I was. Maybe you were born older, George.
How's that?
I say, you were born older.
I suppose you've decided what you want to do when you get out of college.
Oh well, you know what I've always talked about...build things... design new buildings...
plan modern cities...
- all that stuff, I was talking about. - Still after that first million before you're thirty.
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
'Course it's just a hope, but uh, you wouldn't consider coming back to the Building and Loan, would you?
Well, I...
I... Why, Annie, why, why don't you draw up a chair?
Then you'd be more comfortable and you could hear everything that's going on.
I would if I thought I'd hear anything worth listening to.
You would, eh?
- I know it's soon to talk about it.
- Oh, now, Pop.
I, I,
I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office...
Oh, I'm sorry, Pop, I didn't mean it that way, but this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe...
I'd go crazy. I... I wanna do something big and something important.
You know, George, I feel that in a small way we are doing something important.
Satisfying a fundamental urge.
It's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace.
And we're helping him get those things in our shabby little office.
I know, Pop.
I, uh, I, I know that I, I...
I wish I felt... but I, I've been hoarding pennies like a miser here in order to...
Most of my friends have already finished college.
I, uh, I just feel like if I didn't get away, I'd bust.
Yes, yes.
You're right, son.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter.
And you've got talent, son.
I've seen it. You get yourself an education.
Pop, you want a shock?
I think you're a great guy.
Oh, did you hear that, Annie?
I heard it. About time one of you lunkheads said it.
I'm going to miss old Annie.
Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Here you are.
George! Hello!
You know my kid brother, George?
I'm going to put him through college. - Hello, George!
- Hee-haw!
Oh, oh, Sam Wainwright.
How are you? When did you get here?
Oh, this afternoon.
I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Old college graduate now, huh? Yeah. Old Joe College Wainwright, they call me.
Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
- Yep.
- Hey, hey! Harry!
You're the guy I want to see.
- The Coach has heard all about you.
- He has? Yeah.
He's followed every game and his mouth's watering.
He wants me to find out if you're going to come along with us.
Well, I eh, I gotta make some dough first.
Well, you'd better make it fast.
We need great ends like you. not broken-down old guys like this one!
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw!
George!
Welcome back!
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?
Putting a pool under this floor was a great idea.
Saved us another building.
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.
There's lots of stuff here to eat and drink. - Lots of pretty girls around.
- Hey, George...
- Hello, Violet.
How are you...
- Hello.
What am I bid?
- George... - Marty.
Well, it's old home week.
Marty!
Glad to see you.
- Do me a favor, will you, George?
- What's that?
- Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. "Mamma wants you, Marty." "Mama wants you." Remember?
Dance with her, will you?
Oh, me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
- Aw, go on. - Hey, sis!
And don't be long, Marty!
I don't want to be a wet nurse for... And the next thing I knew, some guy came up and tripped me. That's the reason why I came in fourth.
- They know what kind of a guy I am... - You remember George?
- This is Mary.
Well, I'll be seeing you.
- Well...well...well...
Now, to get back to my story, see...
Hey, this is my dance.
Oh, why don't you stop annoying people?
Well, I'm sorry.
- Well, hello.
- Hello. - You look at me as if you didn't know me.
- Well, I don't. You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Me? !
Uh-huh.Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch.
That wasn't you.
O-yes, o-yes, o-yes! The big Charleston contest!
The prize?
A genuine loving cup! Those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor.
- I'm not very good at this.
- Neither am I.
Hey, you're wonderful!
What's the matter, Othello, jealous?
Did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor?
And did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up?
And did you further know that George Bailey is dancing right over that crack?
Stand back, everybody!
They're cheering us.
Get out!
Buffalo Gals, can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?
Buffalo Gals, can't you come out tonight?
And dance by the light of the moon.
- Oh, Hot dog!
Just like an organ.
- Beautiful.
I told Harry I thought I'd be bored to death.
You, you should have seen the commotion in that locker room. I, I had to knock off three people to get this stuff we're wearing here.
Here, let me, let me hold that old wet dress of yours.
Do I look as funny as you do?
I guess I'm not quite the football type.
I...
You, you look wonderful! You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Well, why don't you say it?
Well, I don't know. Maybe I will say it.
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen?
!
Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Too young or too old?
Oh, no, no. Just right.
Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
I, I mean, without a dress.
You look older.
I, I mean, younger.
You look...
y-y-you just look...
- Oh, oh!
- Oh, oh!
- Oh, no. I wanna...
- Sir, my train, please!
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.
Your...your caboose, me lady.
- You may kiss my hand.
Hey, Mary.
As I was lumbering down the street, down the street, down the street...
Okay then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Oh, no, don't!
I-I love that old house.
You see, you make a wish and then try and break some glass.
And you got to be a pretty good shot nowadays, too.
Oh, no, George, don't.
It's full of romance, that old place.
I'd like to live in it.
- In that place? ! - Uh-huh.
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch.
- What did you wish, George?
- Well, not just one wish.
A whole hatful.
Mary, I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that.
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm gonna see the world.
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon...
the Colesseum.
Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know and then I'm going to build things.
I'm gonna build air fields.
I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high.
I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.
Hey, that's pretty good.
Buffalo Gals, Can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?
Buffalo Gal, Can't you come out tonight?
And dance by the light of the moon.
What'd you wish when you threw that rock?
- Oh, no. - Come on, tell me.
If I told you, it might not come true.
What is it you want, Mary?
What do you want?
You, you want the moon? ! Just say the word and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down.
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.
- I'll give you the moon, Mary.
- I'll take it. Then what?
Well then, you could swallow it, and it'd all dissolve, see?
And the moon beams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes and the ends of your hair.
Am I talking too much?
Yes! Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?
How's that?
Want me to kiss her, huh? Aw, youth is wasted on the wrong people!
Hey, hey, hold on.
Hey, mister, come on back out here.
I'll show you some kissing that'll put hair back on your head.
Okay, I give up.
Where are you?
Over here, in the hydrangea bushes. Here you are.
Catch.
Wait a minute.
This is a very interesting situation!
- Please give me my robe.
- Hmm.
A man doesn't get in a situation like this every day.
I'd like to have my robe.
Not in Bedford Falls anyway.
- Ooooouch!
Oh!
- Gesundheit.
- George Bailey! - This requires a little thought here.
Give me my robe!
I've read about things like this, but I never...
Shame on you!
I'm going to tell your mother on you!
Oh, my mother's way up on the corner over there.
I'll call the police! They're way downtown.
They'd be on my side, too.
Then, then, then I'm going to scream!
Maybe I could sell tickets.
Let's see. No, no, the point is, in order to get this robe...
I've got it.
I'll make a deal with you, Mary.
George!
Come on home.
Quick.
You father's had a stroke!
What?
!
Mary! Mary, I'm sorry.
I've got to go.
Come on, George.
Let's hurry! - Did you get a doctor?
I think that's all we'll need you for, George, I know you're anxious to make a train.
I have a taxi waiting downstairs.
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months.
Good luck to you at school, George.
- Thanks.
- Good luck! So long!
Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting... to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to get to my real purpose.
- Wait just a minute now.
- Wait for what?
I claim this institution is not necessary to this town.
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver.
Potter, you dirty, contemptible...
I'll wring his neck, so help me, George,
- you hear what that buzzard...
- Mr. Chairman, it's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to talk about chloroforming the Building and Loan.
Peter Bailey died three months ago.
I second Mr. Potter's motion.
Very well.
In that case, I'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw.
But before you go,
I'm sure the whole Board wishes to express its deep sorrow
- at the passing of Peter Bailey.
- Thank you very much.
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
I'll go further than that.
I'll say that to the public, Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.
Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from you, considering that you probably drove him to his grave.
Peter Bailey was not a business man.
That's what killed him.
Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul.
He was a man of high ideals, so-called. But ideals without common sense can ruin this town.
Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop... you know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi, you know.
I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he comes here and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars.
- Why?
- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.
You have all the papers there. His salary, insurance.
I can personally vouch for his character.
- A friend of yours. - Yes, sir.
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money.
What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class.
And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas.
- Now, I say...
- Just a minute.
Just a...
Just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.
You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that.
Why he ever started this cheap penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know.
But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was...
Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself.
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?
He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me.
But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.
And what's wrong with that?
Why...here, you are all businessmen here.
Doesn't it make them better citizens?
Doesn't it make them better customers?
You...you said that uh... what'd you say just a minute ago...
They, they had to wait and save their money before they even thought of a decent home.
Wait! Wait for what?
Until their children grow up and leave them?
Until they're so old and broken-down that they...
Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars?
Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about... they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community.
Well, it is too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?
Anyway, my father didn't think so.
People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle.
Well, in my book, he died a much richer man than you'll ever be.
I'm not interested in your book.
I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
I know very well what you're talking about.
You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you.
That's what you're talking about, I know.
Well, I, I, I've said too much.
I... You're, you're the Board here.
You do what you want with this thing.
There's j-just one thing more though.
This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter.
Sentimental hogwash.
I want my motion.
Oh boy, that was telling him, George, old boy.
You shut his big mouth.
You should have heard him. What happened? We heard a lot of yelling.
Well, we're being voted out of business after twenty-five years.
Easy come, easy go.
Here it is. "Help wanted - Female."
You still want me hang around, George?
Yeah, I'll be right down. Hey, you'll miss your train.
You're a week late for school already.
Go on. - What's going on in there?
- Oh, never mind. Don't worry about that.
They're putting us out of business.
I can get another job.
I'm only fifty-five.
- Fifty-six. - Go on, go on.
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip, now you don't want to miss college, too, do you?
George! George!
They want to keep it going.
- Whoopee! - You did it, George, you did it.
But they got one condition, only one condition.
- What's that? - That's the best part of it.
They've appointed George here as Executive Secretary to take his father's place.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...
You can keep him on. That's all right.
As Secretary you can hire anyone you like.
Dr. Campbell, now let's get this thing straight.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving right now. I'm going to school.
This is my last chance. Uncle Billy here, he's your man.
I know, I know, he didn't go.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother, Harry, and sent him to college.
Harry became a football star.
Made second team All-American.
Yeah, but what happened to George?
George got four years older, waiting for Harry to come back and take over the Building and Loan.
Oh, there are plenty of jobs around for somebody that likes to travel.
Look at this. There...
Venezuela oil fields - Wanted.
Man with construction experience.
Here's the Yukon, oh, right here - wanted - man with engineering experience.
There she blows.
You know what the three most exciting sounds in the world are?
- Uh-huh. - Breakfast is served, lunch is served, dinner...
No, no, no, no!
- Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
- Peanut?
There's the Professor now.
- Old Professor Phil Beta Kappa Bailey! All-American.
- Well, if it isn't old George Geographic Explorer Bailey.
What? No husky dogs?
No sled? Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit.
- Nobody ever changes here, you know that.
- Oh, am I glad to see you.
- Say, where's mother?
- She's home, cooking the fatted calf.
- Come on. Let's go. - Oh, wait!
George, Uncle Billy, I want you to meet Ruth.
- Hello. - How do you do. - Ruth Dakin.
- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.
Huh?
Well, I wired you I had a surprise.
Here she is. Meet the wife.
Well, what do you know - wife.
Well, how do you do.
Congratulations.
What am I doing? Congratulations!
They're married...
why didn't you tell somebody?
...Oh, I can't wait to see Tilly's face.
- Did you really marry him? - Why, yes...
What's a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two-headed brother of mine?
Well, I tell you. It's purely mercenary. My father offered him a job.
Oh, he gets you and a job?
Well, Harry's cup runneth over.
Uh, George, about that job, Ruth spoke out of turn.
I never said I'd take it.
You've been holding the bag here for four years, and... well, I won't let you down, George.
I would like to...
I forgot the bags. I'll be right back.
It was a surprise to me.
This is the new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife. Old, old friends of the family.
- Oh, of course, I've heard him speak of you.
- And I want you to tell you, we're going to give the biggest party this town ever saw.
Here, have some popcorn.
George, George, George, that's all Harry ever talks about.
Uh, uh, uh, Ruth, uh, this, uh, what about this job?
Oh, well, my father owns a glass factory in Buffalo.
He wants to get Harry started in the research business.
- Well, is it a good job?
- Oh, yes, very.
- Not much money, but, uh, good future, you know.
- I know.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. I feel so good.
I could spit in Potter's eye.
I think I will.
I think I will.
What did you say? Huhh?
Oh, maybe I'd better go home.
Where's my hat? Where's my... Oh!
Oh, thank you, George, which is mine?
- The middle one. - Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy.
Now, look, if you'll point me in the right direction...would you do that, George?
- Right down here.
- Oh... Old Building and Loan pal, huh...
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down there.
That way, huh?
My Wild Irish rose...
I'm all right.
I'm all right. The sweetest flower that grows...
Hello, Mom.
That's for nothing.
- How do you like her?
- Oh, she's swell.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls anyway.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
- Uh-huh.
- Came back three days ago. Hmmm...
- Nice girl, Mary.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
- Hmmm...
- Oh, stop that grunting. Hmmm.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
- Sure
- Sam Wainwright.
- Hmmm?
- Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary.
- Well, she's not crazy about him.
Well, how do you know?
- Well, did she discuss it with you? - No.
- Well then, how do you know? - Well, I've got eyes, haven't I?
Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Oh...
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York and you're here in Bedford Falls.
And all's fair in love and war.
Mother of mine, I can see right through you, right to your back collar button...
- Uh-huh.
Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry.
All right, Mother, Old Building and Loan pal,
I think I'll go out and find the girl and do a little passionate necking.
Oh, George...
Now if you'll just point me in the right direction... this direction?
- Excuse me...
- Now, wait a minute.
I think I got a date.
But uh, stick around, fellows, just in case, huh?
We'll wait for you, baby.
- Hello, George-Porgie!
- What?
What gives?
- Nothing.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I'm...probably end up down at the library.
Georgie, don't you ever get tired of just reading about things?
- Yes.
What are you doing tonight?
- Not a thing.
Are you game, Violet?
Let's make a night of it. Oh, I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we do?
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes, and walk through the grass.
Huh?
It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can, uh, s-swim in it.
Then we can climb Mt.
Bedford, and smell the pines and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal...
Georgie, have you gone crazy?
Walk in the grass in my bare feet?
- Why, it's ten miles up to Mt.
Bedford. - Shhh...
What are you doing, picketing?
Hello, Mary.
I just happened to be passing by.
Yes, so I noticed.
- Have you made up your mind?
- How's that?
Have you made up your mind?
- About what? - About coming in.
Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
My mother just called you?
Well, how did she know? - Didn't you tell her? - I didn't tell anybody.
I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by, idiot.
What do you...
went for a walk. That's all.
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Well, I'll come in for a minute.
I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here, you know.
- When did you get back?
- Tuesday.
Where'd you get that dress?
I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Angie, and the rest of them.
Oh, oh, I worked there a couple of vacations.
But...
I don't know... I-I guess I was homesick.
Homesick?
For Bedford Falls?
Yes, and my family, and...
Oh, everything.
Would you like to sit down?
All right, for a minute.
I-I still can't understand it though.
You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
Would you rather leave?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles around here.
And dance by the...
What's the matter?
Oh, oh, yeah...yeah...
Well, I...
It was nice about your brother Harry, and Ruth, isn't it?
Oh...yeah, yeah. That's all right.
Well, of course, I like her. She's a peach.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
Uh, marriage is all right for Harry and Marty and Sam and you.
Mary! Mary!
Who's down there with you?
It's George Bailey, Mother.
George Bailey? !
What's he want?
I don't know. What do you want?
Me?
I-I just came in to get warm.
He's making violent love to me, Mother.
You tell him to go right back home, and don't you leave the house, either.
Sam Wainwright promised to call you from New York tonight.
But your mother needn't...
You know I
- I didn't come here to... What did you come here for then?
I don't know.
You tell me.
You're supposed to be the one that has all the answers.
- You tell me. - Why don't you go home?
That's where I'm going.
I don't know why I came here in the first place.
- Good night.
- Good night! Mary!
Mary!
- The telephone. It's Sam!
Hello.
I forgot my hat. Hee-haw!
Hello, Sam, how are you?
Aw, I'm great. Gee, it's good to hear your voice again.
Oh, well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam.
There's an old friend of yours here.
George Bailey. You mean old moss-back George?
Yes.
Old moss-back George.
Hee-haw!
Put him on. W-Wait just a minute.
I-I'll call him.
George!
He doesn't want to speak to George, you idiot!
He does so. He asked for him. Geo-George!
- Hi, Sam.
- Well, George Bailoffski!
Hey, a fine pal you are.
What're you trying to do?
Steal my girl? W-W-What do you mean?
Nobody's trying to steal anybody's girl.
H-Here...here's Mary.
No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I want to talk to both of you. - Here to you.
- Tell Mary to get on the extension.
- Mother's on the extension. We...
I am not!
We can both hear.
Come here. We-We're listening, Sam.
Well look, I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich.
George, you remember that night in Martini's Bar when, eh, you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Jelly beans? Shut up, will you?
Do you remember out of jelly- ...out of soybeans?
Huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah... soybeans.
Yeah. Well, listen.
Dad snapped up the idea.
How do you like that?
Rochester?
Well, why Rochester?
Well, why not?
Can you think of anything better?
Oh, I don't know... It's just...
Why not right here?
Y-You remember that... that old tool and machinery works?
W-Well, you tell your father he can get that for a song.
And all the labor he wants, too.
Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Is that so? Well, I'll tell him.
Hey, that sounds great.
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.
Now here's the point, Mary...
Now listen, have you got any money?
- Money? Yeah...well, a little. - Well now, listen.
I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear?
And George, I may have a job for you, that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan.
Well, this is the biggest thing since radio.
And I'm letting you in on the ground floor.
Oh, Mary...
Mary...
Well, I-I'm here.
Uh, would you tell that guy I'm giving him the chance of a lifetime, you hear?
H-He says it's the chance of a lifetime.
Now you listen to me.
I don't want any plastics. I don't want any ground floors.
And I don't want to get married ever to anyone.
You understand that?
I want to do what I want to do.
And you're...
and you're...
- Oh, Mary...
George... George...
Mary...
First Harry.
Now George.
You speak for yourself, Mrs. B.
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Hey, look!
There's somebody driving this cab.
Bert the cop sent this over.
He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
- Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!
- Good old Bert.
By the way, where are you two going on this here now honeymoon?
Where are we going?
Look at this.
There's the kitty, Ernie.
Here, come on, count it, Mary.
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.
Look! You know what we're going to do?
We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York.
A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels, the oldest champagne, the richest caviar, the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!
Wow! That does it! Then what?
- Then what, honey?
That does it, come here, come here, come here!
Don't look now, but there's something funny going on over there at the bank, George.
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money in the bank, you better hurry.
Let's go. - Just a minute, dear.
- Oh-oh...
Well, hello, everybody.
What is this, Uncle Billy?
A holiday?
George... Come on in, everybody.
Now look, why don't you all sit down? There are a lot of seats over there.
Just make yourself at home.
George, can I see you a minute?
- Why didn't you call me?
- I just did, but they said you left.
This is a pickle, George.
This is a pickle.
All right now, what happened?
How did it start?
Well, how does a thing like this ever start?
All I know is the bank called our loan.
- When? - About an hour ago.
- I had to hand over all our cash. - All of it?
Every cent of it and it still was less than we owe. Holy mackerel!
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors.
The whole town's gone crazy.
George, it's Potter.
there is a rumor around town that you've closed your doors.
Is that true?
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that.
George, are you all right?
- Do you need any police? - Police? What's for?
Well, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you know.
George, I'm going all out to help in this crisis.
I've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs.
They'll close up for a week and then reopen.
He just took over the bank.
I may lose a fortune, but I'm willing to guarantee your people too.
Just tell them to bring their shares over here, and I will pay fifty cents on the dollar.
Aw, you never miss a trick, do you, Potter? Well, you're gonna miss this one.
George, was it a nice wedding?
Yeah...
Now, just remember that this thing isn't as black as it appears.
I have some news for you folks.
I was just talking to old man Potter and he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank.
The bank's going to reopen next week.
But, George, I got my money here.
Did he guarantee this place?
Well, no, Charlie.
I didn't even ask him. - We don't need Potter over here.
- I'll take mine now.
No, but you...you...
you're thinking of this place all wrong.
As if I had the money back in a safe.
The, the money's not here.
Well, your money's in Joe's house... that's right next to yours.
And in the Kennedy House, and Mrs. Macklin's house, and, and a hundred others.
Why, you're lending them the money to build, and then, they're going to pay it back to you as best they can.
Now what are you going to do? Foreclose on them?
I got two hundred and forty-two dollars in here and two hundred and forty-two dollars isn't going to break anybody.
Okay, Tom. All right.
Here you are.
You sign this.
- You'll get your money in sixty days.
- Sixty days?
Well, now that's what you agreed to when you bought you shares.
- Tom... Tom... Did you get your money?
- No. Well, I did.
Old man Potter'll pay fifty cents on the dollar for every share you got.
- Fifty cents on the dollar!
- Yes, cash!
- Well, what do you say?
- Now, Tom, you have to stick to your original agreement.
- Now give us sixty days on this.
- Okay, Randall.
- Are you going to go to Potter's?
- Better get half than nothing. Tom!
Tom!
Randall, now wait a minute, wait... now listen...now listen to me.
I-I beg of you not to do this thing.
If Potter gets ahold of this Building and Loan, there'll never be another decent house built in this town.
He's already got charge of the bank.
He's got the bus line.
He's got the department stores. And now he's after us. Why?
Well, it's very simple.
Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why.
And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides.
Joe, you had one of those Potter houses, didn't you?
Well, have you forgotten? Have you forgotten what he charged for that broken-down shack?
Here, Ed.
You know, you remember last year when things weren't going so well, you couldn't make your payments.
You didn't lose your house, did you?
Do you think Potter would have let you keep it?
Ca-Can't you understand what's happening here?
Don't you see what's happening?
Potter isn't selling.
Potter's buying.
And why? Because we're panicky and he's not. That's why.
He's picking up some bargains.
Now, We-We can get through this thing all right.
We-We've got to stick together, though.
We've got to have faith in each other.
But my husband hasn't worked in over a year and I need money.
- How am I going to live until the bank opens?
- I got doctor bills to pay. - I need cash.
- I can't feed my kids on faith.
Hey!
I got two thousand dollars.
Here's two thousand dollars.
This'll tide us over until the bank reopens. All right, Tom, how much do you need?
Two hundred and forty-two dollars.
I'll take two hundred and forty-two dollars.
- There you are.
- That'll close my account.
Your account's still here.
That's a loan.
Okay. All right, Ed?
- I got three hundred dollars here, George.
- Alright, now, Ed... wh-wh-what'll it take till the bank opens?
What do you need?
- Well, I-I suppose twenty dollars.
- Twenty dollars.
Now you're talking.
Fine.
Thanks, Ed.
All right now, Mrs. Thompson, how much do you want?
- But it's your own money, George.
- Never mind about that.
- How much do you want?
- I can get along with twenty, all right.
- Twenty dollars. - And I'll sign a paper.
I know you-you'll pay it when you can. That's okay.
All right, Mrs. Davis?
- Could I have seventeen-fifty?
- Seven...
Bless your heart, of course you can have it. You got fifty cents?
- Seven... - We're going to make it, George.
- They'll never close us up today!
- Six, five, four, three, two, one...
Bingo!
Close the door, Ernie.
We made it. Look.
Look, we're still in business.
We're still got two bucks left. Well, look, let's have some of that.
Let's celebrate, huh. G-Get some glasses, Tilly.
Well, a couple of financial wizards.
Those Rockefellers.
Get a tray for these two great big important simoleans here.
We'll save them for seed. A toast. A toast!
A toast to Mama Dollar and to Papa Dollar, and if you want to keep this old Building and Loan in business,
- you better have a family real quick. - I wish they were rabbits. I wish they were, too.
- Folks, folks, wedding cigars!
- Oh-oh...wedding!
Holy mackerel, I'm married!
Where's Mary?
Mary... Well, poor Mary.
Look, I've got a train to catch. Well, the train's gone.
I wonder if Ernie's still here with his taxicab?
George, there's a call for you.
Look, will you get my wife on the phone?
She's probably over at her mother's.
- Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.
- I don't want Mrs. Bailey. I want my wife.
Mrs. Bailey!
Mrs...oh, that's my wife.
Here, I'll take it in here.
Mary! Hello.
Listen, dear. I'm sorry...
What?
Come home?
What home?
Three-twenty Sycamore? Well, what... whose home is that?
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
How would you like to get a ticket next week?
- Haven't you any romance in you? - Sure I have, but I got rid of it.
Liver pills!
Who wants to see liver pills on their honeymoon?
What we want is romantic places, beautiful places...places George wants to go.
- Hey, Bert.
Here he comes. - Come on, we got to get this up.
He's coming.
- Who?
What are they - ducks?
- Get that ladder up here.
Hiya... Geo...uh...good evening, sir.
Entree, Monsieur.
- Entree.
- Islands of Hawaii, Where skies of blue are calling me.
Where balmy air and golden moonlight caress The waving palms of Waikiki.
I Love You Truly,
Truly, Dear.
Life with Its Shadows,
Oh, Mary...
Life with Its Tears.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house?
Fade into Dreams, - This is what I wished for.
When I Feel You Are Near,
- Darling, you're wonderful.
I Love You Truly,
Truly, Dear.
- Martini, you rented a new house?
- Rent?
- You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey? - What's that?
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini, I own my own house.
No more we live like pigs in this Potter's Field.
Hurry, Marie!
Come on...
Bring the baby.
This is like a dream!
I'll take the kids in the car.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey.
Get in here.
Now get right up on the seat there.
Get the...get the dog!
You've got a goat too!
- All right.
- Goodbye, everybody!
Mr. and Mrs. Martini, welcome home.
Good old George.
He's always making a speech.
Hee-haw!
- Sam Wainwright!
- Oh, who cares!
Bread! That this house may never know hunger.
Salt! That life may always have flavor!
And wine!
That joy and prosperity may reign forever. Enter the Martini castle!
Look, Mr. Potter, it's no skin off my nose.
I'm just your little rent collector.
But you can't laugh off this Bailey Park anymore.
Look at it.
Congressman Black is here to see you.
Oh, tell the congressman to wait. Go on.
Fifteen years ago, a half-dozen houses stuck here and there.
There's the old cemetery, squirrels, buttercups, daisies.
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.
Look at it today. Dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw.
Ninety per cent owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you!
Your Potter's Field, my dear Mr. Employer, is becoming just that.
And are the local yokels making with those David and Goliath wisecracks.
Oh, they are, are they?
Even though they know the Baileys never made a dime out of it.
You know very well why, the Baileys were all chumps.
Every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the Building and Loan to build.
As I say, it's no skin off my nose.
But one of these days this bright young man is going to be asking George Bailey for a job.
The Bailey family has been a boil on my neck long enough.
- Yes, sir? - Come in here.
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then
- we're going to drive on down to Florida. - Oh...
- Why don't you have your friends join us? - Why, sure.
Hey, why don't you kids drive down with us, huh?
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam. Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh?
Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics and he turned me down cold.
- Oh, now don't rub it in.
- I'm not rubbing it in.
Well, I guess we better run along.
Awfully glad to have met you, Mary.
- Nice meeting you.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, George. - So long, George.
- See you in the funny papers.
- Goodbye, Sam.
- So long, Mary. - So long, Sam.
Thank you, sir.
Well, I, uh, I suppose I'll find out sooner or later, but just what exactly did you want to see me about?
George, now that's just what I like so much about you.
George, I'm an old man, and most people hate me.
But I don't like them, either, so that that makes it all even.
You know, just as well as I do, that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan.
You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it or kill it.
But I haven't been able to do it.
You have been stopping me.
In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing.
Take during the depression, for instance. You and I were the only ones that kept our heads.
You saved the Building and Loan, I saved all the rest.
Well, most people say you stole all the rest. The envious ones say that, George, the suckers.
Now, I have stated my side very frankly.
Now, let's look at your side.
Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, married, making say...forty a week.
- Forty-five!
- Forty-five. Forty-five.
Out of which, after supporting your mother and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say ten, if you skimp.
But, George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel.
He's an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man, who hates his job, who hates the Building and Loan, almost as much as I do.
A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born.
A young man...the smartest one of the crowd, mind you, a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places, because he's trapped.
Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters.
Do I paint a correct picture, or do I exaggerate? Oh, what's your point, Mr. Potter?
- My point? My point is, I want to hire you.
I want you to manage my affairs, run my properties.
George, I'll start you out at twenty thousand dollars a year.
nbsp; Twenty thous... twenty thousand dollars a year?
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe.
You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
Would I? Y-You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you?
you know, th-this is me, you remember me?
Oh, yes, George Bailey.
Whose ship has just come in, provided he has enough brains to climb aboard.
Well, how about the Building and Loan?
Are you afraid of success?
I'm offering you a three-year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today.
Is it a deal, or isn't it?
Well, Mr. Potter, I... I...
I know I ought to jump at the chance but I...
I just, uh,
I-I wonder if-if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
Sure, sure, sure.
You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
- Yeah. In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
- All right, sir. - Okay, George?
Okay, Mr. Potter.
I, I don't have to talk to anybody.
I know right now, and the answer is no!
No!
Doggone it!
You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money.
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.
In the...in the whole vast configuration of things,
I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider.
You...and that goes for you, too.
And it goes for you, too.
Buying your wife a lot of fine clothes. Going to New York on a business trip a couple of times a year.
Maybe to Europe once in a while.
I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the hear after that.
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet, and I'm going to see the world and then I'm going to build things.
I'm going to build air fields. I'm going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high.
I'm going to build a bridge a mile long.
What is it you want, Mary? What?
Y-You want the moon?
If you do, just say the word, I'll throw a lasso around it and pulls her down for you.
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight,
Won't you come out tonight, Won't you come out tonight.
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight,
And...
Mary Hatch!
Wh-Why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
To keep from being an old maid. You could have married Sam Wainwright and anybody else in town.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town.
I want my baby to look like you.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you...
your what?
My baby.
You... You-You-You-You-You-You-You...
Mary, you're on the nest?
George Bailey lassoes stork.
Lassoes the stork!
What do you...
You mean...you-you-you...
What-what-what is it, a boy or a girl? Uh-hm.
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
Mary had her baby, a boy. Then she had another one, a girl.
Day after day she worked away remaking the old Granville house into a home.
Night after night, George came back late from the office.
Potter was bearing down hard.
Then came a war.
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch joined the Red Cross and sewed.
Mary had two more babies but still found time to run the U.S.O.
Sam Wainwright made a fortune in plastic hoods for planes.
Potter became head of the draft board.
One-A...
one-A...one-A
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.
Bert the cop was wounded in North Africa, got the Silver Star.
Ernie, the taxi-driver, parachuted into France.
Marty helped capture the Remagen Bridge. Harry, Harry Bailey topped them all.
A Navy flier, he shot down fifteen planes.
Two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
- Yes, but George... - George?
Four-F on account of his ear, George fought the battle of Bedford Falls.
Hold on, hold on, hold on now.
Don't you know there's a war on?
Air raid warden... paper drives...scrap drives... rubber drives...
Like everybody else, on V-E day he wept and prayed.
On V-J day, he wept and prayed again.
Joseph, now show him what happened today. Yes, sir.
This morning, day before Christmas, about ten A.M., Bedford Falls Time.
Hi, Ernie, look at that.
Gonna snow again.
I know, I know, George. And it's marvelous.
Commander Harry Bailey!
Mr. Gower, look at this.
The second page.
Now look, this is for you.
This is for you. That's for you.
- Thanks. - See you again.
Be sure you spell the name right.
Hello, Billy, how are you?
- Harry! What do you know about that!
- He reversed the charges.
It's okay, isn't it?
Reverse the charges...
of course it's for a hero.
Harry...
Oh, you old seven times of a son of a gun.
Congratulations!
How's mother standing it?
She did? What do you know...
Mother had lunch with the President's wife.
Wait till Martha hears about this.
- What did they have to eat?
- Wha-What did they have to eat?
H-H-Harry, you should see what they're cooking up in the town for you.
Oh, they are?
The Navy's going to fly mother home this afternoon. In a plane? What?
Uncle Billy?
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
- No, he stopped at the bank first. No, he's not here right now, Harry.
But look...
- George... - ...tell me about it.
...George, tha-that man's here again.
- What man?
- B-B-Bank...examiner.
Oh, oh.
Uh, uh,
Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute, will you?
I'll be right back.
Well...
- Harry...
- Good morning, sir. Carter, bank examiner.
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
We're all excited around here.
My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor.
The president just decorated him.
Well, I guess they do those things.
Well, I trust you had a good year.
Good year?
Uh, well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Yeah, very funny.
Uh, w-well...
Now, come right in here, Mr. Carter. Oh, I shouldn't wonder when you okay reverse charges on personal long distance calls.
George, shall we hang up?
No, no. He wants to talk to Uncle Billy. You just hold on.
Now, if you'll cooperate, I'd like to finish with you by tonight.
I want to spend Christmas in Elmira with my family.
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter. Just step right in here.
We'll fix you up.
December twenty-fourth...
Eight thousand.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter... Well, good morning, Mr. Potter?
What's the news? Oh, well, well, well.
Harry Bailey wins Congressional Medal.
That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys?
You just can't keep those Baileys down, now can you, Mr. Potter.
How does slacker George feel about that?
Very jealous. Very jealous. He only lost three buttons off his vest.
Of course, slacker George would have gotten two of these medals if he had gone.
Bad ear.
Yes. After all, Potter, some people like George had to stay at home.
Not every heel was in Germany and Japan.
- I guess you forgot something.
- Huh? - You forgot something.
- Well, aren't you going to make a deposit? - Oh, sure, sure I am.
Well, then it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Huh?
Oh, shucks...
Well, I knew I had...
- How about that finger there?
- Hmm? Well, I... Bailey...
Come on, look sharp.
George, can I see you for a second?
Why, of course you can.
Come on in the office here.
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry. He's on the telephone.
Hurry, Uncle Billy, hurry.
Long distance, Washington.
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.
Harry, your nephew, remember? Here he is.
Hurry up.
Hello...hello.
Y-Y-Yes, Harry. Yes...everything...
everything's fine.
I should have my head examined.
Eight thousand dollars.
It's got to be somewhere.
It takes a lot of character to leave your home town and start all over again.
No, George, don't...
- Now here, now you're broke, aren't you? - I know, but...
What do you want to do, hock your furs and that hat?
Want to walk to New York?
You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
- Yeah, sure. - It's a loan.
That's my business.
Building and Loan.
Besides, you'll get a job.
Good luck to you.
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.
Hmm.
- Merry Christmas, Violet.
- Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry.
I'll be right with you. - Uncle Billy in?
- Yeah, he's in his office.
Unc...
What's going on?
The bank examiner's here, and I...
- He's here?
- Yeah, yeah.
He wants the accounts payable... - What's the matter with you?
- Come here.
Did you see Uncle Billy with any cash last night?
He had it on his desk counting it before he closed up.
Now look, did you buy anything?
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum. - All right, all right.
Now, we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
All right.
This way.
Yeah...maybe, maybe, maybe... Maybe-Maybe! I don't want any maybe.
We've got to find that money!
- I'm no good to you, George.
I... - Uncle Billy, do you...
Listen to me.
Do you have any secret place hiding place?
I can't think anymore, George. I can't think anymore.
It hurts...
Where's that money, you silly, stupid old fool?
Where's that money?
Do you realize what this means? It means bankruptcy and scandal, and prison!
That's what it means.
One of us is going to jail! Well, it's not gonna be me.
We're going to put...
Bless you!
Did you bring the wreath?
- Yes, Daddy, did you bring the Christmas wreath?
Oh, that's the Merry Christmas Wreath for the window.
No. I left it at the office.
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, just started.
- Where's your coat and hat?
- Left them at the office.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter. Everything's all right.
Way up at the top. That's it.
All right.
Fill in that little bare spot right there.
That's it.
Isn't it wonderful about Harry?
I'll bet I had fifty calls today about the parade, the banquet.
Your mother's so excited, she...
I have to practice it for the party tonight, Daddy. Mommy says we can stay up till midnight and sing Christmas carols.
Can you sing, Daddy?
Better hurry and shave.
The families will be here soon.
I... I don't want the families over here.
Come on out in the kitchen with me while I finish dinner.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Have a hectic day?
Oh, yeah.
Another big red-letter day for the Bailey's.
Daddy, the Brown's next door have a new car.
You should see it. Well, what's the matter with our car?
Isn't it good enough for you? Yes, Daddy.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse you for what?
I burped!
All right, darling, you're excused.
Now go upstairs and see what little Zuzu wants.
Zuzu.
W-What's the matter with Zuzu? Oh, she's got a cold.
Caught it coming home from school.
They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
- What is it, a sore throat or what? - Just a cold.
- The doctor says it's nothing serious. - The doctor? - Was the doctor here?
- Yes, I called him right away.
- He says it's nothing to worry about.
- Is she running a temperature?
- What is it?
- Just a teensy one, ninety-nine, six.
- She'll be all right.
- Gosh, it's this old house.
I don't... I don't know why we don't all have pneumonia.
This drafty old barn!
Might as well be living in a refrigerator.
Why did we have to live here in the first place and stay around this measly, crummy old town?
George, what's wrong? Wrong? Everything's wrong.
Why did we have to have all these kids?
Dad, how do you spell 'frankincense'?
I don't know. Why, ask your mother. - Where're you going?
- Going up to see Zuzu.
He told me to write a play for tomorrow.
Hi, Daddy. - Well, what happened to you?
- I won a flower.
W-Where do you think you're going?
Want to give my flower a drink.
All right, all right, here, give Daddy the flower.
I'll give it a drink.
All right, here.
- Look, Daddy...paste it.
- Yeah, all right...
Now, I'll paste this together.
Now, there it is, good as new.
All right, give the flower a drink. - Now, will you do something for me?
- What? Will you try to get some sleep?
I'm not sleepy.
I want to look at my flower.
I know, I know, but you just go to sleep and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
- It will? - Uh-huh.
Hello.
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey. Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch.
I'm sure she'll be all right.
The doctor says that she ought to be out of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner.
- Is that Zuzu's teacher?
- Yes. Let me speak to her. Hello.
Hello, Mrs. Welch?
This is George Bailey.
I'm Zuzu's father.
Say, what kind of a teacher are you anyway?
What do you mean sending her home like that, half naked?
Do you realize she'll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you?
- George! - Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for - to have teachers...
to have teachers like you?
Stupid, silly, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on?
You know, maybe my kids aren't the best-dressed kids, and maybe they don't have any decent clothes...
Aw, that stupid...
He-Hello, Mrs. Welch.
I-I-I want to apologize.
Hel-lo...hello...
- She's hung up.
- I-I-I'll hang her up.
Now, who do you think you are? What is that?
Hello?
Who is this? Oh, Mr. Welch?
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.
Gives me a chance to tell you what I really think of your wife.
- George...
- Will you get out and let me handle this? Hello?
Hello? What?
Oh, you will, huh?
Okay, Mr. Welch.
Any time you think you're man enough.
Hello...any...
Oh... Daddy, how do you spell "Hallelujah?"
How should I know?
What do you think I am, a dictionary? Tommy, stop that!
Stop it!
Janie, haven't you leaned that silly tune yet?
You've played it over and over again.
Now stop it!
Stop it!
Janie, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...
You go on and practice.
I'm sorry. What do you want to know?
Nothing, Daddy.
- Now, go on, play.
- Oh, Daddy...
Mary...
- Yes, Pete. - Shall I pray for him?
- Yes, Janie, pray very hard.
- Me, too?
- You, too, Tommy.
Hello, Uncle Billy?
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.
I need help.
Through some sort of an accident my company's short in their accounts.
The bank examiner's got there today. I've got to raise eight thousand dollars immediately.
Oh, so that's what the reporters wanted to talk to you about?
- The reporters?
- Yes, they called me up from your Building and Loan.
Oh, there's a man over there from the D.A.'s office, too.
He's looking for you. Please help me, Mr. Potter.
Help me, won't you, please?
Can't you see what it means to my family?
I'll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan, any interest if you still want the Building and Loan.
I'm... George, could it possibly be there's a slight discrepancy in the books?
No, sir.
There's nothing wrong with the books. I've just misplaced eight thousand dollars.
I can't find it anywhere.
You misplaced eight thousand dollars?
Yes, sir. Have you notified the police?
Harry's homecoming tomorrow...
They're gonna believe that one.
What've you been doing, George?
Playing the market with the company's money?
No, sir, no, sir. I haven't.
What is it, a woman then?
You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
- What! - Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me?
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
I can't get ahold of him.
He's in Europe. Well, what about all your other friends?
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter.
You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
I see.
I've suddenly become quite important.
Wha-What kind of security would I have, George?
- Have you got any stocks? - No, sir. Bonds?
Real estate? Collateral of any kind?
I have some life insurance, a fifteen thousand dollar policy.
Yes...how much is your equity in it? - Five hundred dollars.
- Five hundred dollars!
And you ask me to lend you eight thousand.
Look at you. You used to be so cocky!
You were going to go out and conquer the world.
You once called me a warped, frustrated old man.
What are you but a warped frustrated young man?
A miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help.
No securities, no stocks, no bonds, nothing but a miserable little five hundred dollar equity in a life insurance policy.
You're worth more dead than alive.
Why don't you go to the riff-raff you love so much ask them to let you have eight thousand?
You know why? Because they'd run you out of town on a rail.
But I tell you what I'm going to do for you, George.
Since the state examiner is still here, as a stock holder of the Building and Loan,
I'm going to swear out a warrant for your arrest.
Misappropriation of funds, manipulation, malfeasance...
All right, George, go ahead, George.
You can't hide in a little town like this.
Bill? This is Potter.
- Glad you come.
- Thank you. - How about some of that good spaghetti?
- We got everything.
Oh, God...
I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there, and you can hear me, show me the way.
I'm at the end of my rope.
I... Show me the way, God.
Why you drink so much, my friend?
Please go home, Mr. Bailey. This is Christmas Eve.
Bailey?
Which Bailey?
This is Mr. George Bailey.
She cried for an hour.
It isn't enough she slaves teaching your stupid kids how to read and write, and you have to bawl her out,eh.
You get out of here, Mr. Welch!
Now wait. I want to pay for my drink. Never mind the money.
You get out of here quick.
- All right.
- You hit my best friend.
Get out!
He gone. No worry.
His name is Welch.
He no come in to my place no more.
Oh, Welch.
That's what I get for praying.
The last time he come in here.
You hear that, Nick? Yes, you bet.
Where's my insurance policy?
Oh, here. - Oh, no, please, no go out this way, Mr. Bailey. - I'm all right.
No, no, you no feel so good.
Sit down and rest. - I'm all right.
- Please no go away.
Please!
Now look what you did.
My great-grandfather planted this tree.
Hey, you! Hey, you!
Come back here, you drunken fool!
Get this car out of here!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help! Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
My wife gave me this on my last birthday.
I passed away in it.
How did you happen to fall in?
I didn't fall in. I jumped in to save George.
You what? To...to save me?
Well, I did, didn't I?
You didn't go through with it, did you?
- Go through with what?
- Suicide.
Well, it's against the law to commit suicide around here.
Yeah, it's against the law where I come from, too.
- Where do you come from? - Heaven.
That's why I jumped in. I knew if I were drowning you'd try to save me.
And you see, you did, and that's how I saved you.
Very funny.
Your lip's bleeding, George.
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.
Oh, no, no, no, George, I'm the answer to your prayer.
That's why I was sent down here.
How do you know my name?
I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
- What are you, a mind reader or something? - Oh, no.
- Well, who are you then?
- Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
Odbody... A-S-2.
Wh-Wh-What's that A-S-2?
Angel Second Class.
Hey, what's... with you... wh-wh-what-did you say just a minute ago?
Why'd you want to save me? That's what I was sent down for.
I'm your guardian angel.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money.
- Eight thousand dollars. - Yeah, I'll say. Just things like that.
Now how do you know that?
I told you.
I'm your guardian angel.
I know everything about you.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get.
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I haven't won my wings yet.
That's why I'm an angel second class.
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings. Oh, I-I've got to earn them and you'll help me, won't you?
- Sure, sure. How?
- By letting me help you.
Only one way you can help me.
Y-You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you? Oh, no, no.
We don't use money in heaven.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting.
Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
I found it out a little late.
I'm worth more dead than alive.
Now look, you mustn't talk like that.
I won't get my wings with that attitude.
You just don't know all that you've done.
If it hadn't been for you...
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody'd be a lot better off.
My wife, and my kids, and my friends. And my...
Look, little fellow, why, you go off and haunt somebody else, will you?
No, no, you don't understand. I've got my job.
Aw, shut up, will you?
Hmmm, this isn't gonna be so easy. Yeah!
So you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh?
Oh, I don't know.
I suppose it would have been better if I'd never been born at all.
- What'd you say? - I said I wish I'd never been born.
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.
You... Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
That's an idea.
What do you think?
Yeah, that'll do it.
All right.
You've never been born.
What did you say?
You've never been born. You don't exist.
You haven't a care in the world.
No worries, no obligations, no eight thousand dollars to get, no Potter looking for you with the sheriff.
- Say something else in that ear. - Sure. You can hear out of it.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.
I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid.
Must have been that jump in that cold water.
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
What's happened?
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it?
Well, I, uh... What's happened here?
What I need is a couple of good stiff drinks.
How about you, angel, you want a drink?
Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry...
Those are dry.
What do you know about that? Stove's hotter than I thought.
Now, come on, get your clothes on, and we'll stroll up to my car and get...
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll, you fly.
I can't fly.
I haven't got my wings. You haven't got your wings.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, this is where I left my car and it isn't here.
You have no car. Well, I had a car and it was right here.
I guess somebody moved it.
- Good evening. - Oh, say...
Hey... wh-where's my car.
- I beg your pardon?
- My car, my car.
I'm the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree.
What tree? What do you mean, what tree?
This tree.
Here. I ran into it.
Cut a big gash in the side of it there.
You must mean two other trees. You had me worried. One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.
Pottersville.
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.
I mean Pottersville.
Don't you think I know where I live?
What's the matter with you?
Either I'm off my nut, or he is. ...or you are.
It isn't me!
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's.
Well, come on, Gabriel. - Clarence!
- Clarence! Clarence!
Martini is a friend of mine.
There's a place to sit down, sit down.
Hey, where's Martini? - You want a Martini?
- No, no, Martini. - Your boss.
Where is he?
- Look, I'm the boss.
You want a drink or don't you?
Okay, all right.
Double bourbon, will you? Quick, huh.
Okay.
I was just thinking. Uh...
It's been so long since I...
Look, Mister, I'm standing here waiting for you to make up your mind.
That's a good man.
I was just thinking, uh, of a flaming rum punch.
Not nearly cold enough. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I got it.
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light on the cloves.
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!
Hey, look, Mister, we serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast.
And we don't need any characters around to give the joint atmosphere. Is that clear? Or do I have to slip you my left for a convincer?
What's he talking about?
Nick, Nick, just give him the same as mine.
He's okay. Okay.
What's the matter with him?
I never saw Nick act like that before.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, li-li-little fellow, you worry me.
- You know, y-y-you got someplace to sleep? - No. You don't, huh?
- Well, y-y-you got any money?
- No. No wonder you jumped in the river.
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
- Oh, that's right. - Oh-oh.
- Somebody's just made it.
- Made what?
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here. Why? Don't they believe in angels?
A...
Yeah, they believe in angels.
Oh, oh! Why should they be surprised when they see one?
Aw, he never grew up. He's... How old are you, anyway, Clarence?
Two hundred and ninety-three, uh, next May.
Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window.
Look, Nick, what's wrong? And that's another thing.
Where do you come off calling me Nick?
Well, Nick, that's your name.
What's that got to do with it?
I don't know you from Adam's off ox.
Hey! Hey, you, rummy there! Come here!
Come here!
Didn't I tell you never to come panhandling around here, huh?
Mr. Gower!
What...what is he...
Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey!
- Don't you know me?
Throw 'em out. Throw 'em out!
Mr. Gower...
Hey, what is... Hey, Nick, Nick...
Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?
You know, that's another reason for me not to like you.
That rum head spent twenty years in jail for poisoning a kid.
If you know him, you must be a jailbird yourself.
Uh, would you show these gentlemen to the door?
Sure. This way, gentlemen.
Hey! Get me!
I'm giving out wings!
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the capsule...
What do you mean I wasn't there?
I remember distinctly.
What the... hey, what's going on around here?
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.
I told you, George.
I'm your guardian angel.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.
What are you?
- You are hypnotist? - No, of course not.
Well, then why am I seeing all these strange things?
Don't you understand, George?
It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
You're nobody.
You have no identity.
Oh, what do you mean, no identity?
My name's George Bailey.
There is no George Bailey.
You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy.
They're not there, either. - What?
- Zuzu's petals.
You've been given a great gift, George... a chance to see what the world would be like without you.
Wait a minute here.
Aw, this is some sort of a funny dream I'm having here.
So long, Mister, I-I'm going home. - Home?
What home? - Now shut up!
Cut it out!
You're... You're...
You're crazy.
That's what I think.
You're...
You're screwy and you're driving me crazy, too!
I'm seeing things here.
I'm going home and see my wife and family.
You understand that? And I'm going home alone!
How am I doing, Joseph? Thanks.
No, I didn't have a drink!
Hey, hey. - Where did the Building and Loan move to?
- The building and what?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
They went out of business years ago.
That guy is a liar!
I know everything's shot in this town.
- I know...
- Hey, Violet.
Hey, listen, that's Violet Bick!
- I know that girl.
Take a walk.
Beat it.
Hey, Ernie, Ernie... Ernie, take me home.
I've gone off my nut!
- Where do you live? - Aw, now, doggone it,
Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff.
You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore.
- Now hurry up.
- Okay.
Three-twenty Sycamore?
- Yeah, yeah, hurry up.
Zuzu's sick.
- All right. All right.
Look here, Ernie, straighten me out here.
Look, I-I've got some bad liquor or something.
I want you to listen to me.
Now, you are Ernie Bishop, and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid?
That's right, isn't it? You seen my wife?
Seen your wife!
I've been to your house a hundred times.
Look, bud, what's the idea?
I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid...
And I ain't never seen you before in my life, see? Okay. Just step on it.
Just get me home.
- Of course, it's the place.
Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
I don't know, but we'd better keep our eye on this guy.
He's bats.
Mary!
Janie!
Zuzu!
Where are you?
They're not here, George.
You have no children.
Where are they? What have you done with them?
All right, put up your hands.
No fast moves.
Come on out here, both of you.
Bert! Thank heaven, you're here.
- Stand back!
- Bert, what's happened to this house?
Wh-Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
Watch him, Bert.
- Come on, come on. - Bert, Ernie!
What's the matter with you two guys?
You-You-You were here on my wedding night.
You, both of you, stood out there on the porch and sung to us, don't you remember?
- Look, now why don't you be a good kid and we'll take you into a doctor.
- Everything's gonna be all right. Now...
- Bert, now listen to me.
Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house?
Bert! Listen! It's that fellow there.
He says he's an angel.
He's tried to hypnotize me.
I hate to do this, fella, but...
Run, George!
Help!
Joseph, help!
- Oh, shut up!
- Help, oh, Joseph, Joseph!
Where'd he go?
I had him right here.
Well, which way'd they go?
Help me find 'em.
Well?
What do you want?
Mother, this is, this is George.
I thought sure you'd remember me.
George who? If you're looking for a room, there's no vacancy.
Oh, Mother, listen.
Please help me.
Something terrible's happened to me.
I-I-I don't know what it is.
Something's happened to everybody.
Please let me come in.
- Keep me here until I get over it.
- Get over what?
I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
Look, I know everybody you know.
Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.
- You know him?
- Well, sure I do.
- When'd you see him last?
- Today over at his house.
That's a lie.
He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business.
And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Strange, isn't it?
Each man's life touches so many other lives and when he isn't around he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?
I've heard of things like this. You've got me in some kind of a spell, or something.
Well, I'm going to get out of it.
I'll get out of it.
I know how, too.
I...
The last man I talked to before all this stuff started happening to me was Martini.
Sure I know where he lives.
He lives in Bailey Park.
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore.
All I know is this should be Bailey Park.
But where are the houses? You weren't here to build them.
Your brother, Harry Bailey, broke through the ice and was drowned at the age of nine.
Harry Bailey went to war!
He got the Congressional Medal of Honor!
He saved the lives of every man on that transport.
Every man on that transport died.
Harry wasn't there to save them, because you weren't there to save Harry.
You see, George, you really had a wonderful life.
Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away? - Clarence...
- Yes, George?
- Where's Mary?
- Oh, well, I...
I...
I can't do...
I don't know how you know these things,
- but tell me, where is she?
- I...
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
I'm not supposed to tell.
Please, Clarence, tell me where she is.
- You're not going to like it, George.
- Where is she?
She's an old maid.
She never married.
Where's Mary, where is she?
- She is... - Where is she?
She's just about to close up the library!
Aw, there must be some easier way for me to get my wings.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary, Mary, Mary... Mary, it's George.
Don't you know me?
What's happened to us?
- I don't know you, let me go!
- Mary, please!
Oh, don't do this to me.
Please, Mary, help me. Where's our kids?
I need you, Mary!
Help me, Mary! Mary...
Let me go!
- Mary, don't run away! - That man, stop him!
Tom!
Ed!
Charlie!
That's my wife!
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Somebody call the police!
- Hit him with a bottle!
He needs a straight jacket. Mary!
Clarence!
Get out of here!
- Clarence!
- Where are you? Oh, it's you!
Stand back!
Clarence!
Clarence! Clarence!
Help me, Clarence.
Get me back.
I don't care what happens to me.
Get me back to my wife and kids.
Help me, Clarence, please.
Please! I want to live again.
I want to live again.
I want to live again.
Please, God, let me live again.
Hey, George.
George!
You all right. Hey, what's the matter?
Now get out of here, Bert or I'll hit you again!
What the Sam Hill you, you yelling for, George!
You... George?
Bert, do you know me?
Know you?
Hum, are you kidding'?
I've been looking all over town, trying to find you.
I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe you... Hey, your mouth's bleeding.
Are you sure you're all right?
What did you...
My mouth's bleeding, Bert!
My mouth's bleed...
Zuzu's petals, Zuzu's... There they are!
Bert!
What do you know about that?
Merry Christmas!
Well, Merry Christmas! Mary!
Mary!
Yaa!
Yaa!
Hello, Bedford Falls!
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, George!
Merry Christmas, movie house!
Merry Christmas, Emporium!
Merry Christmas, you wonderful old Building and Loan!
Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!
Happy New Year to you...in jail.
Go on home.
They're waiting for you.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner. How are you?
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit.
- I know.
Eight thousand dollars.
George, I've got a little paper here.
I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest. Isn't it wonderful?
I'm going to jail.
Merry Christmas!
Reporters?
Wh-Where's Mary?
Oh, look at this wonderful old drafty house.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Have you...
Have you seen my wife?
- Merry Christmas, Daddy!
- Merry Christmas, Daddy!
Kids!
Pete!
Oh!
Kids! Janie!
Janie!
Tommy!
Oh, let me look at you.
Oh, I could eat you up.
- Where is your mother?
- She went looking for you with Uncle Billy. - Daddy!
- Zuzu!
Zuzu!
My little gingersnap!
How do you feel? - Fine!
Not a smitch of temperature.
- Not a smitch of tempe...
Hallelujah!
- George! George!
- Mary!
Mary!
George, darling!
Where have you been?
- Oh, George, George, George.
- Mary!
Let me touch you.
Let me touch you.
Oh, you're real!
Oh, George... George.
You have no idea what happened to me.
You have no idea what happened.
Well, well, come on, George, come on downstairs, quick.
They're on their way.
- All right.
- Come on!
Come on in here now.
Now, you stand right over here, by the tree.
Right there, and don't move, don't move.
What's happening?
Who's gonna come?
I hear 'em coming now, George, it's a miracle!
- It's a miracle! - Who's coming?
Who's gonna come, Daddy?
- Who, Daddy? - I don't know.
Come in, Uncle Billy.
Everybody! In here!
Isn't it wonderful?
So many faces! Mary did it, George!
Mary did it!
She told some people you were in trouble and then, they scattered all over town collecting money.
They didn't ask any questions - just said:
"If George is in trouble, count me in...
What is this, George?
Another run on the bank?
Here you are, George, Merry Christmas.
The line forms on the right.
Merry Christmas!
God bless you.
- Oh, Mr. Martini!
- Merry Christmas!
Step right up here.
I busted the jukebox, too!
Mr. Gower!
I made the rounds of all my charge accounts.
- Violet Bick!
- I'm not going to go, George.
I changed my mind.
I've been saving this money for a divorce, if ever I get a husband.
There you are, George.
I got the faculty all up out of bed.
And here's something for you to play with.
I wouldn't have a roof over my head if it wasn't for you, George.
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Quiet, everybody.
Quiet, quiet.
- I just got this.
It's from London.
- Oh.
Mr. Gower cabled you need cash.
Stop.
My office instructed to advance you up to twenty-five thousand dollars.
Stop.
Hee-haw and Merry Christmas.
Sam Wainwright.
Mr. Martini.
How about some wine?
Hark, the Herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born king.
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled.
Joyful all ye nations rise,
Join the triumph of the skies,
With angelic hosts proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem,
Harry Bailey.
George, old son of a gun.
- Harry!
Harry!
- Looks like I got here too late.
Mary, I got him here from the airport as quickly as I could.
The fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard.
Harry, how about your banquet in New York?
Oh, I left right in the middle of it as soon as I got Mary's telegram.
Good idea, Ernie, a toast... to my big brother George.
The richest man in town!
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind,
Should auld acquaintance
Be forgot, and days of Auld Lang Syne.
What's that?
That's a Christmas present from a very dear friend of mine.
Look, Daddy.
Teacher says every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.
That's right.
That's right.
Atta boy, Clarence.
For Auld Land Syne, my dear.
For Auld Land Syne
We'll take cup of kindness yet,
For Auld Lang Syne
We'll take cup of kindness yet,
For Auld Lang Syne
- You weren 't supposed to relieve me.
I know, but I felt like taking a shift.
You like him, don 't you?
You like watching him. -Don 't be ridiculous.
- We 're gonna kill him. You understand?
Morpheus believes he is the One.
-Do you?
-It doesn 't matter what I believe.
You don 't, do you?
-Did you hear that?
-Hear what? Are you sure this line is clean?
Yeah, of course I'm sure.
I better go.
-Hands on your head!
Do it!
Do it now!
Oh, shit.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders.
I'm just doing my job.
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion" crap, you can cram it up your ass. The orders were for your protection.
I think we can handle one little girl.
I sent two units! They're bringing her down now!
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
I don't know how. I know. They cut the hard line.
There 's no time.
Get to another exit. -Are there any agents?
- Yes. Goddamn it.
You have to focus, Trinity.
There 's a phone at Wells and Lake.
You can make it.
-All right.
-Go.
Just get up. Get up.
It doesn't matter.
The informant is real.
We have the name of their next target.
The name is Neo.
It has already begun.
What the hell?
"Follow the white rabbit. "
It's Choi.
I know.
It's her fault. You got the money?
Hold on.
You're my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ. You get caught using that....
I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.
-Right.
-Something wrong, man?
You look a little whiter than usual.
My computer, it....
Ever have that feeling where you're not sure if you're awake or dreaming? All the time.
It's called mescaline.
It's the only way to fly.
It just sounds like you need to unplug.
Get some R and R? What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?
No, I can't.
I have work tomorrow. Come on.
It'll be fun.
I promise.
Yeah. Sure.
I'll go.
-How do you know that name?
-I know a lot about you. -Who are you?
-My name is Trinity.
Trinity.
That cracked the irs D-base?
That was a long time ago.
-Jesus.
-What?
I just thought you were a guy.
Most guys do.
That was you on my computer. How did you do that?
Right now, all I can tell you is that you're in danger.
-I brought you here to warn you.
-Of what?
They're watching you, Neo.
-Who is?
-Please just listen.
I know why you're here, Neo.
I know what you've been doing.
I know why you hardly sleep why you live alone and why, night after night you sit at your computer.
You're looking for him.
I know, because I was once looking for the same thing.
And when he found me he told me I wasn't really looking for him I was looking for an answer.
It's the question that drives us, Neo.
It's the question that brought you here.
You know the question just as I did.
What is the Matrix?
The answer is out there, Neo.
It's looking for you.
And it will find you if you want it to. Shit. Shit, shit.
You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson.
You believe that you are special, that the rules do not apply to you.
Obviously, you are mistaken.
This is one of the top software companies in the world because employees understand they are part of a whole.
Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem.
The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson.
Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth or you choose to find another job.
Do I make myself clear? Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.
Thomas Anderson?
Yeah, that's me.
Hello, Neo.
Do you know who this is?
- Yes.
I've been looking for you.
I don 't know if you 're ready to see what I want to show you.
But unfortunately, you and I have run out of time.
They're coming for you, and I don 't know what they're going to do. Who's coming for me?
Stand up and see for yourself.
-What?
Right now?
- Yes.
Now.
Do it slowly.
The elevator.
Oh, shit!
I don 't know.
If you don 't want to find out, get out of there.
I can guide you, but you must do exactly as I say.
The cubicle across from you is empty.
-But what if they-- -Go. Now.
Stay here for just a moment.
When I tell you, go to the end of the row to the office at the end of the hall.
Stay as low as you can.
Now, outside there is a scaffold.
-How do you know this? - We don 't have time.
To your left there 's a window.
Go to it.
Open it.
Take the scaffold to the roof. No way!
No way! This is crazy!
There are two ways out of this building. One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.
You take a chance either way. I leave it to you.
This is insane!
Why is this happening to me? What'd I do?
I' m nobody.
I didn't do anything. I' m gonna die.
Oh, shit!
I can't do this.
As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
It seems that you've been living two lives.
In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson program writer for a respectable software company.
You have a social security number. You pay your taxes.
And you help your landlady carry out her garbage.
The other life is lived in computers where you go by the hacker alias "Neo" and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for.
One of these lives has a future.
And one of them does not.
I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson.
You're here because we need your help.
We know that you've been contacted by a certain individual.
A man who calls himself "Morpheus. "
Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant.
He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive.
My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you.
But I believe you wish to do the right thing.
We're willing to wipe the slate clean give you a fresh start.
All we're asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.
Yeah.
That sounds like a really good deal.
But I got a better one.
How about I give you the finger and you give me my phone call.
Mr. Anderson you disappoint me.
You can't scare me with this gestapo crap. I know my rights.
I want my phone call.
Tell me, Mr. Anderson what good is a phone call if you're unable to speak?
You're going to help us, Mr. Anderson whether you want to or not.
This line is tapped, so I must be brief.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.
If they knew what I know you would probably be dead.
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?
You are the One, Neo.
You may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent my entire life looking for you.
Now, do you still want to meet? -Y es.
- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.
Get in.
-What's this? -It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection. -From what?
-From you.
T ake off your shirt.
Stop the car.
Listen, coppertop.
We don't have time for 20 Questions.
Right now, there's only one rule:
Our way or the highway.
Fine.
Please, Neo, you have to trust me. -Why?
-Because you have been down there.
You know that road.
You know exactly where it ends.
And I know that's not where you want to be.
Apoc, lights.
Lift up your shirt.
-What's that?
-You're bugged.
Try and relax.
Come on. Come on.
It's on the move.
Come on, you shit.
-You're gonna lose it. -No, I'm not.
Clear!
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real? !
This is it.
Let me give you one piece of advice.
Be honest.
He knows more than you can imagine.
At last.
Welcome, Neo.
As you no doubt have guessed I am Morpheus.
It's an honor to meet you.
No the honor is mine.
Please, come. Sit.
I imagine that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole?
You could say that.
I can see it in your eyes.
You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he's expecting to wake up.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.
Do you believe in fate, Neo?
-No.
-Why not?
I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
I know exactly what you mean.
Let me tell you why you're here.
You know something.
What you know, you can't explain.
But you feel it.
You felt it your entire life.
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.
Like a splinter in your mind driving you mad.
It is this feeling that has brought you to me.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
The Matrix?
Do you want to know what it is?
The Matrix is everywhere.
It is all around us.
Even now, in this very room.
You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television.
You can feel it when you go to work when you go to church when you pay your taxes.
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
What truth?
That you are a slave.
Like everyone else, you were born into bondage born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.
A prison for your mind. Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.
This is your last chance.
After this, there is no turning back.
You take the blue pill the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
You take the red pill you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Remember all I'm offering is the truth.
Follow me.
Apoc, are we on-line?
Almost.
Time is always against us.
Please take a seat there.
You did all this?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.
It disrupts your carrier signals so we can pinpoint your location.
What does that mean?
It means buckle your seat belt, Dorothy because Kansas is going bye-bye.
Did you...?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
What if you were unable to wake from that dream?
How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?
-This can't be.
-Be what?
Be real?
Going into replication.
-Still nothing.
-It's cold.
It's cold!
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.
-I got a fibrillation.
-Apoc, location.
Targeting almost there.
He's going into arrest.
-Lock. I got him!
-Now, Tank, now!
Welcome to the real world.
We've done it, Trinity.
We found him.
-I hope you're right.
-I don't have to hope.
I know it.
Am I dead?
Far from it.
He still needs a lot of work.
What are you doing?
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.
Why do my eyes hurt?
You've never used them before.
Rest, Neo.
The answers are coming.
Morpheus, what's happened to me?
-What is this place?
-More important than "what" is "when. "
-When?
-You believe it's the year 1 999 when in fact, it's closer to 21 99.
I can't tell you exactly what year it is because we honestly don't know.
There's nothing I can say that will explain it for you.
Come with me. See for yourself.
This is my ship.
The Nebuchadnezzar. It's a hovercraft.
This is the main deck.
This is the core where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix.
Most of my crew you already know.
This is Apoc Switch and Cypher.
The ones you don't know: Tank and his big brother, Dozer.
The little one behind you is Mouse.
You wanted to know what the Matrix is?
Trinity.
Try to relax.
This will feel a little weird.
This is the Construct.
It's our loading program.
We can load anything, from clothing to equipment weapons training simulations anything we need.
Right now we're inside a computer program?
Is it really so hard to believe?
Your clothes are different. The plugs in your body are gone.
Your hair has changed.
Your appearance now is what we call "residual self-image. "
It is the mental projection of your digital self.
This isn't real?
What is "real"?
How do you define "real"?
If you're talking about what you can feel what you can smell, taste and see then "real" is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
This is the world that you know.
The world as it was at the end of the 20th century.
It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix.
You've been living in a dream world, Neo.
This is the world as it exists today.
Welcome to "the desert of the real. "
We have only bits and pieces of information.
But what we know for certain is that in the early 21 st century all of mankind was united in celebration.
We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to Al.
Al. You mean artificial intelligence. A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines.
We don't know who struck first, us or them.
But we know that it was us that scorched the sky.
They were dependent on solar power and it was believed that they would be unable to survive without an energy source as abundant as the sun.
Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive.
Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.
The human body generates more bioelectricity than a 1 20-volt battery.
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.
Combined with a form of fusion the machines had found all the energy they would ever need.
There are fields, Neo, endless fields where human beings are no longer born.
We are grown.
For the longest time, I wouldn't believe it.
And then I saw the fields with my own eyes watched them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living.
And standing there, facing the pure, horrifying precision I came to realize the obviousness of the truth.
What is the Matrix?
Control.
The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world built to keep us under control in order to change a human being into this.
No.
I don't believe it.
It's not possible.
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.
Stop!
Let me out!
Let me out!
I want out!
-Easy, Neo.
Easy. -Get this thing out of me.
Get this thing out of me!
Don't touch me!
Stay away from me!
I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I don't believe it.
-He's gonna pop.
-Breathe, Neo.
Just breathe.
I can't go back, can l?
No.
But if you could would you really want to?
I owe you an apology.
We have a rule.
We never free a mind once it's reached a certain age.
It's dangerous.
The mind has trouble letting go.
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.
I did what I did because I had to.
When the Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside who had the ability to change whatever he wanted to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
It was he who freed the first of us taught us the truth.
As long as the Matrix exists the human race will never be free.
After he died the Oracle prophesied his return and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix end the war bring freedom to our people.
That is why there are those of us who spent our lives searching the Matrix looking for him.
I did what I did because I believe that search is over.
Get some rest.
You're going to need it.
For what?
Your training.
Morning.
Did you sleep?
You will tonight.
I guarantee it.
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
-You don't have any--
-Holes?
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 1 00% pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.
Born free right here in the real world.
Genuine child of Zion.
-Zion?
-lf the war was over tomorrow Zion's where the party would be.
It's a city?
The last human city.
The only place we have left.
Where is it?
Deep underground near the Earth's core, where it's still warm.
You live long enough, you might see it.
Goddamn!
I gotta tell you, I'm excited to see what you're capable of if Morpheus is right and all.
We're not supposed to talk about this, but if you are it's a very exciting time.
We got a lot to do. We gotta get to it.
We're supposed to start with these programs first.
That's major boring shit. Let's do something more fun.
How about...
I'm going to learn jujitsu?
Holy shit!
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it. "
How about some more?
Hell, yes.
Hell, yeah.
How is he?
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.
I know kung fu.
Show me.
This is a sparring program similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix.
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.
These rules are no different than those of a computer system.
Some of them can be bent.
Others can be broken.
Understand?
Then hit me, if you can.
Good!
Adaptation.
Improvisation.
But your weakness is not your technique.
Morpheus is fighting Neo.
How did I beat you?
You're too fast.
Do you believe that my being stronger or faster has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
You think you're breathing air?
Again!
Jesus Christ, he's fast!
His neuro-kinetics are way above normal.
What are you waiting for?
You're faster than this.
Don't think you are.
Know you are.
Come on! Stop trying to hit me, and hit me!
I don't believe it.
I know what you're trying to do.
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.
But I can only show you the door.
You have to walk through it.
Tank, load the jump program.
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear doubt and disbelief.
Free your mind.
Okey-dokey.
Free my mind.
What if he makes it?
-No one's ever made their first jump.
-But what if he does?
-He won't. Come on.
All right.
No problem.
Free my mind.
No problem.
What does that mean?
It doesn't mean anything.
Everybody falls the first time.
Right, Trin?
-I thought it wasn't real.
If you're killed in the Matrix you die here?
The body cannot live without the mind.
I don't remember you ever bringing me dinner.
There is something about him, isn't there?
You're a believer now?
I keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why not take him to see the Oracle?
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
The Matrix is a system, Neo.
That system is our enemy.
But when you're inside, what do you see?
Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters.
The very minds of the people we are trying to save.
But until we do, these people are a part of that system and that makes them our enemy.
You have to understand most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.
And many of them are so inert so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it.
Were you listening to me or looking at the woman in the red dress?
Look again.
Freeze it.
This isn't the Matrix?
It's another training program designed to teach you one thing:
If you are not one of us, you are one of them.
-What are they? -Sentient programs.
They can move in and out of any software still hardwired to their system.
That means that anyone we haven't unplugged is potentially an agent.
Inside the Matrix they are everyone and they are no one.
We have survived by hiding and running from them but they are the gatekeepers.
They're guarding all the doors and holding all the keys.
Sooner or later, someone will have to fight them.
Someone? I won't lie to you, Neo.
Every single man or woman who has fought an agent has died.
But where they have failed, you will succeed.
Why? I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.
Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air.
Yet their strength and speed are still based in a world built on rules.
Because of that they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
What are you telling me?
That I can dodge bullets?
No, Neo.
I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready you won't have to.
We got trouble.
-Did Zion send the warning?
Shit.
-Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
-Squiddy? A sentinel. A killing machine designed for one thing.
Search and destroy.
Set her down there.
How are we doing, Tank?
Power off-line.
EMP armed...
-...and ready.
-EMP? Electromagnetic pulse. Disables any electrical system in the blast radius.
-Where are we? -Their old service and waste systems.
Sewers.
There used to be cities that spanned hundreds of miles.
Now these sewers are all that's left.
You scared the bejesus out of me.
-Sorry.
-ls that...?
-The Matrix?
-Do you always look at it encoded?
-Well, you have to. The image translators work for the construct program.
But there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.
Do you want a drink?
Sure.
You know I know what you're thinking.
Because right now I'm thinking the same thing.
Actually, I've been thinking it ever since I got here.
Why, oh, why didn't I take the blue pill?
Good shit, huh?
Dozer makes it.
It's good for two things:
Degreasing engines and killing brain cells.
So can I ask you something?
Did he tell you why he did it?
Why you're here?
Jesus!
What a mind job.
So you're here to save the world.
What do you say to something like that?
A little piece of advice.
You see an agent you do what we do:
Run. You run your ass off.
Thanks for the drink.
Sweet dreams.
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
You know I know this steak doesn't exist.
I know that when I put it in my mouth the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious.
After nine years you know what I realize?
Ignorance is bliss.
Then we have a deal.
I don't want to remember nothing.
Nothing.
And I want to be rich.
You know, someone important.
Like an actor.
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
Okay.
You get my body back in a power plant reinsert me into the Matrix I'll get you what you want.
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
No. I told you, I don't know them.
I can get you the man who does.
Morpheus.
Here you go, buddy.
Close your eyes, it feels like you're eating runny eggs.
Or a bowl of snot.
Tastee Wheat.
Did you ever eat T astee Wheat? No, but technically, neither did you.
That's exactly my point.
Exactly.
Because you have to wonder how do the machines really know what T astee Wheat tasted like?
Maybe they got it wrong.
Maybe what I think T astee Wheat tasted like actually tasted like oatmeal or tuna fish.
That makes you wonder.
T ake chicken, for example.
Maybe they didn't know what to make it taste like which is why it tastes like everything.
-And maybe they--
It's a single-celled protein...
Everything the body needs.
It doesn't have everything the body needs.
I understand you've run through the agent training program.
You know, I wrote that program.
Here it comes.
-What did you think of her?
-Of who?
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.
She doesn't talk very much but if you'd like to meet her, I can arrange a more personal milieu.
The digital pimp hard at work. Pay no attention to these hypocrites, Neo.
T o deny our own impulses is to deny the very thing that makes us human.
Dozer, when you're done bring the ship up to broadcast depth.
We're going in. I'm taking Neo to see her.
See who?
Everyone, please observe the "fasten seat belt" and "no smoking" signs are on.
Sit back and enjoy your flight.
Unbelievable isn't it?
-God!
-What?
Really good noodles.
I have these memories from my life.
None of them happened.
What does that mean?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
But an oracle can?
Did you go to her?
Yes.
She told me....
We're here.
Come with me.
So is this the same oracle that made the prophecy?
Yes.
She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.
-The beginning?
And she knows what?
She would say she knows enough.
And she's never wrong.
Try not to think of it in terms of right and wrong.
She is a guide, Neo.
She can help you to find the path.
She helped you?
What did she tell you?
That I would find the One.
I told you I can only show you the door.
You have to walk through it.
Hello, Neo.
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
These are the other Potentials.
Do not try and bend the spoon.
That's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth.
What truth?
There is no spoon? Then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends.
The Oracle will you see now.
I know you're Neo.
Be right with you.
-You're the Oracle?
Not quite what you were expecting, right?
Almost done.
Smell good, don't they?
I'd ask you to sit down but you're not going to anyway.
-And don't worry about the vase.
That vase.
I'm sorry.
I said, don't worry about it. I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
What's really going to bake your noodle later on is would you still have broken it if I hadn't said anything?
You're cuter than I thought.
I can see why she likes you.
Who?
You know why Morpheus brought you to see me.
So what do you think?
Do you think you are the One?
You know what that means?
It's Latin.
Means, "Know thyself. " I'll let you in on a little secret.
Being the One is just like being in love.
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it through and through.
Well I'd better have a look at you.
Okay....
Now I'm supposed to say, "Hmm, that's interesting, but.... "
Then you say:
But what? But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
-I'm not the One.
You got the gift but it looks like you're waiting for something.
-What?
-Your next life, maybe.
Who knows?
That's the way these things go.
-What's funny?
He almost had me convinced.
I know. Poor Morpheus.
Without him, we're lost.
What do you mean, "without him"?
Are you sure you want to hear this?
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.
And no one, not you, not even me can convince him otherwise.
He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
-What? -You're going to have to make a choice.
In the one hand, you'll have Morpheus' life.
And in the other hand, you'll have your own.
One of you is going to die.
Which one will be up to you.
I'm sorry, kiddo.
I really am.
You have a good soul. And I hate giving good people bad news.
Don't worry about it.
As soon as you step outside that door you'll start feeling better.
You'll remember you don't believe in any of this fate crap.
You're in control of your own life.
Here take a cookie.
I promise, by the time you're done eating it you'll feel right as rain.
What was said was for you and for you alone.
What did you just say?
Nothing.
Just déjà vu.
-What happened?
A black cat went past us then another just like it.
Was it the same cat?
I'm not sure.
What is it?
A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix when they change something.
They cut the hard line.
That's what they changed.
We're trapped.
Be calm. Give me your phone.
They'll be able to track it.
We have no choice.
Operator. Find a structural drawing of this building.
-Got it!
Eighth floor.
They're on the eighth floor.
Switch, straight ahead.
I hope the Oracle gave you some good news.
Now left.
They' re in the walls.
You must get Neo out!
He's all that matters!
No, Morpheus!
Trinity, go!
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.
And you are?
A Smith.
Agent Smith.
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.
All of a sudden, boom.
Somebody up there still likes me.
I got you.
Just get me out of here fast.
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
-Operator.
- Tank, it's me. Is Morpheus alive?
Is Morpheus alive, T ank?
Yes. They're moving him.
I don 't know where.
-He's alive. We need an exit.
-You' re not far from Cypher.
-Cypher? -I know.
-I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
Where are they?
Making the call.
I don't know.
Hello, Trinity.
You know for a long time I thought I was in love with you.
I used to dream about you.
You' re a beautiful woman, T rinity.
Too bad things had to turn out this way.
You killed them.
-What?
I' m tired, T rinity.
I' m tired of this war tired of fighting.
I' m tired of this ship of being cold, of eating the same goddamn goop every day.
But most of all I'm tired of that jackoff and all of his bullshit.
Surprise, asshole!
I bet you never saw this coming did you?
God, I wish I could be there when they break you.
I wish I could walk in just when it happens so right then you'd know it was me.
-You gave them Morpheus.
-He lied to us, Trinity.
He tricked us!
If you had told us the truth we would've told you to shove that red pill up your ass!
-That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free. - "Free. "
All I do is what he tells me to do.
If I had to choose between that and the Matrix I choose the Matrix.
The Matrix isn't real.
I disagree, Trinity.
I think the Matrix can be more real than this world.
All I do is pull the plug here.
But there you have to watch Apoc die.
Welcome to the real world.
But you' re out.
- You can 't go back.
-That's what you think.
They'll reinsert my body.
I go back to sleep.
When I wake up, I won 't remember a thing.
By the way if you have anything important to say to Switch...
-...say it now.
-No, please don't.
Not like this.
T oo late.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
Don't hate me, Trinity.
I'm just a messenger.
And right now, I'm going to prove it to you.
If Morpheus was right there's no way I can pull this plug.
If Neo 's the One then there'd have to be some kind of a miracle to stop me.
Right?
I mean, how can he be the One if he's dead?
You never did answer me before if you bought into Morpheus ' bullshit.
Come on.
All I want is a little yes or no.
Look into his eyes those big, pretty eyes and tell me yes or no.
Y es.
I don't believe it. Believe it or not, you piece of shit, you' re still going to burn!
You' re hurt.
Have you ever stood and stared at it?
Marveled at its beauty its genius?
Billions of people just living out their lives.
Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world where none suffered where everyone would be happy.
It was a disaster.
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.
Some believe that we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world.
But I believe that, as a species human beings define their reality through misery and suffering.
So the perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.
Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this.
The peak of your civilization.
I say, "your civilization" because when we started thinking for you, it became our civilization which is, of course, what this is all about.
Evolution, Morpheus.
Evolution.
Like the dinosaur.
Look out that window.
You had your time.
The future is our world, Morpheus.
There could be a problem.
-What are they doing to him?
-They're breaking into his mind.
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time. How much time?
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack and his alpha patterns will change from this to this.
When it does, he'll tell them anything they want to know.
What do they want?
The leader of every ship is given codes to Zion's mainframe computer.
If an agent got the codes and got into Zion's mainframe they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.
Zion's more important than me or you or even Morpheus.
There has to be something we can do.
You're going to kill him?
Kill Morpheus?
Never send a human to do a machine's job.
If the insider has failed they'll sever the connection as soon as possible, unless--
They're dead.
In either case--
We have no choice.
Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.
Morpheus, you were more than a leader to us.
You were a father.
Stop!
I don't believe this is happening.
-Neo, this has to be done.
I don't know.
This can't be just coincidence.
-What are you talking about?
She told me this would happen.
She told me that I would have to make a choice.
-What are you doing?
-I'm going in.
-No, you're not. -I have to.
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself so that we could get you out.
There is no way that you're going back in.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed I'm something I'm not.
-What?
-I'm not the One, Trinity.
-The Oracle hit me with that too.
-No, you have to be.
I'm sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy.
No, Neo, that's not true.
It can't be true.
This is loco.
They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building. Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.
Three of them.
I want Morpheus back too, but what you're talking about is suicide.
That's what it looks like, but it's not.
I can't explain to you why it's not.
Morpheus believed something, and he was ready to give his life for it.
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.
-Why? -Because I believe in something.
What?
-What are you doing?
-Going with you.
-No, you're not. -"No"?
Let me tell you what I believe.
Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.
I believe if you are serious about saving him, you will need my help.
And since I am the ranking officer if you don't like it, I believe you can go to hell.
Because you aren't going anywhere else.
Tank load us up.
I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here.
It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals.
Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops an equilibrium with the surrounding environment.
But you humans do not.
You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.
The only way you can survive is to spread to another area.
There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.
Do you know what it is?
A virus.
Human beings are a disease.
A cancer of this planet.
You are a plague.
And we are the cure.
Okay, so what do you need?
Besides a miracle.
Guns.
No one has ever done anything like this.
Why isn't the serum working?
Perhaps we're asking the wrong questions.
Leave me with him.
Hold on, Morpheus.
They're coming.
Can you hear me, Morpheus?
I'm going to be honest with you.
I hate this place this zoo this prison this reality, whatever you want to call it.
I can't stand it any longer.
It's the smell.
If there is such a thing.
I feel saturated by it.
I can taste your stink.
And every time I do, I fear that I have somehow been infected by it.
It's repulsive.
Isn't it?
I must get out of here.
I must get free.
And in this mind is the key.
My key.
Once Zion is destroyed, there is no need for me to be here.
Do you understand?
I need the codes.
I have to get inside Zion and you have to tell me how.
You're going to tell me or you're going to die.
Please remove any metallic items you're carrying.
What were you doing?
He doesn't know.
Find them and destroy them!
Only human.
-How did you do that? -Do what? You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.
It wasn't fast enough.
Can you fly that thing?
Not yet.
Operator.
I need a pilot program for a B-212 helicopter.
I knew it.
Do you believe it now, Trinity?
The Oracle.
-She told me--
-She told you what you needed to hear.
That's all.
Sooner or later you'll realize, just as I did there's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Operator.
-It's good to hear your voice. -We need an exit.
Damn it!
The trace was completed.
-Sentinels are standing by.
Neo, I want to tell you something but I'm afraid of what it could mean if I do.
Everything the Oracle told me has come true.
Everything but this.
-What happened?
-Send me back. -I can't.
Mr. Anderson.
I'm going to enjoy watching you die Mr. Anderson.
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?
That is the sound of inevitability.
It is the sound of your death.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
My name is Neo.
-I don't know. I lost him.
Sentinels.
-Five, maybe six minutes.
Tank, charge the EMP.
-We can't use that until he's out.
-I know. Don't worry.
He's gonna make it.
Flat or pumps?
No, just-- What the shit?
That guy took my phone!
-Got him! He's on the run.
-Mr.
Wizard get me out of here!
Help!
Need a little help!
The door on your left.
Oh, no.
They' re inside.
I' m not afraid anymore.
The Oracle told me that I'd fall in love with that man.
The man that I love would be the One.
So you see you can't be dead.
You can't be because I love you.
You hear me?
I know you're out there.
I can feel you now.
I know that you're afraid.
You're afraid of us.
You 're afraid of change. I don 't know the future.
I didn 't come here to tell you how this is going to end.
I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.
I'll hang up this phone.
And then I'll show these people what you don 't want them to see.
I'm going to show them a world without you.
A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries.
A world where anything is possible.
Better hurry.
Here you go, my friend.
Make sure you get us as close as you can!
I'll give you something extra if you make it a good trip.
I'm going to get you close, but not too close.
You don't want to be eaten.
-Ready, amigo?
-Ready!
One, two, three!
Eric, heave!
Scared?
This is great.
See anything yet?
No, not yet.
-What was that?
-I don't know.
Hold on!
What's happening?
Just hold on!
Make it stop!
What happened to them?
I don't know.
Oh, my God.
We're going to crash! BEN:
No, we're not.
I'm going to take this loose!
-Let go of the rope!
-We're gonna crash!
Move your hands!
Come onl
Here we go!
It's going be okay, bud.
Charlie, those are herbivores.
They wouldn't fight each other.
But these are carnivores, and they really like fighting each other.
They use their teeth and their claws to rip each other's throats out.
Alan, he's three.
Let's wait till he's five.
Right.
Sorry, Charlie.
-Ellie? -Yeah?
It's Tom.
He says he has to talk to you about the last chapter.
Tell him I won't lose the Horner quote.
My editor thinks he's a paleontologist.
Hey, Mark!
Hey, babe, look who's here.
This is Alan.
Nice to meet you, Alan.
Daddy, this is a herbivore and that's the dinosaur man.
Dinosaur man?
Jack, say my name.
Is my name Alan?
Is my name Alan?
He used to know me.
-It's sad, huh? -Here you go.
Thanks.
Mark's been working for the State Department now.
What do they do, Mark?
International relations, mostly treaty law, things like that.
-Call of the wild one.
-I'll go.
You guys catch up.
Thanks, babe.
He's a great guy.
-So, what are you working on now?
-Raptors, mostly.
My favourite.
Do you remember the sounds they made?
I try not to.
All our theories about Raptor intelligence what they were capable of, we weren't even close.
-Tell me.
-We did cranial scans of a fossil skull and found a very sophisticated resonating chamber.
Wait a second.
So we were right.
-They'd the ability to vocalise.
-It's the key to their social intelligence.
Which explains why they could work as a team.
They'd coordinate attacks so their prey wouldn't know what was going on.
-They could talk to each other.
-To a degree we never imagined.
Ellie, they were smart.
They were smarter than dolphins or whales.
They were smarter than primates.
I just wanted to say, if you ever need help, sometimes you forget to ask.
So you can call me.
Anything, anytime.
Sure.
You're still the best.
I mean that.
The last of my breed.
It is through the study of the anterior chamberin multiple specimens that we can determine the correlation between the upperpalate and the larynx.
This lets us theorise, theorise, mind you that the Raptor was capable ofsophisticated vocalizations which would have been a tremendous evolutionary advantage.
Raptors were fierce, intelligent and socially sophisticated.
They were able to hunting numbers and coordinate their efforts.
Were it not for the cataclysmic events which overtook them it's entirely possible that Raptors rather than humans would have become the dominantspecies on this planet.
I hope this has been ofinterest.
It certainly excites us as paleontologists.
There is much more to discover.
Thatis why we continue to need, and ask for, yoursupport.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Dr. Grant.
Now, does anyone have a question?
Fine.
Does anyone have a question that does not relate to Jurassic Park?
Or the incidentin San Diego which I did not witness?
Yes, sir?
Your theory on Raptors is good, butisn't all this conjecture kind of moot?
Once the U.N. and Costa Rica and everyone decide how to handle thatsecond island scientists willjust go in and look for themselves.
Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.
Whatis left of them is fossilised in the rocks.
And itis in the rock that real scientists make real discoveries.
What John Hammond and lngen did at Jurassic Park is create genetically engineered theme park monsters.
Nothing more and nothing less.
Are you saying you wouldn't want to visit Isla Sorna and study them if you had the chance?
No force on Earth or Heaven could get me on thatisland.
What we got here, Nashy?
Einhorn 20-millimetre, gas-operated semi-automatic.
10-shot, magazine fed, rotating bolt recoil-reducing muzzle brake.
High explosive--
Udesky.
-It's Paul Kirby.
Just checking--
-Yes, sir.
We're good to go here.
Matter of fact, I can lock things down just as soon as you drop me that payment.
Well, that's right two of the very best men I could possibly find.
No, I haven't worked with them personally but believe me, sir, both of these men come very highly recommended.
Are you all right?
Nothing to worry about, sir.
It's gonna be a walk in the park.
Billy, I don't think I'm doing this right.
Let's try the toothbrush.
You've got to go slowly.
Just take a little bit at a time.
I can never tell what's rock and what's bone.
Technically, it's all rock.
The calcium in the bones is replaced during fossilization.
But you can feel the difference.
See?
Rough smooth.
Rough, smooth.
Dr. Grant.
Mr. Brennan.
So, how did it go?
Well, it's not too late to change your major, Billy.
-That good, huh?
-Worse.
We'll to have to pack up in four weeks.
Three.
I had to rent some equipment.
Come here.
I got to show you something.
-You like computers, right?
-I like the abacus, Billy.
-Meet the future of paleontology.
It's a rapid prototyper.
I enter the scanned data from the Raptor skull.
The computer breaks it down into thousands of slices.
And this thing sculpts it, one layer at a time.
It's done.
I give you the resonating chamber of a Velociraptor.
Listen to this.
Wow.
This is brilliant, Billy.
Really, it is.
Sad to say, it's just a little bit late.
Dr. Grant?
Paul Kirby, Kirby Enterprises.
My card.
How you doing, Billy?
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
First thing, I'm a great admirer of yours.
And I have a proposition I'd like to discuss with you.
Would you have dinner with my wife and me this evening?
-It'll be our treat.
-That'd be great but I'm tired, I've been travelling.
Maybe some other time.
Believe me, this will be worth your while.
-We'd love to. -Oh, terrific!
That's the spirit.
Good.
This evening then.
Billy, thank you for coming.
Dr. Grant, how are you?
Amanda, this is Billy and Dr. Grant.
Mrs. Kirby, how are you?
What are you boys drinking?
-Ice Pick, Catfish. -Two, please, Cat.
-We've admired your work for years.
-Really.
Truly inspiring.
Amanda and I just love the outdoors.
We've been on nearly every adventure tour they can come up with:
The Nile, Galapagos, K2.
We even have two seats reserved on the first commercial flight to the moon.
For our wedding anniversary this year, we wanted to do something really special.
-Something--
-Once in a lifetime.
I've chartered an airplane to fly us over Isla Sorna.
And we'd like you to be our guide.
There you go, guys.
That's a very kind offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm a very, very busy man.
I can recommend a couple of guys who are really highly qualified--
No, no.
You're the best.
You've seen these animals in the flesh.
There's no one who comes close to you.
You wouldn't be able to fly low enough to see anything of any real interest.
That's the interesting part, because we have permission to fly low.
How low?
I'm no aviation expert, but a heck of a lot lower than anybody else.
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
That's hard to believe.
Through my business dealings, import-export, emerging markets I've made a lot of friends in high places.
In this case, the Costa Rican government.
Dr. Grant, you have no idea how important it is that you come along.
It would make all the difference.
Mrs. Kirby, l--
And, of course, we'd love to make a contribution to your research here.
So I could write all kinds of numbers on this cheque, Dr. Grant.
Tell me what's it gonna take?
Even with what I pay you, couldn't you afford a better bag?
No way.
This one's lucky.
Couple of years ago, some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand.
And this big updraft came and swept me right against the side. Wham!
That does sound lucky.
It was this strap alone that saved my life.
Got hooked on a rock as I was falling.
Reverse Darwinism.
Survival of the most idiotic.
Alan, I want to thank you for bringing me along.
The bones will still be there when we get back.
That's the great thing about bones.
They never run away.
And truth is, you got me into this.
And I have no intention of being on my own with these people.
Don't get too excited.
Chances are, we won't see a thing.
Your turn to be nice.
Wake me when we get there.
So how do you know the Kirbys?
Through our church.
Alan.
Alanl
Wake up.
We're almost there.
Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla Sorna this is San Juan Approach.
You're flying in restricted airspace.
Immediately turn to coordinates two--
My God, I had forgotten.
We did it, honey.
We're here.
Cooper!
if you see anything, yell up!
No, I thought I'd keep it to myself.
Everyone, if you look out the left of the plane you can see a whole herd of Brachiosaurus.
In fact, you can see at the front of the group the alpha male grazing there.
Udesky? Nash?
How about up front?
You guys see anything?
Nothing yet, Mr. Kirby.
Mrs. Kirby, look!
Out here, you'll see a group of....
Mr. Kirby, we have a landing strip.
You want me to put her down? No!
I told you, I want to circle first, see the whole island.
What do you mean?
You can't land!
Hold on.
I can explain--
You cannot land on this island!
-It will be fine.
-Don't worry, please.
-Are you crazy? -Sit down!
Will you please sit down?
Billy tell me we didn't land.
Ericl
Benl
I think they're looking for someone.
Benl
Dr. Grant, are you all right?
I'm sorry we had to be so rough.
ALAN: Who hit me? Who hit me?
That would be Cooper.
What are they doing?
Setting up a perimeter to make the place safe.
Trust me, on this island, there's no such thing as safe!
We have to get back on that plane!
Tell your wife to stop making that noise!
That is a very, very bad idea!
-Amanda! -Benl
Honey, Dr. Grant said that's a bad idea!
What?
He says it's a bad idea!
What's a bad idea?
What was that?
That's a Tyrannosaurus. I don't think so.
It sounds bigger.
We have to leave!
We have to leave now!
Get on the plane!
Get on the plane!
-What about the other guy?
-Cooper's a professional. He can handle himself.
Get on the plane!
It's all right.
-Paul, we can't-- -It's all right.
We'll circle the island.
Give me a hand, Udesky!
Stop!
What are you doing?
That's Cooper!
Stop.
Come on, get out of the way!
You know I can't stop this plane.
Oh, my God!
Fuel cut-off!
We're going down!
You okay?
We're okay up here.
Everyone, juststay put.
San Juan Approach.
Mayday, maydayl
Who has the satellite phone?
I do.
I got it right here.
We're not getting anything.
The radio's gone.
We haven't landed yet.
-All circuits are busy. -Damn it!
Oh, man.
What was that?
Keep still!
Keep still!
Relax.
What is it?
What?
-What is it?
-Hold it!
Hang on, everyonel
Help me!
Mrs. Kirby, come back!
Amanda!
Follow me!
This way!
In here!
I think we lost him.
It's okay, it's dead.
Nobody move a muscle.
No, no!
Please, don't!
Stop, please.
It's time you did some explaining, Mr. Kirby.
We called everyone.
We did everything we could.
No one would help us.
The Costa Rican government said this is a no-fly zone.
The U.S. Embassy, that's our U.S. Embassy told us we should accept the inevitable.
You let a 12-year-old go parasailing alone?
-No!
-He was with a friend.
Ben Hildebrand.
Paul and I divorced over a year ago.
All right, why me?
He said we needed someone who'd been on the island before.
Yes, but I did not tell you to kidnap somebody.
I have never been on this island.
Sure you have.
You wrote that book.
That was Isla Nublar.
This is Isla Sorna, Site B.
You mean there are two islands with dinosaurs?
-Stay out of this.
-How long have they been missing?
-Eight weeks.
-Almost eight weeks now.
Billy. We'll go back to the plane, salvage what we can.
Then we make for the coast.
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving this island without our son.
Then you can go and look for him.
Oryou can stick with us, as long as you don't hold us up.
Either way you probably won't get off this island alive.
So?
What do we do?
We search for your son in the direction that they're going.
Excellent.
Sorry.
It's nothing you haven't seen before, Paul.
How much weight did you say you lost?
About 25 pounds.
I've been swimming.
Swimming?
You hate to swim.
You don't even know how to swim.
I know.
I learned.
-You look good.
-So do you.
-How would you classify it, Billy?
-Well it's a super-predator.
A Suchomimus.
-That snout.
-No, think bigger.
-Baryonyx?
-Not with that sail.
Spinosaurus aegypticus.
-I don't remember that on lngen's list.
-Because it wasn't on their list.
And it makes you wonder what else they were up to.
So, Mr. Kirby, tell me.
When you climbed K2 did you base camp at 25,000 or 30,000 feet?
30,000 feet.
We were pretty close to the top.
You were about 1,000 feet above it, actually.
No, that's a common mistake.
There's no such thing as Kirby Enterprises, is there?
It's Kirby Paint and Tile Plus.
The "Plus" stands for bathroom fixtures.
We're in the Westgate Shopping Centre, Enid, Oklahoma--
I don't suppose that cheque you wrote us is any good.
I will pay you the money I owe you.
ALAN: This is good.
Here we are, in the worst place in the world, and we're not being paid!
Wait, fellas. Hold on! I'll make this up to you.
If you ever do a bathroom or a kitchen....
-You're not a mercenary, are you?
-I never said I was.
That's true.
What are you?
I'm like a booking agent.
One of the guys got sick and couldn't come.
Excuse me.
Here.
-So you run a hardware store?
-Paint and tile, yeah.
-You never can tell about people, can you?
-Ain't that the truth?
-Eric!
-Quiet.
Would you stop that?
Dr. Grant says this is very dangerous territory.
Maybe we should split up. -We could cover twice as much. -Dr.
Grant says that's a bad idea.
Dr. Grant says this--
Why hire an expert if we don't use his advice?
Except Dr. Grant isn't looking for Eric.
-He's looking for the coast.
-Go ahead and scream.
When that "Tricycloplots" attacks you, don't come crying to me.
-Don't worry about that.
-What?
What did you say?
-What did you say? -Never mind!
Paul, just drop it!
If we split up, I'm going with you guys.
-Eric! -Eric!
Kirby! Mrs. Kirby! -Eric!
Mrs. Kirby, the chances are remote they're still in the vicinity.
Young adult.
Hey, guys!
That's my camera.
The battery's dead.
I've got an idea.
Let me have the camera.
Where were you on that one, Ma?
Okay, dive.
Dive.
Come on, Ma.
-Eric.
-Ma, you were supposed to catch itl
I shot this the morning they disappeared.
PAUL: I want that.
Let me take that.
Come on, give me that.
Come on, baby.
See anything yet?
No, notyetl
What was that?
Unclip us.
-There's a big clipl
-I can'tsee. I can't do itl
-I'm going to unhook you, all right?
One, two, threel
Are you okay, buddy?
I'm gonna drop myself down now.
The camera's still on.
He's alive.
I know he's alive.
We're gonna find him.
Can you fly one of those?
Maybe.
As long as the sail is not torn.
Well, let's take it.
If we spot a plane, it might be a good way to get attention.
Pull it over this way.
I got it, hold on! Okay. Okay.
My God!
Okay, you're free.
Get her back, Mr. Kirby!
Amanda!
Waitl
Amanda!
Amanda, stop.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about Ben.
It's not Ben, Paul.
It's Eric. He's out there all by himself.
I know, I know.
Our baby is out here all by himself.
Listen to me.
We'll find him.
I promise.
Paul.
Dr. Grant!
You should come look at thisl
Raptor.
We're going to find him.
Are you listening to me?
We're going to find him.
Kid's got resources.
Remember what it was like to try to ground him?
Where's Billy?
What are you doing?
I was photographing the nest.
Don't do that again.
I'm sorry.
If I lose you, it's just me and the damn tourists.
I bet you Eric is in there.
Don't you think?
I'd bet my bottom dollar!
What do you think it is?
As far as I'm concerned, it's the Four Seasons.
-Eric! -Paul!
Don't.
What the hell.
Who's got some change?
It only takes quarters.
I've got $1.10.
This is how you make dinosaurs?
No.
This is how you play God.
This way!
It's locked!
-This way, this way!
-Hey, over here!
Push, push!
My God.
He's calling for help.
Come on!
Into the herd!
Head for the trees!
Udesky.
Mr. Kirby!
-Billy?
-Is Alan with you?
Oh, my God.
Mr. Udesky!
He's dead.
Oh, my God. No, he's not.
No, wait.
Something's not right.
We've got to help him.
Amandal
Hold on!
They set a trap.
They actually set a trap.
What are you saying?
What are you looking for?
Wait!
Thanks.
Thanks a lot, Eric.
You know who I am?
Yeah.
Your parents are here.
They're looking for you.
Together?
Together.
That's not good.
They don't do so well together.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have to.
You're Alan Grant.
What are you doing here?
Your parents invited me along.
I read both of your books.
I liked the first one more.
Before you were on the island.
You liked dinosaurs back then.
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me yet.
When lngen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Any weapons?
No, and I just used the last of the gas grenades.
And I appreciate that.
Be careful with that.
T-Rex.
It scares the smaller ones away but it attracts one really big one with a fin.
This is T-Rex pee?
How did you get it?
You don't want to know.
-Dessert?
-Sure.
I have to tell you, I'm astonished you've lasted eight weeks on this island.
Is that all it's been?
You're alive and that's the important thing.
Thanks to you, that's one thing we have in common.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Yeah.
So?
I don't know.
I mean....
It was kind of preachy.
And too much chaos.
Everything is chaos.
Seemed like he was high on himself.
That's two things that we have in common.
Listen.
Compys!
Alan!
No matter how this turns out it wasn't your fault.
Eric's always been a strong-willed kid.
Always.
Then you throw someone like Ben Hildebrand into the mix and well.
Well, what?
All I'm saying is, it's not your fault.
No.
If he'd been with you, he'd be completely safe.
You drive five miles under the speed limit.
And I've totalled three cars in three years.
Well, not three.
The Buick wasn't really totalled.
I just said it was, because I wanted to get the S.U.V.
I am so sorry that you have to be here.
I'm not.
There's a boat, right alongside the bank.
-Looks in good shape.
-A rescue boat?
No, no.
Just something left behind.
But it floats.
We stick to the plan.
Head for the coast.
You're not gonna look for Dr. Grant?
The coast was Alan's idea.
If he's alive, that's where he's headed.
PAUL: I agree.
What about Eric?
Eric's a smart kid.
He probably knows his best chance is by the coast.
He figures the big dinosaurs are in the centre of the island.
Right?
Sure.
You know what this is?
It's a Raptor claw.
I used to have one.
A fossil.
Mine is new.
How much of the island did you explore?
I stayed pretty close to the compound.
I figured if anyone came looking for me, that's where they'd start.
We need to get to the coast.
That was the plan.
Are you sure?
The closeryou get to water, the bigger things get.
If we can find our way down into the canyon we can follow that river out to the coast.
After we find your parents.
Then what?
-One step at a time.
-Listen.
What?
That's my dad's satellite phone!
Wait a minute.
How do you know?
"Kirby Paint and Tile Plus, in Westgate!"
Dad!
-Eric! -Eric!
Eric! This way!
Mum!
Dad!
Mum, Dad!
Mum, Dad!
I knew it.
My God.
I knew it.
Oh, God.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Hey, you got my bag.
Yeah.
Lucky strap.
Want me to carry it?
We need to find a gap here.
-How did you know we were here?
-The phone.
That stupid jingle from the store. I heard it.
-My phone?
-Your satellite phone.
-Where is it?
-I don't have it.
-When did you use it last?
-On the plane.
I got a call on the plane and....
-What?
-I loaned it to Nash.
He must have had it when he--
Run.
Alan, you want to give me the bag back?
It's okay, I got it.
Please, give me the bag.
It's not safe.
Raptor eggs.
Did you steal Raptor eggs?
Now it all makes sense.
I swear, if I'd known you were going to end up with them....
It was an impulse, I thought they'd be worth a fortune.
Enough to fund the dig site another 10 more years.
You have to believe me.
This was a stupid decision, but I did it with the best intentions.
"With the best intentions."
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions.
You know what, Billy?
As far as I'm concerned you're no better than the people that built this place.
What are you doing?
Those things are after us because of those.
Those things know we have the eggs.
If I drop them in the river, they'll still be after us.
-What if they catch us with them?
-What if they catch us without them?
There's a boat at the bottom, just downriver.
We can try and make it to the coast, atleast.
-You okay?
-Yeah.
Let's do this one at a time, shall we?
Okay, come on over!
One at a time!
All right, Eric.
I'm going to leave you just for a minute.
And then you'll be right behind me, okay?
Mum!
I've been alone in a water truck for eight weeks.
I think I can manage the next two minutes without you.
Right, we're all together now.
Okay, Eric.
-Okay.
-Come on, honey!
Over you go.
Mum?
Oh, my God.
-What is it?
-It's a birdcage.
For what?
Dadl
Eric!
I can't see him!
No!
This way!
Billy, stopl Don't, Billyl
Eric, hold on!
Eric!
Jump!
Billy!
Let go now!
-Eric!
-He's there.
There he is!
He's across the river!
Get him out of here!
-No!
-Go, Eric!
What about Billy?
Hang on, Billy!
Wait.
Get away!
There's plenty of gasoline.
Now we've just got to make our way to the coast.
Work out some sort of a signal.
Build a fire or something. Something they can see from the air.
Dr. Grant?
Hey, Eric, how are you doing?
I'm sorry about Billy.
You know what the last thing I said to him was?
I said:
"You're as bad as the people that built this place."
Which wasn't true.
Billy was just young. That's all.
I have a theory that there are two kinds of boys.
There are those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
The astronomer, or the paleontologist gets to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety.
-But then you never get to go into space.
-Exactly.
It's the difference between imagining and seeing.
To be able to touch them.
And that's all Billy wanted.
Dr. Grant.
You know something, Dr. Grant?
Billy was right.
Listen.
Find it before it stops!
Eric, you stay on that boat.
It's here.
It's here.
God.
I got it.
Hello?
Hello?
You too can own a timeshare in beautiful Guadalajara.
Enjoy a meal in one of our four-star restaurants.
Look out!
Turn off the power.
You've got juice for maybe one call.
Whateveryou do, don't call the U.S. Embassy.
They won't do a damn thing.
Hey, guys, come here!
Look at this!
-Bonitos.
-Something must have spooked them!
Get the engine going, Mr. Kirby.
Open the throttle!
Pick up.
Hello?
Ellie?
Hello?
Charlie!
-Charlie!
-Hello?
Charlie, take the phone to Mummy now!
Take the phone to Mummyl
It's the dinosaur man!
-Okay.
-Listen to me, Charlie.
Charliel
Are you taking the phone to Mum?
Charliel
Oh, ho-hol Hi, everybodyl
It's great to be herel
Hi, therel How are you?
This is going to be great.
-Who's on the phone?
-The dinosaur man.
He is?
Alan?
Look in the boxes!
Find a weapon!
Where's the phone?
-There!
-Get the phone!
Ellie, listen to me!
Are you on a cell phone?
I can't hear you.
The river!
Site B!
The riverl
Hello?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Paul, you jerk!
You can't leave me like this!
I'm not going anywhere!
Remember when we went fishing a couple of summers ago?
I was putting the boat in the water and the trailer sank?
The tow truck tried to pull us out and it got dragged in, too.
The truck driver wanted to knock my lights out.
I miss fishing.
Mr. Kirby?
That lady you called. Who is she?
How do you know that she can help us?
She's the one person I could always count on.
I owe her a lot.
-I don't think I ever told her that.
-You should.
You hear that?
The ocean.
They want the eggs.
Otherwise, we'd be dead already.
Everybody get down.
She's challenging us.
She thinks you stole the eggs.
Get behind me.
Give me the eggs.
Do it, Mum.
No.
Call for help.
That's a helicopter.
Dr. Grant?
-Dr. Alan Grant?
-Stop!
That's a very bad idea!
-Second squad, move!
-Wow!
You have to thank her now.
She sent the Navy and the Marines.
God bless you, Ellie.
-Dr. Grant, is this man with you?
-What?
You made it.
Yeah.
I rescued your hat.
-Dr. Grant, we need to go now!
-Oh, yeah.
Well, that's the important thing.
Dr. Grant!
Can I getyou to sit here and buckle up, sir?
Sea Shadow to Dust Storm, six souls on board.
Dust Storm to Sea Shadow, roger.
What the hell is that?
Dr. Grant, look!
Where do you think they're going?
I don't know.
Maybe just looking for new nesting grounds.
It's a whole new world for them.
I dare them to nest in Enid, Oklahoma.
Let's go home.
Open the bag.
Retract the blast doors.
I am Zao. You are late.
Mr. Van Bierk. I've been looking forward to this meeting.
Me too. My African military friends owe you many thanks, Colonel Moon.
Few men have the guts to trade conflict diamonds since the U.H. embargo.
I know all about the U.H. I studied at Oxford and Harvard.
From your modest collection of cars, I wouldn't have guessed.
Show me the diamonds.
Hiding weapons in the de-militarised zone.
- It's a bit of a minefield out there.
RPGs, flamethrowers, automatic weapons and enough ammunition to run a small war.
Mr. Van Bierk, let me show you something.
And how do you propose to kill me now, Mr. Bond?
It's pathetic that you British still believe you have the right to police the world.
But,You will not live to see the day all Korea is ruled by the Horth.
Then you and I have something in common.
Who is it?
Where's my son?
It's the General.
Hello... Father.
Why is there a fire?
Still you jest.
Defiant to the last.
Your people have abandoned you.
Why stay silent?
We reach the end, Mr. Bond. Spare me the unpleasantries.
Fifty years after the superpowers carved Korea in two and then you arrive.
A British spy, an assassin.
And now the hard-liners have their proof.
We cannot trust the West.
You...
Your firing squad should have done the job for me.
I hoped a Western education would help him become a bridge between our worlds.
But all it did was to corrupt him.
Let's get this over with, shall we?
My son had an ally in the West.
For the last time, who was it?
Who made him betray his country and his name?
Zao.
I'm being traded for you.
Keep moving.
Your time will come.
Look at him.
- Reference nine. - Sir.
Section four.
Okay, hold him tight.
No biological agents in the prelim scan. He's clean. Pulse, 72.
Blood pressure, 120/80.
Indications of neurotoxins, histamine, serotonin and enzyme inhibitors.
Scorpion venom.
Note also traces of a venom antiserum.
They'd sting him then administer the antidote.
Liver not too good. It's definitely him then.
You don't seem too pleased to see me.
If I'd had my way, you'd still be in North Korea.
Your freedom came at too high a price.
Zao.
He tried to blow up a summit between South Korea and China.
Took out three Chinese agents before he was caught.
And now he's free.
I never asked to be traded.
I'd rather die in prison than let him loose.
- You had cyanide. - Threw it away years ago.
What the hell is this all about?
The top American agent in the North Korean High Command was executed a week ago.
The Americans intercepted a signal from your prison naming him.
- And they think it's me?
They concluded you cracked and touchring were hemorrhaging information. We had to get you out.
With the drugs they gave you, you wouldn't know what you said.
I know the rules. And number one is, no deals.
Get caught and you're given up.
The mission was compromised.
Moon got a call exposing me.
He had a partner in the West.
Even his father knew about it.
- Whether that's true or not, it's irrelevant.
- No, it isn't. The same person who set me up then has just set me up agian to get Zao out.
So I'm going after him.
the only place You're going to our evaluation center in the Falklands.
Double-O status rescinded. Along with my freedom?
- He's in cardiac arrest.
- Get the crash cart.
Hotify his superiors. - He's flat-lining on the ECG.
- Stand by.
Two hundred joules.
I'm checking out.
Thanks for the kiss of life.
Security breach on level three.
All personnel, defensive code red.
Apprehend and detain with force.
Security breach on level three.
All personnel, defensive code red.
My goodness, standards are falling.
My usual suite, please.
Do you have a credit card?
Or even any luggage, sir?
Mr. Bond, so good to see you.
- It's been a long time. - Mr. Chang.
Open the Presidential Suite.
perhaps you could Send up my tailor.
The lobster's good, with quails' eggs and sliced seaweed.
- And if there's any left, a '61 Bollinger.
Do it... quickly.
I am Peaceful Fountains of Desire, the masseuse.
I'm sure you do. Come in.
Yes, of course.
I'm not that kind of masseuse.
I'm not that kind of customer.
You think I haven't always known you're Chinese Intelligence, Chang?
- Hong Kong is our turf now. - yeah will Don't worry about it.
I'm not here to take it back. Get out Now
Put your hands down.
What the hell do you want? Just to help you settle a score.
Zao killed three of your men.
You get me into North Korea, I'll take care of him for you.
Zao has information I need.
- I'll have to ask Beijing.
It seems Mr. Zao has lost himself in Havana.
I'm here to pick up some Delectados.
We haven't made Delectados in 30 years.
Universal Exports. Check with your boss.
Raoul...i got here some one want delectados.
Universal Exports.
I'd come to think the Delectados would never be smoked.
They are particularly hazardous for one's health, Mr...?
Mr. Bond.
Do you know why?
It's the addition of the Volado tobacco. Slow burning.
It never goes out.
Just like a sleeper.
Sorry for the rude awakening.
I love my country.
I'd never ask you to betray your people.
- I'm after a North Korean.
Zao has no interest in other people's freedom.
I still have some friends in high places.
Favors called in.
Some dollars spread about. We find your friend is here, on an island.
In Los Organos.
There is a strange clinic run by Dr. Alvarez.
He leads the field in gene therapy.
Increasing the life expectancy of our beloved leaders.
And, of course, the richest Westerners.
We may have lost our freedom in the revolution but we have a health system second to none.
it doesn't seem You didn't do too badly out of the revolution.
We all have our ways of getting by.
You'd be surprised how many government officials come to me for reminders of the decadent times.
- Yeah, well...
My sources tell me this Zao is very dangerous.
Mojito, por favor.
About bloody time, Fidel.
Magnificent view.
It is, isn't it?
Too bad it's lost on everybody else. Mojito?
You should try it.
Giacinta Johnson.
My friends call me Jinx.
My friends call me James Bond.
Jinx, you say? Born on Friday the 13th.
Do you believe in bad luck?
Let's just say my relationships don't seem to last. hmmm..
The predators usually appear at sunset. And why is that?
It's when their prey comes out to drink.
Too strong for you?
I could learn to like it.
How much time have you got?
Until dawn. What about you?
I'm just here for the birds. Ornithologist.
Ornithologist, huh? Wow there's a mouthful.
So you're gonna be busy tonight with the owls then?
Nothing to see till the morning. Not out there anyway.
So, what do predators do when the sun goes down?
Are you always this frisky?
I've been missing the touch of a good woman.
Who says I'm good?
What the hell do you want?
- I don't need a goddamn wheelchair.
You do now.
Senor.
- Okay.
- Gracias.
So you are to have DNA-replacement therapy.
Let me explain the two phases.
First, we kill off your bone marrow. Wipe the DNA slate clean.
Phase two:
Introduction of new DNA harvested from healthy donors.
Orphans, runaways people that won't be missed.
I like to think of myself as an artist.
And this is when I create.
Thank you.
It is a painful process, I'm afraid, but all great art is.
I'll certainly enjoy working on you.
Of course, most artists are only truly appreciated after they're dead.
My father was a sergeant.
We lived in Hampshire.
I have fond memories of the countryside.
Good.
Got your attention.
Who's bankrolling your makeover, Zao?
Same person who set me up in North Korea?
James?
What's going on?
Jinx, you gotta get out of here now!
Move!
Move!
Move it!
Let's go!
You see, my friend, the chemical composition shows this is from Sierra Leone.
Conflict diamonds.
Yeahh There's some kind of marking here.
- "GG."
- Let me see.
oh Yes.
From the Graves Corporation in Iceland.
That's his laser signature.
A man called Gustav Graves discovered diamonds there a year or so ago.
Yet they're identical to conflict diamonds.
What an amazing coincidence.
How can he escape from a British warship...
Rihgt..in the middle of Hong Kong harbor, right under your nose?
- Interesting station, Moneypenny?
- I got a storm warning.
You were supposed to throw away the key not leave the door wide open.
Are you implying I had a hand in his escape?
Well, Bond got away real fast, didn't he?
It is what he's trained to do.
Your boy's been very busy in his training.
He show up in Cuba and torches a clinic.
Listen, you put your house in order or we're gonna do it for you.
Your drink, sir.
Lucky I asked for it shaken.
- When's he coming?
- Looks like your man not gonna make it.
What a Wonderful day to become a knight.
Will you be using your title, Mr. Graves?
I'm proud of my adopted nation, but I'd never stand on ceremony.
After that entrance, you can't be surprised you're called a self-publicizing adrenaline junkie, can you?
I prefer "adventurer. " We've heard about the Icarus space program.
What's the secret?
it is not a secret It's a surprise. But don't worry You'll soon be enlightened.
You seem to work 24/7.
Is it true that you don't need sleep?
You get one shot at life.
Why waste it on sleep? Aren't you trying out for place in the British fencing team?
- We hear you're training furiously.
- I never get furious. As they say in fencing, "What's the point?"
Allright everybody thank you ver much.
i am sure you understand We don't want to keep Her Majesty waiting any longer.
- Mr. Graves.
Hit.
That's a hit.
Hit.
Verity?
James Bond.
Your lesson.
I see you handle your weapon well.
I have been known to keep my tip up.
Do you mind? I think I've come undone.
Why not?
Hit.
Positions. Play.
Feast your eyes on the finest blade in the club.
Gustav Graves?
My protege. Gorgeous, isn't she?
She took the gold at Sydney.
- By default, if I remember.
- Default? The one who beat her OD'd on steroids.
Miranda deserved that gold.
and Now she's teaching Graves how to win one.
He only plays for cash.
He's won so much, nobody else wants to fight him.
You wanna meet him?
Absolutely.
Lead on.
- Gustav?
- Verity.
- And Mr...?
James Bond.
- Have we met before?
- I think I'd remember.
Of course you would.
My mistake.
- Are you a gambling man, Mr. Bond?
- if the stakes are right. A thousand a point too much for you?
Care to place a bet, Verity?
No, thanks.
I don't like cockfights.
Shall we?
Excuse me.
Best of three hits?
Positions.
Ready. Play.
En garde.
Hit.
Positions.
Play.
Hit.
Two-nil.
Do you want to continue?
- You wanna up the wager? - How much can you afford?
Let's play for this.
I picked it up in Cuba.
I believe it's one of yours.
My, my.
They do get around.
But then diamonds are for everyone.
Brilliant specimen.
Completely flawless.
And chemically identical to African conflict diamonds.
Then you're about to lose something very precious.
Positions.
Ready.
- Play.
Oh, dear.
You want to continue?
Of course I want to bloody continue!
But since we're upping the wager let's up the weapons, shall we?
Let's do this the old-fashioned way.
First blood drawn from the torso.
That is enough!
It's just a little sport, Miranda.
Seems you beat me, Mr. Bond.
Settle downstairs, shall we?
You're a rare challenge, Mr. Bond.
I'm putting on a scientific demonstration in Iceland at the weekend.
Perhaps you could join us.
Miranda, make the arrangements. Once I've smoothed things over with the club.
What would I do without you?
Can I expect the pleasure of you in Iceland?
I'm afraid you'll never have that pleasure Mr.Bond.
Excuse me, Commander Bond.
Place needed to be redecorating anyway.
I heard of this place.
Never thought I'd find myself here.
Some things are best kept underground.
An abandoned station for abandoned agents.
- Your calling card.
- So, what have you got on Graves?
You burn me and now you want my help?
I know you'll do whatever it takes to get the job done.
- Just like you.
- The difference is, I won't compromise. Well, I don't have the luxury of seeing things as black and white.
- While you were away, the world changed.
You're suspicious of Graves, or I wouldn't be here right now.
- So, what do you have? - Nothing beyond the official biography.
Orphan working in an argintinian diamond mine learns engineering, makes a huge find in Iceland and gives half of it to charity.
From nothing to everything in no time at all.
- And his demonstration this weekend?
- Probably just another publicity stunt.
Now tell me what you know about this Cuban clinic.
New identities courtesy of DNA transplants.
So-called "beauty parlor. " We'd heard rumors.
I didn't think it really existed.
It doesn't anymore.
Zao got away, but he left these behind.
All from Gustav Graves' mine.
I think it's a front for laundering African conflict diamonds.
We need to tread carefully.
Graves is politically connected.
Lucky I'm on the outside, then.
will it seems you've become useful again.
Then maybe it's time you let me get on with my job.
Forgive my mentioning it 007, but a perfect marksman isn't really supposed to shoot his own boss.
Check the replay.
You'll find he's dead and she's only got a flesh wound.
There's always an excuse, isn't there, double-O zero?
Give me the old firing range any day co-master.
Yes, but it's called the future, so get used to it.
So this is where they keep the old relics, then, eh?
i'll have you know this is where our most cutting-edge technology is developed.
- Point taken.
- Must you touch everything? Does this still work?
- Now, look...
- So where is this cutting-edge stuff?
I'm trying to get to it.
Weapon, please.
One pane unbreakable glass, one standard-issue ring finger.
Twist so. Voila.
Ultra-high frequency single-digit sonic agitator unit.
- You're cleverer than you look.
- still Better than looking cleverer than you are.
Follow me.
Now, a new watch. This will be your 20th, I believe.
- How time flies.
- Yes, well, 007 why don't you establish a record by returning this one.
Your new transportation.
- Maybe you've been down here too long.
- The ultimate in British engineering.
- You must be joking.
- As I learned from my predecessor I never joke about my work.
Aston Martin call it the Vanquish, we call it the Vanish.
- ohh Very good.
- Adaptive camouflage.
Tiny cameras in all sides project the image they see onto a light-emitting polymer skin on the opposite side.
You see to the casual eye, as good as invisible.
Plus, the usual refinements: Ejector seat, torpedoes, target-seeking shotguns to shoot down mobile objects.
why don't you piont out to your self The manual.
Wish I could make you vanish.
Before you leave on your mission for Iceland tell me what you know of James Bond.
He's a double-O.
A wild one, as I discovered today.
He'll light the fuse on any explosive situation and be a danger to himself and others.
Kill first, ask questions later.
His primary method is to provoke and confront.
A man nobody can get close to.
A womanizer.
You're going to be seeing a lot more of him in Iceland.
With great respect, a man like him could blow my cover.
Miss.Roast You volunteered for this operation, but in three months, you've turned next to nothing. Graves seems to be clean.
But Bond thinks differently, so I'm going to let him do what you so ably described:
Mix things up a little with Mr. Graves. and With you there things won't be able to get out of hand.
In your three years in Cryptology, you've manige to keep business and pleasure separate.
You haven't fraternized with any of your fellow agents, despite several advances. i think it would be foolish to get involved with someone within the community.
Especially James Bond.
I'm Mr. Kil.
Well, there's a name to die for.
Three hundred and twenty-four miles an hour.that's that's a new personal best Boss.
Thruster two cut out again.
Get it fixed.
- Glad you could make it Mr.Bond.How did you like my run?
- You were like a man on the edge of losing control.
It's only by being on the edge that we know who we really are. Under the skin.
Take your Donald Campbell. 1967, the Bluebird. Water speed record.
- Campbell died on his return run.
- But he died chasing a dream. - Isn't that the way to go?
- I'd rather not go at all.
- I see you don't chase dreams, you live them.
- one of a virtue of never sleeping Mr.Bond. I have to live my dreams.
Besides, plenty of time to sleep when you're dead.
- ohh Miss Frost.
- I'll show you your room.
A palace of ice.
You must feel right at home.
This whole place was built for tonight's demonstration.
i am told the human element necessitates a pereciese balance of heat and cold. Built on a lake?
I Hope Graves got things right.
- And what's that little property i noticed next door?
- The diamond mine.
And Gustav's living quarters.
Thank you.
Wonderful.
Would you like to show me more?
Vodka martini.
Plenty of ice, if you can spare it.
Mojito?
Here for the penguins this time?
- Or for the view again?
- right now I'm only interested in endangered species. ohh Well, does that include me?
- Depends on what you're up to this time.
- So I left you in an explosive situation.
You are a big boy Figured you could handle yourself.
- ohh i wonder your relationships don't last. - I am a girl that just doesn't like to get tied down.
You look terrible.
You aren't looking too good yourself.
- You're still feeling the side effects? - The insomnia is permanent for me.
An hour on the Dream Machine keeps me sane.
- What happened to you? - Bond.
He knows nothing.
I've been this close to him and he still didn't know who I am really was.
- You saw my father after your exchange? - Yes.
- General Moon still mourns your death.
- My death.
- Swift.
Space and Technology magazine.
I take it Mr. Bond's been explaining his big-bang theory?
-ooh Yeah, I think I got the thrust of it.
The demonstration's about to begin in five minutes. Shall we?
Shall we?
- Not "Jinx" anymore?
- I'll always be a jinx to you.
As you know i'm always trying to give the planet something in return for what it has given me:
Those little shards of heaven known as diamonds.
now Diamonds aren't just expensive stones.
They are the stuff of dreams.
And the means to make dreams real.
Imagine being able to bring light and warmth to the darkest parts of the world imagine being able to grow crops the year-round, bringing an end to hunger.
Imagine a second sun shining like a diamond in the sky.
Let there be light.
I give you Icarus!
Icarus is unique.
Its miraculous silver skin will inhale the sun's light and breathe it gently upon the Earth's surface.
You have no idea how much Icarus is about to change your world.
And now let us brighten this night with our inner radiance.
All right, that's a wrap.
- Vlad, show me the modifications. - Yeah.
Here is the self-defense mechanism you asked me to build in.
- Fifty-thousand volts? - A hundred.
Armed and very dangerous. - Very.
M warned me this would happen.
That's why you tried not to be interested in me.
God, you're even worse than your file says.
They don't look too convinced.
Come on, put your back into it.
remember i know all about you.
Sex for dinner, death for breakfast.But it is not gonna work with me.
- No?
- No.
- You're getting good at this. - ohh Stop it.
Are we still being watched? - They left ages ago.
- God, you're impossible.
com on let's get out of here.
You'd better stay here tonight. Keep up the charade of being lovers.
All right.
I must say i admire your restraint.
You were here a full two hours before anything blew up.
The way you're going, you'll get us both killed.
James, tell me what really happened in North Korea.
I was betrayed. That was all.
Occupational hazard.
This is crazy. You're a double-O.
It's only a number.
James be careful.
Go back to your room.
I'll come back for you.
Why do you want to kill me?
I thought it was the humane thing to do.
Who sent you?
Your mama.
And she told me to tell you she's really disappointed in you.
I'll let you in on a little secret.
This mine is fake, but the lasers are real.
She won't talk.
Let's make it permanent.
I'll use the laser.
Don't leave a mess.
- James! James!
No, no!
Turn it off!
Off!
Off!
James, I could use a little help here.
Switch it off or I'll be half the girl I used to be.
So, the girl who hates to be tied down, huh?
Are you gonna get me off this?
- What are you, CIA? - NSA.
-Hello We're on the same side.
- Doesn't mean we're after the same thing. Sure it does.
World peace, unconditional love and our little friend with the expensive acne.
- Yeah, Zao.
He's back there with some weird, psychedelic light mask.
Probably brought it from the clinic in Cuba.
He couldn't have brought it.
It was already here.
It belongs to another Korean.
His boss.
- We need Kil to help us get out of here. - I got a better idea.
- I'm going to get backup. - Wait.
Go to Miranda first.
She's Ml6.
Warn her to get out.
And what are you gonna do?
Unfinished business.
So you live to die another day colonel.
At last.
I was beginning to think you'd never guess.
Was it painful?
- The gene therapy?
- You couldn't possibly imagine. oh Good.
I'm glad to hear that.
But there have been compensations.
Like watching you flail around in your ignorance.
Granting you life day by day just to see if you'd get wise.
It's been fun.
Well, the fun is about to come to a dead end.
We only met briefly, you and I but you left a lasting impression.
When you forced me to present the world with a new face I chose to model the disgusting Gustav Graves on you.
Just in the details.
That unjustifiable swagger.
Your crass quips, a defense mechanism concealing such inadequacy.
My defense mechanism is right here.
So, Miss Frost is not all she seems.
Looks can be deceptive.
Yes.
by the way did you find out who betrayed you in North Korea?
Only a matter of time.
You never thought of looking inside your own organization?
She was right under your nose.
It was so good of you to bring your gun to bed. Yes.
Occupational hazard.
You see, I have a gift.
An instinct for sensing people's weaknesses. An instinct for sensing people's weaknesses. Yours is women.
Hers and mine is winning, whatever the cost.
so when I arranged for the fatal overdose of the true victor at Sydney I won myself my very own Ml6 agent using everything at my disposal:
Her brains, her talent even her sex.
The coldest weapon of all.
Hello.
Miranda?
There will be others after me.
ohh You mean your American friend, Jinx.
Soon to be the victim of a tragedy.
- An ice palace can be a treacherous place.
- Hand over the toys.
Oh, yeah.
You know, I've missed your sparkling personality.
How's that for a punch line?
Kill him.
I enjoyed last night, James but it really is death for breakfast.
Kill him, quietly.
Kill him.
Now!
- He got away.
-No matter.
The pleasure of the kill is in the chase.
Bring me the generals.
Gentlemen I promised you a demonstration.
Now you will see the true power of Icarus.
The Western spy runs, but he cannot hide.
Icarus will lock on to the heat signature and concentrate the sun's power.
Hey, boss, he beat your time.
Time to draw the line.
Global warming is a terrible thing.
Yeah, nice moves, just like Bond.
He was pretty vigorous last night as well.
He did you?
- I didn't know he was that desperate.
- well he's not coming back for you.
He just died running, trying to save his own skin.
That's pretty good tailoring.
I hope it doesn't shrink when it gets wet.
Soon, we will be victorious.
We've got one hour to wrap this up. Let's move.
Come on, Jinx, where are you?
All units report. Now!
Warning, adaptive camouflage failure.
Time to give the American her bath.
Adaptive camouflage restored.
Vlad, does the word "ergonomics" mean anything to you? Man?
Machine?
This is still a suitcase.
Finish it, will you?
Come on, it's warm in here.
Come on.
The cold kept you alive, huh?
It must've kept you alive.
Come on.
What took you so long? I'm sorry.
Agent Johnson.
- James. - Charles.
Okay, bring us up to speed on this.
Another division mobilized north of the DMZ. 80,000 troops and counting.
- And another million in reserve.
- Moon's father won't let this turn into a war. General Moon's under arrest.
the hard-liners staged a coup last night.
You deliberately misled me by implicating Bond.
- you'd told us about your agent in cubin clinic... - She'd be dead.
- Your mole would've made sure of that .
- We wouldn't have a mole at all if you'd told us that miss.Frost and Moon were on the Harvard fencing team together.
Knowing who to trust is everything in this business.
Well, well, James Bond.
- Just in time for the fireworks. - Let's get down to business.
We're at DEFCOH 2.
And if the North goes south, they're gonna go south big-time.
You don't just stroll through the world bigest minefield.
You need some kind of an edge. - We're taking care of that with an ASAT launch in one hour.
- Where's Graves?
- In the middle of North Korean air base.
They're right where we can't touch him.
You can't but I can.
- Look we're here in case things escalate, not to make sure that they do.
No incursions into the North.
President gave me a direct order.
And when did that ever stop you?
You make your own decision.
I'm sending in 007.
You think I'd leave this in the hands of the British? You go with him.
Approaching drop zone.
Okay, let's go!
- They've entered North Korean airspace. - Relax, Robinson.
If our radar can't see those switchblades, the North Koreans sure as hell can't.
Hey, boss, they launched against Icarus.
Leave it on automatic.
I hope nobody here is superstitious.
That's one big mirror we're about to break.
Oh, my God.
Mobilize the South Korean troops.
And get me the president, now!
Still no news of Bond?
Vehicles.
Some big shots.
It's him.
- Three hundred meters.
- Windage, one and a half.
We gotta get on that plane.
You, have my father brought down.
Father I regret our meeting had to be like this.
You can't tell it's me?
I don't know you.
You've always found it difficult to accept me.
That made my exile easier to bear but I never forgot what you taught me.
In war, the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won.
You see, Father, I remember my Art of War and this is what guarantees that victory.
My son...
What have you done to yourself?
Come, Father.
Watch the rising of your son.
The second that hits the 38th parallel we gonna hit them with everything we got.
That may not be enough.
Do you see, Father?
Icarus is clearing the minefield creating a highway for our troops.
If the Americans don't run, Icarus will destroy them.
Japan is a bug waiting to be squashed and the West will shake with fear.
But the Americans will send nuclear warheads.
Icarus will swat them from the sky.
You will destroy us.
You would kill your own son?
The son I knew died long ago.
Father... you disappoint me.
Caution.
Caution.
- Manual. - Up!
Manual.
- Up! Up!
- Caution.
- Manual. - Come on!
Okay, guys.
Okay.
I got it.
My, my.
You get around.
Let's see your gun.
ah ah Left hand.
That's it.
That's it.
Now drop it.
Looks like your friends have bailed.
Push on autopilot.
Come on.
That's it. Good girl.
Well, drowning you didn't seem to work.
I'll have to try something more to the point.
One thousand meters and closing.
I can read your every move.
Read this.
Bitch.
oh look, parachutes for the both of us.
oops not anymore.
You see, Mr. Bond, you can't kill my dreams.
But my dreams can kill you.
Time to face destiny.
Time to face gravity.
I think I broke her heart.
Looks like we're going down together.
Not yet.
- Get the back open.
- Okay.
Come on!
- Come on.
- I told you I was a jinx.
I should have warned you my relationships don't last either.
At least we're gonna die rich.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Now you said something about going down together?
James.
James. Moneypenny.
Oh, James.
Moneypenny? Moneypenny?
I was just testing it out.
It's rather hard, isn't it?
Yes. Very.
Wait, don't pull it out.
I'm not finished with it yet.
See?
It's a perfect fit.
- ahh ehh Leave it in.
- It's gotta come out sooner or later.
Ho, leave it in, please.
Few more minutes?
We really have to get these back.
Still the good guys, huh?
I'm still not quite sure how good you are.
I am so good.
Especially when you're bad.
Thank you very much and welcome to To Tell the Truth.
Our first guest, he's made a career out of being the most outrageous impostor that we've ever come across on this show and you're going to see what I mean.
ANNOUNCER:
Number One what is your name, please?
My name is Frank William Abagnale. Number Two?
My name is Frank William Abagnale.
Number Three?
My name is Frank William Abagnale. GARAGIOLA:
"From 1(64 to 1(67 "I successfully impersonated
"an airline pilot for Pan Am Airways
"and I flew over two million miles for free.
"During that time, I was also the chief resident pediatrician
"at a Georgia hospital
"and an assistant attorney general
"for the State of Louisiana.
"By the time I was caught, I was considered
"the youngest and most daring con man in U.S. History.
"I had cashed almost $4 million in fraudulent checks
"in 26 foreign countries and all 50 states.
"And I did it all before my 1(th birthday.
My name is Frank William Abagnale."
So, for the first time he's going to have to tell the truth and we're going to start our questioning with Kitty.
Thank you.
Number One, why, with all your talent... and you're obviously a very bright fellow... why didn't you go in for a legitimate profession?
It was really a question of dollars and cents.
When I was a young man, I needed the money and I thought this list of careers was the easiest way to get it.
I see.
Number Two, I find this all very fascinating.
Who was it that finally caught you?
His name was Carl Hanratty.
(French accent): Han-an-an-ratty. Ratty.
(American accent):
Hanratty. Han-ratty.
Carl Hanratty.
- I... am...
Carl Hanratty.
I represent the FBI from the United States of America.
I have orders to see the American prisoner, Abagnale.
You sit here.
You do not open the door.
You do not pass him... anything through the hole.
Aw... Jesus.
You know, I've got a little bit of a cold myself. - Frank...
- (coughing)
I'm here to read the articles of extradition according to the European Court for Human Rights.
"Article One:
Extradition shall be granted
"in respect of offenses punishable under the laws..." (weakly):
Help me.
"...for the maximum period of at least one year of a severe penalty."
Help me.
Frank... stop it.
Help me.
You don't think actually you can fool me, do you?
(raspy coughing) 16 pages to go. Stay with me.
Article Two:
"If the request for extradition
"includes several separate offenses each of which is punishable under the laws..."
(thuds) "Of the requesting party..." Frank?
Frank? Goddamn it!
- Get me a doctor in here!
- (speaking French) - I need a doctor!
- Yes. Doctor!
Now!
HANRATTY:
Don't sweat it, Frank.
We're going to get you right to a doctor.
Frank, if you can hear me, don't worry.
I'm going to take you home in the morning. Home in the morning, Frank.
(men conversing in French)
Washing off the lice.
This man has to be on a plane for America. He has to see a doctor.
The doctor comes in tomorrow.
I have worked too long, too hard for you to take this away from me.
If he dies, I'm holding you responsible.
Monsieur!
Ah, Frank.
Okay, Carl... let's go home.
The New Rochelle Rotary Club has a history that goes back to 1919.
In all those years we've only seen a handful of deserving gentlemen inducted as lifetime members.
It's an honor that, uh that has seen 57 names enshrined on the wall of honor and tonight, we make it 58.
So please stand as I present my very good friend a man who keeps our pencils sharp... (scattered chuckling)
And our pens in ink...
Frank William Abagnale.
I stand here humbled by the presence of Mayor Robert Wagner... (applause) ...and our club president, Jack Barnes.
Most of all, I'm honored to see my loving wife Paula and my son, Frank Jr...
Aw, stand up.
Come on...
(feedback whining): ...sitting in the front row.
Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream.
The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned.
The second mouse... wouldn't quit.
He struggled so hard that eventually he churned that cream into butter and crawled out.
Gentlemen, as of this moment, I am that second mouse.
You're a better dancer than your father, Frankie.
You hear that, Daddy? FRANK SR:
Like fun. PAULA:
The girls don't know what they're in for.
Show him the dance you were doing when we met. Ah, who can remember?
The people in that little French village were so happy to see Americans they decided to put on a show for us.
So they crammed 200 soldiers...
Yeah, we know the story, Daddy.
...into that tiny social hall and the first person to walk onstage is your mother, and she starts to dance.
You know, it had been months since we'd even seen a woman and here's this blonde angel.
Blonde bombshell.
(giggles)
And the men are literally holding their breath.
Holding their breath for you. You hear that?
(giggles) Mm-hmm. And I turned to my buddies and I said...
"I will not leave France without her." And I didn't.
You didn't.
I didn't. (liquid spills)
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit, the rug! Aw, Mom...
I can't believe I did that.
No, no, it's nothing.
It's nothing.
Oh, Frankie, Frankie, get a towel.
- Paula...
Come on.
D My sweet embraceable you... d
Dance with me, Paula. Ah... (giggles) (instrumental interlude playing)
I get in trouble.
(mouthing):
Come on, let's go! Get up.
Come on, come on.
Frank, wake up. (groans):
Dad...
You don't have to go to school today.
It's okay. Why?
Is it snowing?
Do you have a black suit?
I overslept again, huh?
We have a very important meeting in the city. Eat that.
Come on, come on, eat.
Ma'am, open up.
Just open up, please!
- Ma'am? - It's important.
What?
Oh, gosh!
We don't open for half an hour! Open the door, please.
Just open the door.
It's important.
L-I'm sorry, we don't open for half an hour.
What's your name, ma'am?
Darcy.
Darcy. That's a pretty name.
I'm in a bit of a fix.
I need a suit for my kid.
This is my son Frank.
Oh, hi.
He needs a black suit. Black suit...
There was a death in the family.
My father, 85 years old, war hero.
Yeah?
There's a funeral this afternoon, military funeral planes flying overhead, 21-gun salute.
Geez.
Frank needs to borrow a suit for a couple of hours.
I'm sorry, we don't loan suits, and we're not open.
Darcy, please.
- (sighs)
- Come back.
Darcy... is this yours?
(jingles)
I just found it in the parking lot.
Uh-huh.
It must've slipped right off your neck.
Don't hit the curb.
Now get out, walk around the back and hold the door open for me.
All right. What's next?
Okay, stop grinning.
When I get inside, you go back to the front seat and wait.
Even if a cop comes and writes you a ticket you don't move the car, understood?
Dad, wha-what's all this for?
You know why the Yankees always win, Frank?
'Cause they have Mickey Mantle?
No, it's 'cause the other teams can't stop staring at those damn pinstripes.
Watch this.
The manager of Chase Manhattan Bank is about to open the door for your father.
Mr. Abagnale, um we don't usually loan money to people who have unresolved business with the IRS.
That's a misunderstanding.
I hired the wrong guy to do my books. A mistake, I...
anybody could make it.
I just need you guys to help me weather the storm.
Sir, you're being investigated by the government for tax fraud.
My store is a landmark in New Rochelle.
I have customers all over New York.
Well, you're not a customer at Chase Manhattan. We don't know you.
I'm sure your bank in New Rochelle they know you, they could help you out.
My bank went out of business.
Banks like this one put them out of business.
Now, I know I made a mistake, I admit that but these people want blood.
They want my store.
They've threatened to put me in jail.
This is America, right? I'm not a criminal.
I'm a Medal of Honor winner a lifetime member of the New Rochelle Rotary Club.
All I'm asking is for you to help me beat these guys.
It's not a question of winning and losing.
It's a question of risk.
You're the largest bank in the world.
Where's the fu... Whe...
Where's the risk?
Dad, how could you just let him take our car like that? He didn't take anything.
We took him.
He overpaid by $500.
Come on, Frank.
Let's return the suit.
This place is good.
It's small but, you know it's going to be a lot less work.
A lot less work for you.
Hey, Dad.
Hi.
Where's your mother?
I don't know.
She said something about going to look for a job.
What's she gonna be a shoe salesman at a centipede farm?
What are you doing?
You want some pancakes? For dinner?
On my son's 16th birthday?
We're not gonna eat pancakes.
Come on, why are you looking at me like that? You thought I forgot?
- I opened a checking account in your name.
I put $25 in the account so you can buy whatever you want.
Don't tell your mother. I won't.
Thanks, Dad.
Yep. Didn't that bank turn you down for a loan, though? Yes, they all turned me down.
(chuckles)
Then why you opening a banking account with them?
Well, because one day, you'll want something from these people...
a house, a car.
They have all the money.
There's 50 checks there, Frank which means, from this day on... you're in their little club.
I'm in their little club.
You got that, you got it all.
It's even got my name there, huh? To the moon.
- To the moon!
- To the moon.
See that?
It's just a school.
No different than Westbourne.
Ma... you said you were going to quit.
Frankie, you don't have to wear the uniform here.
Why don't you take off your jacket?
I'm used to it.
Excuse me. Oh, yes?
Do you know where room 17 French is?
Yeah, it's... (snickering)
Yeah, he looks like a substitute teacher.
Quiet down, people!
My name is Mr. Abagnale!
That's Abagnale, not Abagnahlee not Abagnaylee, but Abagnale!
Now, somebody please tell me where you left off in your textbooks.
Excuse me, people, if I need to ask again
I'm going to write up the entire class.
Take your seats!
Chapter seven.
Will you please open your textbooks to, uh, chapter eight and we'll get started?
Excuse me, what's your name? Brad.
Brad, why don't you get up here in front of the class here and read conversation number five?
(pronouncing poorly): "Les Francais sonts
"uh, generalement - "dans leur pais que...
- (students laughing)
Presque tout le monde a cette impression..." They sent for me.
They said they needed a sub for Roberta.
I came all the way from-from Dixon.
Well, uh, I always sub for Roberta.
Excuse me, why aren't you reading? (continues reading)
I'll never come back to-to Bellarmine Jefferson again! - You tell them not to call me!
- (students laughing)
What do they think, it's easy for a woman my age and all the money that it costs to travel?
(students laughing)
Mr. And Mrs. Abagnale this is not a question of your son's attendance.
I regret to inform you that, for the past week
Frank has been teaching Mrs. Glasser's French class.
He what?
Your son has been pretending to be a substitute teacher lecturing the students, uh, giving out homework.
Mrs. Glasser has been ill and there was some confusion with the real sub.
Your son held a teacher-parent conference yesterday and was planning a class field trip to a French bread factory in Trenton.
Do you see the problem we have? - Mrs. Davenport?
- Yeah.
Uh, I have a note to miss fifth and sixth period today. Doctor's appointment.
- One moment.
- (phone ringing) I'll be right with you.
(whispering):
Hey... MRS. DAVENPORT:
Yes?
You should fold it.
What?
That note.
It's a fake, right?
You should fold it.
It's...
It's a note from my mom.
I have a doctor's appointment.
Yeah, but there's no crease in the paper.
When your mom hands you a note to miss school the first thing you do is, you fold it and you put it in your pocket.
I mean, if it's real, where's the crease?
(quietly): Frankie.
Ma, I'm home.
Oh, you remember that girl Joanna
I was telling you about?
I asked her out today.
Think we're going to go to the Junior Prom.
Ma, is this my driver's license?
That's all there is, two bedrooms.
Oh, Frankie.
You remember Dad's friend?
Jack Barnes? From the club.
Hello.
He came by looking for your father.
I was giving him a tour of the apartment.
It's very, uh, uh, spacious, Paula.
Dad's at the store. So, Frank...
you're getting to look more like your old man every day.
Thanks for the sandwich, Paula.
I'll see you later, eh?
Wait.
Is this yours? Oh. Well, thanks, Frank.
Uh, that's the President's pin.
I'd be in deep trouble if I lost that.
I'll see you all later, eh?
Are you hungry, Frankie?
I'll make you a sandwich.
Jack wanted to talk business with your father.
He thinks we should get a lawyer and sue the government.
That is not legal, what they're doing to us.
Why aren't you saying anything?
You're not going to tell him... are you?
(quietly):
No. That's right.
There's nothing to tell.
I'm going out for a few hours to visit some old friends from the tennis club and... when I get home, we'll all have dinner together.
Right?
But you won't say anything because it's...
it's just silly, isn't it?
How could we sue anybody?
Oh... do you need some money, Frankie?
A few dollars to buy some record albums?
Here, take five dollars.
Or-Or ten.
You promised you were going to quit.
Ma, I'm home!
Hey, hey! You...
You stay away from me, hear me?
You stay away from me...
I don't know who you are but if you ever come back here again...
Frankie!
Frank, Frank, calm down, will you?
I'm Dick Kesner.
Now, I want you to leave your things here and follow me into the next room, okay?
They're all waiting for you.
You don't have to be scared. I'm right here, Frank.
I'll always be here.
But there are laws.
Everything in this country has to be legal.
So what we need to do is make some decisions.
That's what Mr. Kesner is here for.
Many times these decisions are left up to the courts but that can be very expensive, Frank people fighting over their children.
Nobody is fighting.
Look at me, Frank. Nobody is fighting.
(speaking French)
(quietly): Dad, what's going on?
Dad, what's going on?
Do you remember your grandma, Eve?
She arrived this morning. (speaks French)
Hello.
Do you understand what we're saying to you, Frank?
Your father and I are getting a divorce.
Nothing's gonna change.
We're still gonna see each other. Stop it, please, Frank.
Don't interrupt.
Frank, you don't have to read all of this.
Most of it's for your parents...
boring adult business... but this paragraph right here, this is important because it states who you're gonna live with... after the divorce... whose custody you will be in.
And there's a blank space right here.
And I want you to go into the kitchen sit at the table and put a name down.
You can take as long as you want but when you come back into this room...
I want to see a name on that line.
Frank, just write down a name and this will all be over.
It's gonna be okay. FRANK:
Dad, what name? Your mother or your father.
Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.
And don't look so scared.
It's not a test.
There"s no wrong answer.
Hi. (panting)
One ticket to Grand Central, please.
That'll be $3.50, sir.
Is it okay if I write you a check?
Carl, when do I get to call my father?
You can call him when we get to New York.
We leave for the airport in seven hours.
Until then, just sit there.
Be quiet.
You know, Carl, on the other side of the hotel they got suites that face the park.
It's the best room the FBI can afford.
It's okay, I've stayed in worse.
Mr. Mudrick...
Mr. Mudrick, please.
You have to listen.
I don't want to hear your story.
This is two checks that bounced.
You know how much trouble I'm in?
No, but listen, I'm telling you, the bank, they made the mistake.
I'll write you another check right now!
What, do I look like I was born yesterday?
Look, it's midnight, Mr. Mudrick.
Where am I gonna go?
You're a goddamn kid.
Go home.
I mean, I hope you understand.
My boss sent me to Brooklyn, then Queens.
Now he wants me in Long Island to take a few clients out for a night on the town.
I'm sorry, but we're not allowed to cash checks from other banks.
How would we know if they were any good?
What did you say your name was? Ashley.
Ashley... you know what I found on the sidewalk out there?
Must've slipped right off your neck.
Is there something I can help you with, son?
Well, you see, it's my grandmother's birthday next week and I want to get her something extra-special.
Please, I mean it's my midterm next week and my books were stolen.
Please, it's just five dollars.
No one would have to know.
I'm sorry, but we are not allowed to take checks from people we don't know.
Pleasure to have you back, Captain Carlson. What do you think, Angelo?
The tomatoes are ripe this afternoon.
Well, what have we here? - Can I have your autograph?
- You betcha.
- Can I have your autograph, too?
- You gonna be a pilot?
- Mm-hmm!
- All right, then.
Work hard in school.
FRANK:
Dear Dad:
I have decided to become an airline pilot.
I have applied to all the big airlines and I have several promising interviews lined up.
How"s Mom?
Have you called her lately?
Love, your son, Frank.
Hello.
I'm Frank Black from Murrow High School and I have an appointment with Mr. Morgan.
You're the young man who's writing the article for the school paper.
Yes, ma'am, that's me.
I want to know everything there is to know about being a pilot.
What airports does Pan Am fly to?
What does a pilot make in a year?
And who tells them where they're gonna fly to? Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.
Just take 'em one at a time.
All right.
What does it mean when one pilot says to another pilot:
"What kind of equipment are you on?"
They just want to know what kind of aircraft you're flying: Is it a DC-8, 707, Constellation?
And what about those I.D. Badges that I've seen pilots wear?
Well, every pilot has to have two things with him at all times:
One is his airline personnel badge... looks just like this one here, from Pan Am... the other one is their FAA license... and that looks just like this.
Oh.
Sir, do you think I can make a copy of this to put into my article?
Oh, Frank, you can have that one. It's three years expired.
Aw, thanks!
And what about your I.D. Badge?
You have an extra one I could borrow?
Oh, no, I can't help you there.
Those are special-ordered from Polaroid.
The only way to get one of those is to become a real live pilot for Pan American Airways.
WOMAN (over phone): Pan Am, may I help you? FRANK (Southern accent):
Yeah, hello.
I'm calling about a uniform.
WOMAN:
Hold for Purchasing. FRANK: Thank you.
WOMAN 2:
Purchasing. FRANK (Southern accent):
I'm a copilot based out of San Francisco.
I flew a flight into New York last night but the problem is
I'm headed out to, uh, Paris in three hours.
How can we help you? FRANK:
I sent my uniform to be cleaned through the hotel and I...
I guess they must have lost it.
They lost a uniform. Happens all the time.
Go down to the Well-Built Uniform Company at Ninth and Broadway.
They"re our uniform supplier.
L"ll tell Mr. Rosen you"re coming.
ROSEN:
You look too young to be a pilot.
I'm a copilot.
Why so nervous?
How would you feel if you, uh lost your uniform first week on the job?
Relax.
Pan Am's got lots of uniforms.
It's gonna be $164. Great.
I'II, uh, I'll write you a check.
Sorry, no checks, no cash.
You'll have to fill in your employee I.D. Number and then I'll bill Pan Am.
They'll take it out of your next paycheck.
Even better.
FRANK: Dear Dad:
You always told me that an honest man has nothing to fear.
So I"m trying my best not to be afraid.
L"m sorry I ran away, but you don"t have to worry. L"m gonna get it all back now, Daddy.
I promise.
L"m going to get it all back.
(approving murmur)
Are you a real live pilot? I sure am, little lady.
What's your name?
Celine.
Celine, it's a pleasure to meet you.
It's a pleasure to meet you, too.
That's fifty, seventy eighty, ninety, one hundred dollars.
You have yourself a great time in Paris.
I always do.
Excuse me. I'm John Modiger.
I manage this branch.
I want to thank you for coming in and using our institution.
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, John. I'll be back again.
Good.
Have you stayed with us before?
Uh, no, I've been primarily based on the West Coast.
Is it all right if I write you a check for the room? No problem, sir.
Great.
Uh...
I was also wondering if I could write you a personal check?
For airline personnel, we cash personal checks up to $100.
Payroll checks we cash up to $300.
Did you say $300 for a payroll check?
FRANK: Dear Dad:
L"ve decided to become a pilot for Pan American Airways... the most trusted name in the skies.
They"ve accepted me into their training program and told me that if I work hard
I should earn my wings real soon.
Please get in touch with Joanna Carlton from the tenth grade.
Tell her I"m sorry that I could not take her to the Junior Prom.
Love, your son, Frank.
Hello, how are you? Fine, thank you.
I have a payroll check here I'd like to cash.
Certainly. Thank you.
Uh, excuse me.
I'm sure you hear this all the time but you have the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen.
Yeah, I do get that all the time.
How would you like it?
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
We won't have any cash until the banks open in an hour but, uh, I'm sure they can cash your check at the airport.
The airport?
Who cashes checks at the airport? Well, the airlines, sir.
They've always taken care of their own.
Hello. Hi.
Are you deadheading?
What?
Are you my deadhead to Miami?
Mi...?
Yes, yes.
(laughs)
Yeah, I'm the deadhead. Here you go.
You're a little late, but the jump seat is open.
You know it's been awhile since I've done this.
Which one's the jump seat again?
Have a nice flight.
Are you my deadhead?
Frank, Captain Oliver. - John Larkin, the copilot.
- Hello. Fred Tulley, flight engineer.
Frank Taylor, Pan Am.
Thanks for giving me a lift, boys.
Go ahead and take a seat, Frank. We're about to push.
What kind of equipment you on, DC-8?
Uh, 707.
You turning around on the redeye?
Uh, I'm jumping puddles for the next few months trying to earn my keep running leapfrogs for the weak and weary.
No shame in that.
We all did it.
Have a seat. Thank you.
Would you like a drink after takeoff?
M-Milk?
OLIVER:
80 knots. LARKIN:
Check. V-one.
Rotate.
(jet engines roaring)
Positive rate.
Gear up. FRANK:
Dear Dad: Today was graduation.
I am now a copilot earning $1,400 a month plus benefits and the best part is they tell me my family can fly for free.
So tell Mom to pack her bags and buy a new swimsuit because I"m taking us all to Hawaii for Christmas.
I love you, Dad.
Aloha, Frank.
Hello, deadhead. Hello.
Enjoying your free ride?
Marci... did you drop this?
Must've slipped right off your neck.
No... (chuckling)
(giggling): No!
No... MARCl:
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Yes!
Why are you stopping?
I want to tell you something, Marci.
This is by far... the best date I have ever been on.
(laughing) D d WOMAN:
Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank.
How may I help you?
My name is Frank Taylor.
I'm a copilot for Pan Am.
I'd like to cash this check here, and then
I'd like to take you out for a steak dinner.
And then we feed the checks into the MICR machine which uses special ink to encode the account numbers on the bottom of the checks.
And where are these numbers?
They're, um... right here.
Right there?
See?
(both giggling)
They're called routing numbers.
So where do the checks get routed to?
You know, I don't exactly know.
Nobody ever asked me that before.
Our next item up for bid is also from the Jersey Central Bank foreclosure.
This is a MICR encoder a machine used to encode bank checks.
Do I have an opening bid? HANRATTY:
Our unknown subject is a paperhanger who started working on the East Coast.
In the last few weeks, this unsub has developed a new form of check fraud which I"m calling "the float."
What he's doing is he's opening checking accounts at various banks then changing the MICR ink routing numbers at the bottom of those checks.
Next slide, please.
(projector clanks)
Next slide, please. Uh, the remote thing is broken.
You'll have to do it by hand.
You've gotta... try the...
Agent Mullen, it should be... it should be the square button just there by the side.
This carousel doesn't work. It's a bad carousel you got there.
Thank you, Agent Mullen.
Got to move it manually.
This is a map of the 12 banks of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Slide. (clicking)
MICR scanners at every bank read these numbers at the bottom of a check... slide... and then, ship that check off to its corresponding branch.
Carl, for those of us who are unfamiliar with bank fraud you mind telling us what the hell you're talking about?
The East Coast branches are numbered zero-one to zero-six.
The central branch is zero-seven, zero-eight so on, so forth.
You mean those numbers on the bottom of a check actually mean something?
All of this was in the report I filed two days ago.
If you change...
a zero-two to a one-two that means that check, which was cashed in New York does not go to the New York Federal Branch but it is rerouted all the way to the San Francisco Federal Branch.
The bank doesn't even know the check has bounced for two weeks which means our unsub can stay in one place paper the same city over and over again while his checks circle the country.
You know, you want to talk to my wife.
She's the one balances the checkbook at our house.
Next slide.
Daddy! (chuckling)
My son, the birdman. Some uniform, Frank.
What do you think?
Nice.
Sit down. (clears throat)
Daddy, have you gotten the postcards?
Of course.
This fork is ice cold.
No, no, Dad, th-that's a chilled salad fork. (whispering):
It's a fancy restaurant, you know.
Well, here... l-I got you something.
What's that?
Open it.
You know what those are, right?
Those are the keys to a 1(65 Cadillac DeVille convertible.
Brand-new, Dad.
Red with white interior split seats, air conditioning, the works.
Are you giving me a Cadillac? Yeah.
I'm giving you a Cadillac.
Dad, sh-she's parked downstairs.
When we're done eating lunch why don't you, you know, drive on over to Mom's house pick her up, take a little joyride?
Do you know what would happen if the IRS found out
I was driving around in a new coupe?
I took the train here, Frank.
I'm taking the train home.
All right.
I have plenty of money.
You know, if you ever, ever need anything... You worried?
About me?
I'm not worried.
You think I can't buy my own car?
Two mice fell in a bucket of cream, Frank.
Which one am I?
You're that second mouse.
I went by the store today.
I had to close the store for awhile. It's all about timing, Frank.
The goddamn government knows that.
They hit you when you're down.
I wasn't going to let them take it from me, so I just... shut the doors myself, called their bluff.
Sooner or later, they'll forget about me.
I understand, I...
Have you told Ma?
She's so stubborn, your mother.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to let her go without a fight.
I been fighting for us... (gasps quietly)
Dad?
...since the day we... we met.
Daddy, out of all those men you were the one that took her home, remember that.
200 men, sitting in that tiny social hall watching her dance.
What was the name of that town? Montrichard, Dad.
Yeah.
I didn't speak a word of French and six weeks later, she was my wi...
She's your wife.
My son bought me a Cadillac today.
I think that calls for a toast. (soft jazz playing)
To the best damn pilot in the sky.
It's not what you think.
I'm just a copilot.
You see these people staring at you?
These are the most powerful people in New York City and they keep peeking over their shoulders wondering where you're going tonight.
Where you going, Frank?
Dad, nobody's staring at me.
Some place exotic?
Just tell me where you're going.
Los An... Hollywood.
Hollywood.
The rest of us... really are suckers.
So, I got on this red dress and these high heels, right?
And I got a bra, like, out here, okay?
And I'm chasing these two Puerto Rican guys through the park.
They got a suitcase filled with bank robbery loot.
Okay, I'm screaming out, "FBI, freeze!"
And I'm reaching for my gun, but I can't find it in the bra. It's so damn big
I thought I was going to shoot my tits off.
You know, that's a funny story.
People always laugh at that story.
Let me ask you a question, Mr. Amdursky.
If you were having so much fun undercover why did you transfer to bank fraud?
I didn't transfer.
I was censured and reassigned.
It's like being punished.
I was punished.
I screwed up in the field.
What about you, Mr. Fox?
Were you... punished for screwing up in the field?
Oh, no, no, no, I've never worked in the field before.
I audited background investigations of Department of Justice clerical applicants.
Well, that's just great.
I ask for a team and they drag the bottom of the Pacific.
You mind if I ask you a question, Agent Hanratty?
How come you're so serious all the time?
Does it bother you, Mr. Amdursky?
Yeah.
Yeah, it does bother me.
Does it bother you, Mr. Fox?
A little, I guess.
Well, would you like to hear me tell a joke? Yeah.
Yeah, we'd love to hear a joke from you.
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
Go fuck yourselves.
He cashed three checks. They all cleared.
I was going to deposit this one today.
I don't want any trouble.
No trouble.
No trouble at all.
We'll just take this check and be on our way.
Thank you.
Good.
Because I don't want my customers harassed. D...
What are you saying, he's still here?
201. D...
Thank you.
Corner here.
Oh, thanks, son. D...
Some steps.
Steps.
Hey, Mr. Murphy, how are you?
Is that Frank?
Yeah, it's Frank.
Hey, Frank, how are you?
How's the knee?
Come on, I'll race you right now.
(chuckling):
Take care.
Okay, Frank. AMDURSKY:
"Eyeball the back"?
Come on, Carl, this guy's a pen and ink man. A goddamn paperhanger.
He doesn't even carry a gun.
Why can't we go with you, Carl?
You just keep your eyes open, do your job and I'll buy you both a Good Humor bar.
It's all right, ma'am. FBI.
(whimpers)
201... 201, 201.
201... 201... 201... 201... 201... (anxious breathing)
FBI!
FBI!
Come out of the bathroom!
Step out of the bathroom!
Hands on your head.
Oh, that's the new IBM Selectric.
Put your hands on your head.
You can change the print type in five seconds.
- Shut up! - Just pop out the ball.
Put your hands on your head!
Put your hands...!
You know, he's got over 200 checks here, a gallon
- of India ink, drafting.
- Hands on your head!
Even has little payroll envelopes addressed to himself from Pan Am.
Put it down!
Drop it!
Relax.
You're late, all right?
My name's Allen, Barry Allen
United States Secret Service.
Your boy just tried to jump out the window.
My partner has him in custody downstairs.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You think the FBI are the only ones on this guy?
I mean, come on.
Come on, he's dabbling in government checks here.
We've been following a paper trail on this guy for months now.
Hey, you mind taking that gun out of my face?
Please. Really.
I mean, it makes me nervous.
Let me see some credentials.
Yeah, sure. Take my whole wallet.
(clears throat)
You want my gun, too? Come over here.
Take my gun.
Hey, hey, look, just do me a favor.
Take a look outside. Look.
Look out the window.
My partner's walking him to the car as we speak...
Look.
Old guy almost pissed in his pants when I came through the door.
He jumped right through the window onto the hood of my car.
Hey, Murph?
- Call the LAPD again.
I don't want people walking through my crime scene.
I didn't expect the Secret Service on this. Don't worry about it.
(clears throat)
Well, what's your name?
Hanratty, Carl Hanratty.
Mind if I see some identification?
Sure.
You never can be too careful these days. Well, tough luck, Carl.
Five minutes earlier you would've landed yourself a pretty good collar.
It's all right.
Ten seconds later, and you'd have been shot.
Mind if I come downstairs with you?
L-I got to take a look at this guy.
Sure thing.
Just, uh, do me a favor and sit tight for a second while I get this evidence downstairs.
You know, I don't want some maid walking through here and making the bed.
LAPD should be here any sec.
Wait.
Your wallet.
You hang onto it for a minute.
I trust you.
Oh... (chuckling)
Yeah...
Secret Service.
Hey!
Oh, goddamn it!
It was stupid. I made a stupid mistake.
Forget about it.
There are hundreds of unknown subjects out there.
L-I can get this guy, Sean.
The worst thing a paperhanger can do is show his face.
I read the report.
Six feet tall, brown hair, 27 to 30 years of age 160 pounds.
This could be almost anybody.
I heard his voice, Sean, I saw his face.
There's nothing for him to hide behind anymore.
Just be careful.
You got 12 years in.
Nobody bothers you down on the first floor.
You practically wrote the book on bank fraud.
That's the kind of thing that can make you section chief someday.
Just don't put yourself in this type of position. What type of position?
Position of being humiliated.
Sean, would you like to hear me tell a joke?
Yeah, sure.
(pointedly): Knock, knock!
So, my-my next question is, when a pilot retires uh, Pan Am sends them a check every single month?
Uh, yeah, pension program sends a check and benefits.
How much is that check for?
Uh, kid, I'm really not in the mood for this right now.
This Skywayman's driving me crazy.
Who's the Skywayman?
Ah, some nut that's flying around the country posing as a Pan Am pilot.
There's a column about him in the paper today.
I keep telling them this is not my problem.
This guy doesn't even fly Pan Am. Flies everybody else.
Flies United, TWA, Continental, Eastern... (whispering):
The Skywayman.
Newspaper loves this clown.
They call him "the James Bond of the sky."
Did you say...?
Bond, James Bond.
Tell me, Joan, why does he do it?
He likes to win. MAN: Come on, come on.
WOMAN: We'll be landing in 20 minutes.
Do you want to play it easy or the hard way?
And this isn't a tranquilizer.
Well, Pussy, you do know a lot more about planes than guns. (imitating Sean Connery):
Hello, Pussy. (normal voice):
Now, you're sure this is the suit, right? Positive.
It's the exact suit he wore in the movie.
(Connery voice): Okay. I'll take three.
Certainly, Mr. Fleming.
Now what you need is one of those little foreign sports cars that he drives.
Hello. Hi.
D...
Haven't I seen you before? D...
Maybe.
A couple years ago, I was on the cover of Seventeen.
Yeah. You're that model, right?
Cheryl.
Yes.
The guys used to put your picture on their lockers.
Isn't that your silver car I saw parked out front?
Yeah. One of them.
So, think I could get an autograph? D...
Do you have a pen in your room? D...
Shh. D...
Man like you can buy anything he wants. Let this be just the start d d Of so many nights like this... d
He buys a deck of cards at the hotel gift shop. D...
Well, you want to see a card trick? D...
How much did these cards cost? D...
Oh, 55 cents, I think. D...
And if they sold me downstairs at the hotel gift shop... how much would you pay?
I'm sor...
I'm sorry, how mu...
how much would I pay for what?
The entire night.
How much would you pay me for the entire night?
Cheryl, I... I really don't know.
D...
Don't be scared. D...
Make me an offer. Now that I have found you d d Don't ever go... d
$300?
Go fish.
Uh, $500?
Go fish. (chuckles)
$600. (both chuckling)
Go fish.
$1,000.
Okay.
$1,000.
Okay.
I'll be right back. Wait a second.
Where are you going?
I'm going downstairs to cash a check.
You think this hotel is going to cash a $1,000 check at 3:00am?
It's a New York Savings and Loan check. It's like gold.
They'll cash it.
Don't you think they might get a little suspicious?
Let me see that.
It's a cashier's check.
Endorse it over to me. No.
I couldn't do that.
See, this check is for $1,400.
We agreed upon $1,000.
Why don't I give you back $400 and you give me that check?
Even better.
Does this belong to anybody?
This is Hanratty. Merry Christmas.
FRANK:
Hello, Carl.
Hello.
Barry Allen, Secret Service.
I've been trying to track you down now for the last couple of hours.
What do you want?
I wanted to apologize for what happened out in Los Angeles.
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
No, no, you don't apologize to me.
Do you always work on Christmas Eve, Carl?
I volunteered so men with families could go home early.
Looked like you were wearing a wedding ring out in Los Angeles.
I thought maybe you had a family.
No.
No family.
You want to talk to me... let's talk face-to-face.
All right.
I'm at my suite at the Stuyvesant Arms, room 3113.
In the morning, I leave for Las Vegas for the weekend.
You think you're going to get me again?
You're not going to Vegas.
You're not in the Stuyvesant Arms.
You'd love for me to send out 20 agents Christmas Eve we barge into your hotel, knock down the door so you can make fools out of us all.
I'm really sorry if I made a fool out of you.
I really am. Uh-uh, no.
No, listen, I really am.
No, no, you-you do not feel sorry for me.
The truth is, I knew it was you.
Now maybe I didn't get the cuffs on you, but I knew.
Ah, people only know what you tell them, Carl.
Well, then tell me this, Barry Allen, Secret Service.
How did you know I wouldn't look in your wallet?
The same reason the Yankees always win.
Nobody can keep their eyes off the pinstripes.
The Yankees win because they have Mickey Mantle.
No one ever bets on the uniform. (Frank chuckles)
You sure about that, Carl?
I'll tell you what I am sure of.
You're going to get caught.
One way or another, it's a mathematical fact. It's-It's like Vegas.
The House always wins.
Well, Carl, I'm sorry, but I have to go. Ah.
You didn't call just to apologize, did you?
What do you mean? You... you...
you have no one else to call.
Oh, ho, ho.
You got that burger up? Yep.
("He"s So Fine" playing on radio)
How are you? Doo-lang, doo-lang, doo-lang... d d The one with the wavy hair... d
More coffee, sir?
Are you a collector? Of what?
"Captives of the Cosmic Ray," "The Big Freeze"
"Land of the Golden Giants." I've got them all.
What are you talking about?
Barry Allen.
The Flash.
Wait, kid, kid, kid.
You mean like the comic book? Yeah, the comic book.
When he's not The Flash.
That's his name, Barry Allen.
Thank you.
Now get this: He reads comic books.
Comic books!
Barry Allen is The Flash!
FOX: Carl, slow down.
Slow down. I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
He's a kid.
Our unsub is a kid.
That's why we couldn't match his prints.
That's why he doesn't have a record.
Now, I want you to contact NYPD for every all-points juvenile runaways in New York City.
And don't forget the airports.
He's been kiting checks all over the country. But why New York?
The Yankees!
He said something about the Yankees!
HANRATTY:
So where are we on the list?
(rings doorbell) FOX:
Number 53, "Abagnahlee."
Good morning, ma'am.
We're the FBI agents who called.
Yes, I've been waiting.
I hope you're all hungry.
I put out the Sara Lee.
My husband Jack is a lawyer.
What about your first husband, Mrs. "Abagnahlee"?
Abagnale, but I prefer to be called Barnes.
"Frank William Abagnale."
It says here he was in the service. Did...
Did you two meet during the war?
Yeah, I lived in a very small village in France...
Montrichard...
the kind of place where they never heard of Sara Lee.
Help yourselves.
"Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee."
You filled out a missing person's report for a runaway juvenile by the name of Frank Abagnale Jr.
Is Frankie okay?
You're aware of the fact that he wrote some checks on a closed account at Chase Manhattan Bank?
Oh, yes.
The police think he's some type of criminal.
What he did was a felony, Mrs. Barnes.
It was $1,000.
Half the kids his age are on dope throwing rocks at police and they scared me to death because my son made a little mistake.
Huh.
A 17-year-old...
boy has to eat has to have a place to sleep.
We understand, ma'am.
Would you happen to have a picture of your son? Oh, yes.
I have his old yearbook.
Okay.
Okay, okay, we, uh... we need to send out an all-office teletype.
Our unsub's name is Frank Abagnale Jr., age 17.
Is Frankie okay?
Is he in trouble?
Ma'am, I'm sorry to have to tell you:
Your son is forging checks. Forging checks?
Wait!
I'm sure we can take care of that.
I am working part-time at the church now.
Just tell me how much he owes and I'll pay you back.
So far, it's about $1.3 million.
Hi, Melanie, how are you?
When you're in the house, please, just use an ashtray.
Frank, this fondue is so good!
Here, take this for me. Ooh, good!
I love Moet!
D Oh, yeah... d
How are you?
D You really got me goin' d d You got me goin', got me goin' and goin'... d
James, James, please!
Just stay away from the hi-fi system, all right? It's reel-to-reel.
You can't wind it like that.
Christ! Terry!
This is Italian knit!
Watch where you're going!
It's just a shirt, man!
Frank!
Come quick!
Lance just fell into the conversation pit!
Excuse me, you know where Lance Applebaum is?
Thank you. DOCTOR:
These bottles need to be labeled when you pick them up.
Do you understand how dangerous this is?
Do you?
Don't stand there crying, just nod your head and tell me you won't do it again.
Now dry up and get back to work.
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Blair, Dr. Blair
Dr. Sherwood Blair.
(gently):
Hey, hey... you okay?
(sniffling): He told me to pick up the blood, so I did, but he never told me to label it.
Hey, it's okay.
Stop crying.
What's your name? - Brenda.
- Brenda.
Brenda, I wouldn't worry about it.
You know, these doctors you know, they don't know everything.
It's my first week and I think they're going to fire me.
No, no, nobody's going to fire you, Brenda.
I bet you're good at your job.
No, I'm not.
Yeah, I bet if I asked you to check on the status of my friend Lance Applebaum that you could do that for me in a second.
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery.
Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery. Um...
Mr. Applebaum fractured his ankle.
Dr. Ashland is treating him in exam room seven.
You see that?
No problem.
This is the emergency chart.
See that blue star there?
That means that the patient has been diagnosed.
And then, after he's been treated we put a red circle here, see?
How do you like those braces?
I guess they're all right.
I got mine off last year. Boy, I hated them.
They were bottoms.
You know, I still got to wear my mouth guard.
You have really nice teeth.
Well, thank you.
And you have a pretty smile. WOMAN (over P.A.): Custodial to cafeteria.
I really think those braces look good on you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Brenda. Yeah.
Do you know if they're hiring here at the hospital?
I'm not sure.
What do you want to do?
I'm a doctor.
FRANK: Dear Dad:
L"ve decided to get off the road for awhile.
L"ve taken a night job at a hospital and met some really nice people.
Feels good to have my feet on the ground to wake up in the same bed every night.
Who knows, maybe I"ll even find someone to settle down with.
Harvard Medical School... top of your class.
Southern California Children's Hospital.
Well, that's a pretty impressive resume, Dr. Conners but unfortunately, uh...
the only thing I need is a...
an emergency room supervisor for my midnight to 8:00am shift someone to baby-sit six interns and 20 nurses but, uh...
Hell, I doubt that, uh, you would be interested in that.
Well, in the past they've always let me choose my own nurses.
Dr. Connelly?
Dr. Harris?
Present.
Dr. Ashland?
Dr. Conners...
You gonna take roll every night?
Uh, yes, I will, Dr. Ashland and if you're going to be late, I suggest you bring a note.
(snickering)
Miss Basmann.
Miss Mace.
Miss Strong. Here.
Nurse Brown.
- Nurse Sanford? - Here.
SURGEON (on TV):
30 milligrams of codeine every four hours.
Run the plasma at 60 drops a minute until we calculate the fluid requirements.
What do you estimate the degree and extent of the burns, Kildare?
DR. KILDARE:
Second and third-degree burns over about 20 percent of the body surface.
Do you concur?
I concur.
Let's get him up to Pediatrics.
WOMAN (over P.A.): Nurse Hopp to the Nurses' Station South.
Nurse Hopp to the Nurses' Station South. Hello, Brenda.
Hi, Dr. Conners.
You need to sign these.
Thank you.
Do you notice anything different about me, Doctor? - You got your braces off!
- Yeah!
Come here.
Let me see.
I've been trying to show you all night!
Wow.
Good job.
Yeah? So, did it hurt when they took them off?
Mine felt so weird after.
Mm, I keep rubbing my tongue over them.
I can't stop.
They're so slippery.
It feels good, though, doesn't it?
Yeah, it feels incredible.
Oh, my. I'm...
I'm sorry.
(thunder crashes)
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Conners to the ER.
Dr. Conners to the ER.
Shouldn't you go? No.
No, no.
They have a staff doctor in the emergency ward.
We'll be fine.
(panting): What if he's in surgery?
Do you really think I have to go? Oh.
In here, Dr. Conners.
(child sobbing)
Gentlemen, what, uh...
what seems to be the problem? Bicycle accident.
Fractured tibia about five inches below the patella.
Hmm.
- Dr. Harris.
- Yes?
Do you concur?
C...
Concur with what, sir?
With what Dr. Ashland just said.
Do you...
Do you concur?
Uh... well, it was a bicycle accident.
Um, the boy told us.
So you concur? Concur?
Uh...
I think we should take an X ray then stitch him up and put him in a walking cast.
That's very good, Dr. Ashland.
Very good.
Well, you don't seem to have much need for me.
Carry on.
I blew it, didn't I?
Why didn't I concur?
Frank Abagnale Sr.
You're not a cop.
Special Agent Hanratty, FBI. You're not a cop.
My landlord said you were not a cop.
Well, if you're going to arrest me
I'd like to put on a different suit if that's okay with you.
No, no, I'm not here to arrest you.
I'm looking for your son. He's in trouble.
Do you know where he is?
If I tell you where he is will you promise not to tell his mother?
Sure.
Frank made up a fake I.D. And enlisted in the Marine Corps.
He's over in Vietnam right now.
That kid is halfway around the world crawling through the damn jungle fighting the Communists, so... (shuts refrigerator door)
Please, don't come to my home and call my boy a criminal because that kid has more guts...
I never said he was a criminal, Mr. Abagnale.
I said he was in trouble.
If you'd like to give me a call and talk, here's my number.
You're not a father, are you?
Pardon me? If you were a father, you'd know.
I would never give up my son.
I would never give up my son. Yes, sir.
I understand.
Sean, Sean, now get this:
"Riverbend Apartments 415 Landover, Atlanta, Georgia."
Atlanta, Georgia.
Yeah, I'm on my way to the airport.
I'll meet the team in, uh, in four hours.
Bye-bye.
Come on, it's okay.
You don't have to cry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Frank.
I can't do this.
Brenda, listen to me.
I don't care if you're a virgin, all right? Really, I can wait.
I'm not a virgin.
I had an abortion two years ago.
My parents had a friend do it a man that my father plays golf with.
And then, when I got better, they kicked me out of the house.
I had an abortion and I wasn't their daughter anymore. (gently):
Hey... I'm so sorry.
Please don't be mad at me.
Please, please, don't be mad at me. No, no.
Please don't be mad at me.
Now... what if... what if I spoke to your parents, right?
May-Maybe I can straighten things out, huh?
Well, I ask them all the time but they said I still can't come home.
And my daddy's... a lawyer.
Brenda... what if you were engaged to a doctor?
Will that change anything?
What?
What if I went to your parents... and I spoke to your father... and I asked permission to marry you?
It's empty. Nobody here.
Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?
Yes, l-I am a Lutheran, but, please, call me Frank.
Frank, would you like to say grace?
Unless you're not comfortable.
Absolutely.
Two little mice fell into a bucket of cream.
The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned but the second mouse, he struggled so hard that he eventually churned that cream into butter and he walked out.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Amen.
Oh, that was beautiful.
The mouse, he churned that cream into butter.
That's right. That's pretty good.
Thank you.
Frank, have you decided which hospital you want to work at here in New Orleans?
Well, um, to be quite honest
I'm thinking about getting back into law.
Oh, my!
Are you a doctor or a lawyer?
Before I went to medical school, I passed the bar in California.
I practiced law for one year then I decided why not try my hand at pediatrics?
You're just full of surprises.
Yeah.
MOTHER (laughing): Oh, my.
A doctor and a lawyer.
Well, I'd say that Brenda hit the jackpot.
Where did you go to law school?
Uh, Berkeley. (gasping)
Berkley, Berkley. Oh, my gosh.
Isn't that where you went, Daddy?
Maybe Frank could come work for you, Roger.
You're always saying how hard it is to find Assistant Prosecutors.
Could he, Daddy? Could he, please?
Could he come work with you, please?
Was that snake Hollingsworth still teaching there when you went through Berkley?
(laughs quietly)
Hollingsworth. Yes.
Grumpy old Hollingsworth, right?
Meaner than ever.
And that dog of his?
Tell me, Frank, what was the name of his little dog?
I'm sorry.
Uh...
The dog was dead.
How unfortunate.
Yeah.
A doctor, a lawyer, a Lutheran...
So what are you, Frank?
'Cause I think you're about to ask for my daughter's hand in marriage and I have a right to know.
Know what, sir?
The truth.
Tell me the truth, Frank.
What are you doing here?
What is a man like you doing with Brenda?
If you want my blessing if you want my daughter
I'd like to hear it from you now.
The truth is, sir, that...
The truth is that...
I'm not a doctor, I'm not a lawyer...
I'm not an airline pilot. I'm...
I'm nothing, really.
I'm-I'm-I'm just a kid who's in love with your daughter.
No.
You know what you are?
You're a romantic.
Men like us are nothing without the women we love.
I must confess, I'm guilty of the same foolish whimsy.
I proposed to Carol after five dates with two nickels in my pockets and holes in my shoes because I knew she was the one.
So go ahead, Frank.
Don't be afraid.
Ask the question you came here to ask me.
Sir, uh, uh... w-what would I have to do to take the bar here in New Orleans?
No, the... the other question.
WOMAN: Right through that door.
Good luck, Mr. Conners.
Thank you.
Hey, Frank... you know what I could never figure out?
How did you cheat on the bar exam in Louisiana? Why?
What's the difference?
Someone else took the test for you, didn't they?
Carl, I'm going to prison for a long time.
Seriously, what's the difference?
It's a simple question.
Are you going to eat that eclair?
Yeah.
I'm saving it for later.
Well, you want to split it with me?
No.
Give me half that eclair and I'll tell you.
I'm going to figure it out sooner or later.
You'll be working under Phillip Rigby in corporate law.
Why don't you settle in, organize your desk?
Thank you.
We're having lunch at 12:30 with the Attorney General and Governor McKeithen.
Himself. The Governor.
Did we spell it right?
You sure did.
Congratulations. Thank you, sir.
Welcome aboard.
Now...
Look at this photograph, Mr. Stewart.
It's a photograph of Prentice York where they found him, dead.
Now, here is an enlargement of part of that photograph.
This is a photograph of the defendant's signature on a canceled check.
Now, here is an enlargement of that same signature which matches the signature on the letters that he wrote to Mrs. Simon which discuss the possibility of defrauding the great State of Louisiana.
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury this is irrefutable evidence that the defendant is, in fact, lying.
(echoing thud)
Mr. Conners, this is a preliminary hearing.
There is no... defendant.
There is no... jury.
It's just me.
Son... what in the hell is wrong with you?
- (applause over TV) - Is that Mitch? Roger!
It's Mitch!
Oh, my, I lost all track of time.
As studio guests for the sing-along tonight we have the children's choir of St. Monica's Church in New York City.
Won't you join them and the gang in a few songs for the Irish?
Everybody!
D Has anybody here seen Kelly?
(whispers): Dad.
What are you doing here? I...
l-I came to see you.
What are you doing dressed like this? I took a job.
A government job.
You see what I'm doing?
Do you have a good lawyer?
I sort of am a lawyer now.
Look at this letter.
The IRS wants more. I had a deal with them:
Two penalties.
They ate the cake, now they want the crumbs.
I want to sue them.
Now they want the crumbs. They...
Here, sit down.
They're trying to scare me, intimidate me.
You know what? You know what?
I'll make them chase me... for the rest of their lives.
Hey, it's great to see you, Daddy.
Listen, sit down, I...
I want to show you something.
I came here to give you this.
It's an invitation to an engagement party.
Daddy, I'm getting married. Can you believe that?
I'm getting married.
You don't need to worry about anything now, Dad.
Listen, I'm getting a brand-new Cadillac.
I'm getting a $60,000 house.
I'm-I'm getting it all back.
All-All the jewelry, all the furs, everything, Dad.
Everything they took from us, I'm going to get it back.
Now... has Ma seen you dressed like this?
Yeah, she came to pick up some boxes.
That's okay, that's okay, you know why?
'Cause she... she's going to the wedding with us.
I'm going to get you a brand-new suit, Dad.
I'm getting you a brand-new suit.
One of those Manhattan Eagle, three-button, black pearl suits.
You'll look great.
Those are nice.
Yeah.
She won't see me.
Well, have you tried to call her?
Uh-uh.
Why don't... why don't you call her right now?
Dad, why don't you call her right now? Here.
Dad, just call her.
Call her for me.
You call her, and you tell her
I have two first-class tickets to go see her son's wedding...
Your mother's married now, to my friend Jack Barnes.
They have a house in Long Island. (whispering):
I had an FBI agent come see me.
You got their number, son.
The guy looked scared.
The United States government, champ, running for the hills. Pow!
To the moon!
Dad... it's over.
I'm going to stop now.
But y-you've...
They're never going to catch you, Frank. - Dad, she wouldn't do that.
- Why won't you sit down?
- Why would she do that to you?
- Come on, sit. Come on, sit with me.
Have a drink.
I'm your father.
Then ask me to stop.
(quietly): Then ask me to stop.
You can't stop.
Where are you going?
Come on, Frank, where are you going? Where are you going?
Where are you going tonight?
Someplace exotic? Where are you going tonight?
Tahiti, Hawaii?
This is Hanratty. FRANK:
Hello, Carl.
Merry Christmas.
How are you, Dr. Conners?
Carl, I haven't been Dr. Conners for months now.
(Hanratty sniffles, clears throat)
Well...
I'm sitting here in my office on Christmas Eve.
What do you want?
(sighs): Okay.
I want it to be over.
I want it to be over.
I'm getting married.
You know, I'm settling down.
You've stolen almost $4 million.
You think we can just call that a wedding present?
Nah, this isn't something you get to walk away from, Frank. I want to call a truce.
No truce.
You will be caught, you will go to prison.
Where did you think this was going?
Please leave me alone, Carl. Please?
I'm getting close, aren't I?
You're scared because I'm getting close.
I know you... you rented that car in Shreveport and you stayed in that hotel on Lake Charles.
You want to run, be my guest.
Your checks don't lie as well as you do.
Stop chasing me.
I can't stop.
It's my job.
It's okay, Carl.
I just thought I'd ask, you know?
Merry Christmas, huh?
I love my job.
All right... (clears throat)
Let's get every newspaper we can every newspaper in Louisiana for the last two months.
What are we looking for?
Engagement announcements, name of Conners. Conners?
Come on, Carl, the kid would've changed his name by now.
Mm-mm.
He can't change it.
She thinks he's Conners.
If he loses the name, he loses the girl.
- Congratulations. - You having a good time?
D...
- Oh. - Hi.
Oh, me too.
Thank you.
I'm going to, uh, the little boys' room.
- Okay.
Hurry back.
Good evening.
I'm Agent Hanratty with the FBI.
We'd like to have a few quiet words with your host, if possible.
MAN:
I'll get him.
Right over there, sir. - Hi, Roger.
How are you? - Hi, Vin.
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Roger Strong.
Carl Hanratty, FBI.
This is Agents Amdursky and Fox.
Sorry to crash your party, sir. Not at all.
What can I do for you?
If it's not too much trouble, I'd like to meet the groom.
Is there a problem? - (laughter)
- Frank! Frank!
Can you hold all these?
(whispering): Yeah. Come here.
They're checks.
They're from my dad's friends.
They're for us, so we can start a new life... Hey! What are you doing?
What's wrong?
We have to leave.
What? !
Brenda, you love me, right?
Yes.
I mean, you'd love me no matter what. Yes.
I mean, you'd love me whether I was sick or whether I was poor or even if I had a different name.
Frank, where'd you get all that money? Brenda, listen.
A name, right?
A name, it doesn't matter.
My name is Frank Conners, right? - That's who I am with you.
- Yes.
But-but we all have secrets.
You know, sometimes when I travel
I use the name Frank Taylor.
That-That's my secret.
- Frank Taylor? !
- Yeah, Frank Taylor, you know?
- Frank Black.
- Frank Black? !
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
Why are you saying all this?
Brenda, I don't want to lie to you anymore.
I'm not a doctor.
I never went to medical school.
I'm not a lawyer or a Harvard graduate or a Lutheran.
Brenda, I ran away from home a year and a half ago when I was 16.
Frank...
Frank?
You're not a Lutheran?
Brenda... you see all this money?
You see all this money?
I have more.
I have plenty more.
I have enough money to last us for the rest of our lives
- (gasps) - Look.
Frank, stop teasing me. You're Frank Conners.
You're Frank Conners, and you're 28 years old and... (whispering):
Brenda...
Why would you lie to me? - Brenda, Brenda...
- I want to know your name.
- Listen to me, Brenda.
- Tell me your name.
We can live anywhere we want but you have to trust me, Brenda.
- Do you trust me? - Yes.
- Do you love me, Brenda?
- Yes. - You love me?
- I love you.
Excuse me, Mother.
Honey, this is Mr. Hanratty.
My wife Carol.
- Oh, Mister...?
- Hanratty, ma'am.
- Ratty. - Yes.
Have you seen Frank or Brenda?
L-I think they went upstairs.
Frank... (whispers):
Okay, in two days, you're going to meet me at Miami International Airport, all right?
You're going to leave the house after your parents go to sleep. You're going to take a taxicab.
You give the taxi driver this money right here and you tell him to drive all through the night.
Brenda, you're going to leave at 10:00am. - 10:00am, all right?
- But... (scatting)
Which room, sir? In the corner.
You have to listen to me, all right?
The International Terminal in Miami, all right?
Okay, the International Terminal in Miami.
- No matter what...
- You're going to take a taxicab.
- I will take a taxi.
You're going to be there at 10:00am. I will be there at 10:00am, no matter what.
- In two days.
- Two days.
Two days, Brenda.
Two days.
In two days, I'll be there no matter what, at 10:00am.
Your attention... d d
(crying):
Frank, please!
Before you go, please tell me your name.
Please, tell me.

WOMAN (over P.A.):
National Airlines flight number 27, serving Fort Myers, Sarasota, Tampa and New York Kennedy, is now available at gate n...
Skycap, Gate 14. Skycap, Gate 14. Taxi!
Brenda.
AMDURSKY: This guy"s a no-show.
He must"ve got wise to us.
HANRATTY: Maybe he was tipped.
If he's not here today, he'll be tomorrow.
We'll get him before he leaves the country. He doesn't have a passport.
For the last six months, he's gone to Harvard and Berkeley.
I'm betting he can get a passport.
So we have all our men waiting for him here in Miami International.
He's used it before.
He knows the layout.
I talked to Miami police;
they've offered us 50 uniformed cops in two shifts of 25.
With our guys, that's almost 100 men in one airport.
Don't you think we should spread it around?
No, no, this is the exit point.
Well, how do you know he hasn't rented a car and driven to airports in New York, Atlanta?
Because I'm not in New York. I'm not in Atlanta.
Yes, this is, uh, Frank Roberts and I'm letting all the universities in the area know that Pan Am will be initiating a new recruiting program this year.
I'II, uh, be stopping by your campus tomorrow morning.
Thank you all very much for coming. At the end of the day
I'll be choosing eight young ladies to be a part of... (cheering and laughter) ...Pan Am's future stewardess flight crew program.
Now, these eight young ladies will accompany me on a two-month public relations tour through Europe.
They will discover firsthand what it takes to be a Pan American stewardess.
HANRATTY: Give me at least two men...
Nah, one man per every two counters.
- All right? Amdursky?
Yeah?
Make sure your uniforms are covering the sidewalk entrances and exits.
let's have, uh, periodic sweeps of the men's lav. You, here. What qualifies me to be a future stewardess?
Well, I think that I'm really friendly and I can really help out and, um, make people feel welcome on the plane and...
We'll be traveling at 6,000 miles per hour at an altitude of 300 feet.
Ilene Anderson.

Hi. Let's take off in the blue d d Once I get you up there d d Where the air is rarefied d
You see that blonde out front? I should have been a pilot.
Exactly.
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Mr. Carl Hanratty please pick up the courtesy telephone.
Hanratty.
AMDURSKY:
Carl, your walkie-talkie wasn't working.
There's a guy in a Pan Am uniform sitting in a white Coupe DeVille out in front of Terminal J.
That's the charter terminal. Can you get a look at his face?
He's got his pilot's cap on.
Carl, I think it's him!
Just say the words, and we'll beat the birds d d Down to Acapulco Bay... d
Watch out, watch out, watch out! D...
Out of the car, Frank.
Frank? !
Step out of the car!
Keep your hands where I can see 'em. Don't shoot me!
I'm just a driver.
A man paid me $100 to wear this uniform and pick someone up at the airport.
Who you picking up?
Hey!
South America, Australia
Singapore, Egypt.
The kid's gone completely out of control.
Why wasn't I called?
Nobody was called, sir. The banks didn't know what was happening till last week. That's impossible.
They didn't call 'cause it's not counterfeiting.
- It's something else. - Well, what is he doing?
He's making real checks, sir.
These are so perfect the airline didn't know the difference.
Last check was cashed in Madrid a week ago. My guess is he's still there.
We have to leave now, sir.
Today.
Go where?
Spain?
You want to go to Spain?
Well, eventually, he's got to go back to where the checks were printed.
I think that's why he's moving back through Europe.
Look at the map, sir. He's making a circle.
He's running out of checks.
I know it's a...
it's a long shot, sir but if we track him from Madrid, sir, we could still catch him.
I'm sorry, Carl, if you couldn't catch him here you're not going to catch him there.
But, sir, we're going to let him get away.
No, Carl, you let him get away.
A perfect one-16th all the way around.
Hmm!
Color separation is flawless.
There's no bleeding. Hmm.
Nobody does work like this in the States. Nobody but us.
HANRATTY:
Where was it printed?
(chuckling):
It was printed on a monster... A monster.
...a Heidelberg, an Istra...
Heidelberg.
...a dinosaur, four colors.
You can smell the weight.
Two tons, without the ink. (inhales, clears throat)
Where do they do printing like this?
Germany, Great Britain... France.
BOTH PRINTERS:
Frank's mother said the name of a village in France where they didn't have Sara Lee.
The village where she met Frank's father.
Oh, yeah, I don't remember, uh...
It started with an M. It was, uh, "Mont" something.
"Mont." Mr. Fox?
Uh, yes, yes.
Question: "You met your husband during the war?" Answer: "Yes, I lived in a small village in France.
Yeah, right.
"The kind of place where they never heard of Sara Lee."
Tell me you wrote down the name of the village, Mr. Fox.
Montrichard.
Carl? Carl!
Merry Christmas!
How is it that we're always talking on Christmas, Carl?
Every Christmas I'm talking to you!
Put your shirt on, Frank.
You're under arrest.
Hey, are you hungry?
Do you want some beans, Carl?
They got the best French beans here.
Here, give these a try. There's two dozen French police officers outside.
Carl, I gotta tell you, they're delicious.
They wanted to bring you in.
You want a bite?
But they needed the help of an American. Are you hungry?
You want a bite?
But I told them I wouldn't bring them to you unless I could put the cuffs on you myself.
Well, you have a gun? You have a gun?
- No gun?
- No.
No gun.
and you're telling me what?
There's, uh, there's uh... (chuckles)
There's two dozen French police officers out there right now on Christmas Eve?
That's what you're telling me?
Yeah.
(chuckling): All right, all right.
Well, there's no windows here.
I'm going to take a look out the front door. No!
No!
I told them I'd walk out first and give a signal.
Here, you can put these on yourself.
No, I can't do that!
I can't do that.
You know why?
(panting)
'Cause I think you're full of shit. I don't...
I don't think there's anyone else out there.
I think it's just me and you.
That's right.
I think it's just me and you, and you know what?
You're going to have to catch me yourself!
I wo... we don't have time for this.
Ah, that's good.
That's good.
Tell me what you want me to see, huh? I wouldn't lie to you.
Look, you're wearing a wedding ring.
You're wearing a wedding ring, Carl! You lied to me about that!
Didn't you lie about that?
You asked me if I had a family.
I did, but I don't anymore.
No, no, no, there is no problem.
We're coming out right now.
Whoa, that was good. That was good.
What, did you...
you pay some hotel desk clerk to make that call for you, is that what you did?
It was Captain Luc.
I've got one minute to bring you out.
Captain Luc?
Captain Luc!
Ooh, Captain Luc.
Well, Carl, I gotta say that-that sounds pretty official to me but like I said, I...
I think it's just me and you here, it's me and you.
So you're going to have to catch me. Frank.
Frank!
You have to trust me on this!
These people have been embarrassed, Frank. They're angry.
You rob their banks, you steal their money you live in their country.
I told you this was what was going to happen that there was no other way for it to end.
Don't make a mistake! That's good.
That's good, Carl, you know?
Keep pushing that lie. Keep pushing it.
Keep pushing till you make it true.
They're going to kill you!
You walk out that door, they're going to kill you.
Is that the truth?
Yeah.
You have any children, Carl?
I have a four-year-old daughter.
You swear on your daughter?
You swear?
You swear?
That was really good, Carl.
I have him in custody. I got him.
I got him!
It's all right!
(shouting continues)
It's all right!
I got him! (speaking in French)
Hey, I want it... I want it on the record.
Frank Abagnale surrendered of his own accord.
Understood? Understood?
Where are you taking him?
(speaking in French)
I'm supposed to go.
Where are you taking him?
Let me in the... Let me in the car!
(shouting continues)
Let me in the car!
Don't worry, Frank!
I'll have you extradited back to the United States. Don't worry.
(siren wailing)
D Gloria d d In excelsius Deo. D Carl...
Carl, you have to remember to let me call my father when we land.
I just want to, I want to talk to him before he sees me on television or something like that.
Carl, look.
That's LaGuardia right there.
Runway 4-4.
Frank, your father is dead.
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to say anything till we got closer to home.
He-He...
He fell down some steps at Grand Central Station trying to catch a train.
I didn't want to be the one to tell you.
You're lying, right?
You said I could talk to him.
Carl, who are you to... who are you to say something like that, huh?
Who are you to say something like that?
You said I could talk to him.
He fell, and he...
and he broke his neck.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
(sobbing): Goddamn it!
Carl, I'm going to be sick!
- (people muttering) - It's all right. It's all right.
It's okay.
Carl, I got to go to the bathroom.
I'm going to be sick.
Sure.
Let's go in the bathroom.
Goddamn it!
(whispering): Oh, Daddy...
You'll have take your seat, sir. I've told you twice.
We're landing.
- Sorry. Thank you...
- All of you.
Frank!
Come on now.
- Frank?
- We're landing in six minutes.
All of you need to be in your seats
- with your seat belts fastened. - Frank, open the door!
Frank!
- You do it. - Yeah.
Frank! Frank!
(engines roaring)
All right, remain seated, everyone, please.
Stay seated. FBI.
Stay seated.
(engines whining)
- Please remain seated! - Stay seated.
STEWARDESS:
You must stay seated until the aircraft has come to a complete stop.
God almighty.
NAT KING COLE:
What's your name? (blows note)
Where's your mommy? D...
Hands behind your head! D...
Carl, get me in the car, please.
Get me in the car. HANRATTY:
Put him in.
(piano playing interlude in "The Christmas Song")
Taking into account the gravity of these crimes your history of bold and elusive behavior and your complete lack of respect for the laws of the United States
I have no choice but to ignore your request to be treated as a minor and sentence you to 12 years in Atlanta"s maximum security prison and recommend strongly that you be kept in isolation for the entirety of that sentence.
D..."Merry Christmas to you." d (song ends with guitar playing "Jingle Bells" riff) Use that door over there.
Hey, I got you some comic books here.
How's your daughter? What was her name?
Grace.
Well...
I don't know.
She lives with her mother in Chicago and I don't get to see her much.
What's in the briefcase? Oh.
I'm on my way to the airport.
It's a paperhanger who's working his way through Minnesota.
Aw, geez, he's... he's driving us crazy.
You got any of the checks? Yeah, yeah, I got a...
a counterfeit that he drew on the Great Lakes Savings and Loan.
See, he's just using a stencil machine and an Underwood.
Yeah, it's a teller at the bank. Say again?
L-It's definitely a teller, Carl.
I mean, banks, they always use hand-stamps for the dates, see.
They get used over and over again so they always get worn out and the numbers are always cracking.
The sixes and the nines...
see, they go first.
Thanks.
L"d like you to take a look at something for me.
Tell me what you think.
That's a fake.
How do you know? You haven't looked at it.
Well, there's no perforated edge, right?
I mean, this... this check was hand-cut, not fed.
Yeah...
Paper is double-bonded much too heavy to be a bank check.
Magnetic ink, it's, uh, raised against my fingers instead of flat.
(sniffing)
And this doesn't smell like MICR.
It's some kind of a... you know, some kind of a drafting ink.
You know, the kind you get at a stationery store. (clears throat)
Frank... would you be interested in working with the FBI's Financial Crimes Unit?
I already got a job here. You know, I, uh, deliver the mail.
Frank, we have the power to take you out of prison.
You'd be placed in the custody of the FBI where you'd serve out the remainder of your sentence as an employee of the federal government.
Under whose custody?
L-I'm Frank Abagnale.
I'm supposed to start work here today.
It's a tour company operating out of the BVI.
Sir, Mr. Abagnale is here.
I'm going to call you back.
Hello, Carl.
Welcome to the FBI.
I'll show you where you're working.
Carl... how long do I have to work here?
It's 8:15 in the morning to 5:00 in the afternoon.
45 minutes for lunch.
No, I...
I mean, how long?
Every day.
Every day, Frank, till we let you go.
- (tapping) - Yeah.
- Hey, Carl. - Hi.
How you doing?
It's not a good time, Frank.
I'm clearing my desk for the weekend.
Carl, you mind if I come to work with you tomorrow?
Tomorrow is Saturday.
I'm flying to Chicago to see my daughter.
I'll be back to work on Monday. You're going to see Grace, huh?
Well, that's the plan.
So what should I do till Monday?
I'm sorry, kid, I can't help you there.
Excuse me.
This is Hanratty.
Oh, yeah, put him on.
Mr. Sawyer.
How are you?
I have a half a dozen more checks on that tour operator at the BVI.
WOMAN (over P.A.):
American Airlines 355 serving Chicago and San Francisco is now open for passenger check-in.
How'd you do it, Frank?
How'd you pass the bar in Louisiana?
What are you doing here?
Listen...
I'm sorry I put you through all this.
You go back to Europe, you're gonna die in Perpignan Prison.
You try to run here in the States we'll send you back to Atlanta for 50 years.
I know that.
I spent four years trying to arrange your release.
Had to convince my bosses at the FBI and the Attorney General of the United States you wouldn't run.
Why'd you do it?
You're just a kid.
I'm not your kid.
You said you were going to Chicago.
My daughter can't see me this weekend.
She's going skiing.
You said she was four years old. You're lying.
She was four when I left.
Now she's 15.
My wife's been remarried for 11 years.
I see Grace every now and again.
I don't understand.
Sure you do.
Sometimes it's easier living the lie.
I'm going to let you fly tonight, Frank.
I'm not even going to try to stop you.
That's 'cause I know you'll be back on Monday. Yeah?
How do you know I'll come back?
Look.
Frank... nobody's chasing you.
WOMAN (over P.A.): American Airlines flight 131 to Pittsburgh is now ready for boarding. Passengers with boarding passes, please proceed to Gate 23A.
Alice, has he still not called?
No, he hasn't.
HANRATTY: Good morning.
I've, uh, called this meeting to discuss a new type of check fraud and counterfeiting which the unsub is washing and altering checks then passing them throughout Arizona.
(panting)
This unsub is a big dog passing checks as large as five figures.
Sorry I'm late.
Sorry.
We have a recovered check on Agent Reiter's desk.
Why don't we step out to the bullpen?
There's impressions on every line.
Looks like the original amount was for $60.
Mind if I take a look?
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.
Cost the bank $16,000.
It's a real check.
Yeah. Yeah.
It's been washed.
The only thing original is the signature.
But it's perfect, Carl. I mean...
I mean, this isn't hydrochloride or bleach.
No.
Something new.
Maybe a nail polish remover where the acetone removes the ink that's not been printed?
How did you do it, Frank?
How did you cheat on the bar exam in Louisiana?
I didn't cheat.
I studied for two weeks and I passed.
Is that the truth, Frank?
Is that the truth?
I'll bet this guy steals checks out of mailboxes.
He washes off their names and he puts on his own.
You're saying that he's a local? Well, if it were me, you know
I'd call the bank first, I'd check out the balance...
Make sure there's enough money in there to make it worth your while.
Exactly.
You know, Carl, I think this guy's pretty smart.
I guess all we have to do now is catch him.
We'll start first thing in the morning.
See you tomorrow.
I'm in.
We're almost there. - Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.
I understand, sir.
It's just that I'm scoping some serious sentinel activity up here.
- Yes, sir?
Given your situation, I can't say I understand your reasons for volunteering to operate onboard my ship.
However, if you wish to continue to do so, I must ask you to do one thing. What's that, sir?
To trust me.
Yes, sir.
I will, sir.
- I mean, I do, sir. - I hope so.
Repatch the main AC to the hard drives and stand by to broadcast.
Still can't sleep?
You wanna talk?
They're just dreams.
If you're afraid of something... I just wish...
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do. That's all. I just wish I knew.
She's gonna call.
Don't worry. Here you are.
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.
These geotherms confirm the last transmission of the Osiris.
The machines are digging.
They're boring from the surface down to Zion. - Mother...
- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.
How fast are they moving?
Control estimates their descent at 100 meters an hour.
- Almost 2000 meters.
- What about the scans from the Osiris?
- They can't be accurate.
- They may be.
- It's not possible.
That'd mean there are a quarter-million sentinels.
- That can't be.
Why not?
A sentinel for every man, woman and child in Zion.
That sounds exactly like the thinking of a machine to me.
Morpheus, glad you could join us.
Niobe.
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware it's become difficult to locate a secure broadcast position.
- Squiddies got our best spots. - Lines are crawling with them.
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours there's gonna be a quarter-million more.
We're gonna do what Commander Lock ordered.
We'll evacuate broadcast level and return to Zion.
And does the commander have a plan for stopping 250,000 sentinels?
A strategy is still being formulated.
I'm sure it is.
What do you think we should do, Morpheus? - We should proceed as ordered...
- What is it? I don't know.
...however, I must ask one of you for help.
Some of you believe as I believe, some of you do not.
Those of you that do know we are nearing the end of our struggle.
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be the Oracle must be consulted.
If we return and recharge now we can be back in 36 hours, well before the machines reach this depth.
Do you understand what you're asking?
I am asking that one ship remain here in our place in case the Oracle should attempt to contact us.
You're asking one of us to disobey a direct order.
That's right, I am.
What happens when you get back to Zion and the commander throws you in the stockade? He won't.
Goddamn it, Morpheus, you ain't never gonna change.
Shit, I'll do it just to see what Deadbolt does to you. You got 36 hours.
I'm looking for Neo. - Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.
A gift.
You see, he set me free.
Fine, whatever. Now piss off. - Who was that?
- How did you know someone was here?
He gave you this.
He said you set him free.
Is everything all right, sir? The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?
Go.
Hiya, fellas. - It's him. - The anomaly.
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.
- He is still...
- Only human.
Upgrades.
- That went as expected. - Yes.
It's happening exactly as before.
Well, not exactly.
- I can't figure it out.
Agents just came out of nowhere.
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.
- Is Neo okay?
- Okay?
Shit, you should've seen him.
Where is he now?
He's doing his Superman thing.
Where are you?
This is the Nebuchadnezzar, requesting access through Gate Three.
Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by. Roger that, Control.
This is Control requesting immediate stand-down of arms at Gate Three.
We have the Nebuchadnezzar on approach.
Let's open her up.
You are cleared through Gate Three to Bay Seven.
Roger that, Control.
Door's open, bed's made. Welcome home.
No place like it.
Roger that, Control.
Zion Control, stand by for Gate Three lockdown.
The Nebuchadnezzar is down. Bay Seven.
Understood.
Captain Mifune.
Captain Morpheus.
Are you here to escort me to the stockade, captain?
- I'm just here to keep the peace. - Commander Lock demands...
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.
- Link. - Sir?
I want the ship ready to go as soon as possible.
Understood, sir.
- What is it between them? - Morpheus and Lock?
- Captain Niobe?
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.
What happened?
Morpheus went to the Oracle. After that, everything changed.
Yeah, she can do that. Neo!
- Oh, no.
- How does he always know?
Doesn't he have anything better to do?
You know what they say about the life you save.
I didn't save his life.
Hiya, Neo.
- Trinity, Link. - Hey.
- It's great to have you back.
It's good to be back.
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, I can carry my own bag. - Trinity?
- I'm fine.
- You can carry these. - Yeah, sure, Link.
Hey, you know, next year I'm old enough to join a crew, right?
I've been thinking about it, and I've made my decision.
Let me guess.
I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.
Morpheus hasn't filled the other positions, except for you, Link.
I'm sure he has reasons but the more I think about it, the more I think it's meant to be.
You know, it's fate.
You're the reason I'm here, Neo. I told you, you found me.
I didn't find you.
I know, but you got me out. You saved me.
You saved yourself.
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.
I spoke to the other captains.
I wanted to offer you a chance to explain your actions.
I wasn't aware that my actions required any explanation.
You were given an order to return to Zion. - I did.
- You asked for one ship to remain behind.
I would have stayed, but I needed to recharge my ship.
So you admit to a direct contravention of your duty.
We need a presence inside the Matrix to await contact from the Oracle.
I don't want to hear that shit!
I don't care about oracles or prophecies or messiahs!
I care about one thing: Stopping that army from destroying this city.
To do that I need soldiers to obey my orders.
With all due respect, commander, there is only one way to save our city.
How? - Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.
Not everyone believes what you believe.
My beliefs do not require them to.
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's talking.
A lot of people are scared.
No one remembers the last time so many ships were docked.
- Something big is happening, isn't it? - Hey.
We're not allowed to say anything, so stop asking.
Goddamn, it's good to be home.
I'm recommending that you be removed from duty.
That is, of course, your prerogative, commander.
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot on a ship for the rest of your life.
Then I am grateful that it is not up to you.
- Councillor Hamann. - Commander.
- Captain.
- Councillor.
Council's asked me to speak tonight at the temple gathering.
The presence of the fleet and the persistence of rumors must be addressed.
The people must be told what is happening.
Of course, councillor.
But might I advise a level of discretion concerning specific details.
- We do not wish to start a panic. - Quite right.
A panic is not what anyone wants.
What about you, captain? What would you advise?
The truth.
No one will panic, because there is nothing to fear.
That army won't reach the gates of Zion.
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.
Consider that in the past six months we have freed more minds than in six years. This attack is an act of desperation.
I believe very soon the prophecy will be fulfilled and this war will end.
I hope you're right, captain.
I do not believe it to be a matter of hope, councillor.
It is simply a matter of time.
My stop.
See you soon.
Hopefully not too soon.
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I am if you're thinking this elevator is too slow.
- How long do we charge the Neb? - Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.
Some people go their entire lives without hearing news that good.
Neo, please, I have a son, Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.
I have a daughter on the Icarus.
No, wait.
It's all right.
They need you.
- I need you. - I know.
There's time.
Where's my puss...?
- Hey!
- Uncle Link!
God!
Uncle Link!
Oh, my God!
You're so huge!
- You should be picking me up!
- No!
- Yeah! - Okay!
Okay?
All right.
Now, we're gonna have to work together here, okay?
One, two, three, lift!
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?
Come on, kids. It's time to go.
- Hey, Cas. - Hey.
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.
You be careful with her.
Don't worry about me. He's the one that's gonna get it.
Out the door! Both of you, march!
- Bye!
- Bye!
I'm gonna get what?
Every ship up there's been home two, even three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.
- We'll be when you operate another ship.
- I can't do that.
- Why?
- You know why.
If Dozer knew how I felt, he wouldn't have asked you to do this.
Maybe. But it's too late now.
I made a promise, and some promises can't be unmade.
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.
You think Cas thinks it's fair that I'm here and Dozer's not?
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.
I'm afraid of it.
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.
It won't.
How can you say that to me?
Because of Morpheus.
Because of what he's told me. He said that this is it, that it will be over soon.
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what after being on that ship and seeing Neo do the things he can do, I gotta say I'm starting to believe him too.
Be careful, Link.
Please be careful.
- They started yet?
- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.
Tonight, let us honor these men and women.
These are our soldiers, our warriors.
These are our husbands and wives, our brothers and sisters our children.
Let us remember those that have been lost and let us give thanks for those that have been found and who stand here beside us.
Now I would like someone else to close this prayer someone who hasn't spoken here in a long time but who I believe has something to say that we all need to hear.
I give you Morpheus.
Zion!
Hear me!
It is true what many of you have heard.
The machines have gathered an army, and as I speak that army is drawing nearer to our home.
Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us.
But if we are to be prepared for it, we must first shed our fear of it.
I stand here before you now truthfully unafraid.
Why?
Because I believe something you do not?
No!
I stand here without fear because I remember.
I remember that I am here not because of the path that lies before me but because of the path that lies behind me.
I remember that for 100 years we have fought these machines.
I remember that for 100 years they have sent their armies to destroy us.
And after a century of war, I remember that which matters most:
We are still here!
Tonight let us send a message to that army.
Tonight, let us shake this cave.
Tonight, let us tremble these halls of earth, steel and stone. Let us be heard from red core to black sky.
Tonight, let us make them remember:
This is Zion and we are not afraid!
I remember.
I remember you used to dance.
I remember you were pretty good.
There are some things in this world, Captain Niobe that will never change.
Niobe!
Some things do change.
Excuse me.
- I missed you.
- I can tell.
I was thinking, everyone is here.
Follow me.
Neo, what is it?
What's wrong?
It's okay, you can tell me.
Trinity...
Don't be afraid.
I can't lose you.
You're not gonna lose me.
You feel this?
I'm never letting go.
Good night, Zion.
Sweet dreams.
- You all right?
- I'll make it.
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is this.
You first.
- Oh, God.
- "Smith" will suffice.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.
I don't want to intrude if you'd prefer to be alone.
- No, I could probably use some company.
So could I.
It's nice tonight.
Very calm.
It feels like everyone is sleeping very peacefully.
Not everyone.
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.
I figure I slept the first 11 years of my life, now I'm making up for it.
- What about you?
- I just haven't been able to sleep much.
- It's a good sign.
- Of what? That you are in fact still human.
Have you ever been to the engineering level?
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.
- Would you like to see it?
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.
That's how it is with people.
Nobody cares how it works as long as it works.
I like it down here.
I like to be reminded this city survives because of these machines.
These machines are keeping us alive while other machines are coming to kill us.
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.
Yeah, I suppose we do, but sometimes I think about those people still plugged into the Matrix.
And when I look at these machines I can't help thinking that, in a way, we are plugged into them.
But we control these machines, they don't control us.
Of course not.
How could they?
The idea is pure nonsense but it does make one wonder just what is control?
If we wanted, we could shut these machines down.
Of course.
That's it.
You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?
If we wanted, we could smash them to bits.
Although if we did, we'd have to consider what would happen to our lights our heat, our air.
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?
No. No point.
Old men like me don't bother with making points.
Is that why there are no young men on the Council?
Good point.
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind, councillor.
There is so much in this world that I do not understand.
See that machine?
It has something to do with recycling our water supply.
I have absolutely no idea how it works.
But I do understand the reason for it to work.
I have absolutely no idea how you are able to do some of the things you do.
But I believe there's a reason for that as well.
I only hope we understand that reason before it's too late.
- Ballard.
Neo, it's from the Oracle.
It's time to go.
Morpheus said this was how it was gonna happen.
I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true, maybe it's not.
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.
Right now, that operator's me.
I know.
- Zee...
- I want you to wear it. - You know I don't believe in this stuff.
- But I do. It's always brought me luck.
- Maybe it'll bring me you.
- I'm coming back.
I promise. No matter what it takes, I'm coming home.
Just keep it with you.
Please.
For me.
Okay.
- Neo!
- How the hell...?
Bane.
Is something wrong? No, I'm fine.
I just wanted to catch you to say good luck.
Thanks.
We'll see you.
Neo!
Just in time.
- You're gonna see the Oracle?
- There's no time. I had to give something to Neo.
A gift from one of the orphans.
He made me swear to get it to you before you left.
He said you'd understand.
Thanks.
I was just told you cleared the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.
That is correct.
Am I still in charge of our defense system?
Of course. I believe I need every ship we have if we're going to survive this attack.
I understand that, commander.
Then why did you allow the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?
Because I believe our survival depends on more than how many ships we have.
Be careful.
Hello.
- You seek the Oracle.
I am Seraph. I can take you to her, but first I must apologize.
Apologize for what?
For this.
Good.
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.
- Of what?
- That you are the One.
- You could have just asked.
You do not truly know someone until you fight them.
Come. She's waiting.
Where the hell did they go?
These are back doors, aren't they?
Programmer access.
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.
One position opens a lock and another position opens one of these doors.
Are you a programmer?
Then what are you?
I protect that which matters most.
Well, come on.
I ain't gonna bite you.
Come around here and let me have a look at you.
My goodness, look at you.
You turned out all right, didn't you?
- How do you feel?
- L...
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.
Why don't you come and have a sit this time.
- Maybe I'll stand.
- Well, suit yourself.
- I felt like sitting.
So let's get the obvious stuff out of the way.
- You're not human, are you?
- It's tough to get more obvious than that.
If I had to guess, I'd say you're a program from the machine world.
- So is he.
- So far, so good.
But if that's true, that could mean you're part of this system another kind of control.
- I suppose the most obvious question is how can I trust you?
- Bingo.
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is there's no way you can really know if I'm here to help you or not.
So it's really up to you.
Just have to make up your own damn mind to either accept what I'm going to tell you or reject it.
Candy?
- Do you already know if I'll take it?
- Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.
But if you already know, how can I make a choice?
Because you didn't come here to make the choice.
You've already made it. You're here to try to understand why you made it.
I thought you'd have figured that out by now.
- Why are you here?
- Same reason. I love candy.
But why help us?
We're all here to do what we're all here to do.
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
The future. And believe me, I know, the only way to get there is together.
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but...
Look.
See those birds? At some point, a program was written to govern them.
A program was written to watch over the trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.
There are programs running all over the place.
The ones doing their job, doing what they were meant to do, are invisible.
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...
Well, you hear about them all the time.
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.
Every time you've heard someone say they saw a ghost or an angel every story you've ever heard about vampires, werewolves or aliens is the system assimilating some program that's doing something they're not supposed to be doing.
Programs hacking programs.
- Why?
- They have their reasons but usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion.
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.
Maybe a better program is created to replace it.
Happens all the time.
And when it does, a program can either choose to hide here or return to the source.
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes. Where you must go.
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it in your dreams, haven't you?
A door made of light?
What happens when you go through the door?
I see Trinity and something happens something bad.
She starts to fall, and then I wake up.
- Do you see her die?
- No. You have the sight now, Neo.
You are looking at the world without time.
Then why can't I see what happens to her?
We can never see past the choices we don't understand. Are you saying I have to choose whether Trinity lives or dies?
No, you've already made the choice.
Now you have to understand it.
No. I can't do that.
I won't. - Well, you have to.
- Why? Because you're the One.
What if I can't?
What happens if I fail? Then Zion will fall.
Our time is up.
Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion if you reach the source, but to do that you need the Keymaker.
The Keymaker?
He disappeared.
We didn't know what happened to him until now.
He's being held prisoner by a very dangerous program one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want? What do all men with power want?
More power.
Be there at that exact time and you will have a chance.
We must go.
Seems like every time we meet I got nothing but bad news.
I'm sorry about that.
I surely am.
But for what it's worth you've made a believer out of me.
Good luck, kiddo.
Mr. Anderson. Did you get my package?
- Yeah.
- Well, good.
- Smith?
- He's not reading like an agent. - Surprised to see me?
- No.
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what? Our connection.
I don't fully understand how it happened.
Perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me something overwritten or copied.
It is, at this point, irrelevant. What matters is that whatever happened, happened for a reason.
And what reason is that?
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.
With a certain satisfaction, I might add.
And then something happened, something that I knew was impossible but it happened anyway.
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do but I didn't.
I couldn't.
I was compelled to stay...
And now, here I stand because of you, Mr. Anderson.
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent of this system.
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
But as you well know, appearances can be deceiving which brings me back to the reason why we're here.
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free. There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose.
Because as we both know, without purpose we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.
- Purpose that connects us.
- Purpose that pulls us.
- That guides us. - That drives us.
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.
We are here because of you, Mr. Anderson. We're here to take from you what you tried to take from us:
Purpose.
- What's happening to him?
Yes, that's it.
It'll be over soon.
- You.
Me, me, me.
It is inevitable.
Are you all right?
- It was Smith. - Yes.
- Now there's more than one of them?
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.
Somehow, he's found a way to copy himself.
- Is that what he was doing to you?
- I don't know what he was doing but I know what it felt like.
- What?
It felt like I was back in that hallway.
It felt like dying.
The machines are tunneling to avoid our defense system.
But I believe they will intersect certain pipelines to control them.
These points of intersection are crucial because I believe they're vulnerable to counterattack.
Although it has been suggested that this is the same kind of attack we've defended for years, I urge the Council to realize the truth.
This is the single greatest threat we have ever faced and if we do not act accordingly, we will not survive.
Commander Lock, the Council is well aware of the seriousness of this attack.
You have our leave to prepare our defense by any and all means necessary.
- Thank you, Council.
- However we ask if there's been word from the Nebuchadnezzar.
No, councillor.
Nothing. Then we request a ship be dispatched to ascertain the fate of the One.
I wish that were possible, councillor, but I do not believe our defense can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.
It could take one ship days to find the Nebuchadnezzar.
- Then send two.
- This is insane.
Careful, commander.
Forgive my frustration, councillors.
But I wish I were able to comprehend the Council's choice in this matter.
Comprehension is not a requisite of cooperation.
If you are asking me to order two of my captains...
There's no need for such an order.
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves. The Council is calling for two volunteers to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.
Are there two among you that would answer such a call?
Captain Soren of the Vigilant will answer the Council's call.
You understand the situation, Captain Soren?
- Thank you, captain.
Is there another?
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.
- Listen...
Is there no other?
Be hard for any man to risk his life especially if he doesn't understand the reason.
Captain Niobe of the Logos will answer the councillor's call.
- What? - Thank you, Captain Niobe.
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
- Niobe, what are you doing?
Why?
Because some things never change, Jason and some things do.
What can you see, Neo?
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.
- Encrypted? - Maybe.
Is that good for us or bad for us?
Well, it looks like every floor is wired with explosives.
Bad for us.
Yes.
We are here to speak with the Merovingian.
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.
Here he is at last.
Neo, the One himself.
Right?
And the legendary Morpheus.
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.
You honor me. Please, sit.
This is my wife, Persephone.
Something to eat?
Drink?
Of course, such things are contrivances, like so much here.
For the sake of appearances.
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course.
Who has time? Who has time? But then, if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time?
Château Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.
I love French wine like I love the French language. I have sampled every language.
French is my favorite. Fantastic language especially to curse with.
You see?
It's like wiping your ass with silk.
I love it.
You know why we are here.
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can. The question is, do you know why you are here?
We are looking for the Keymaker.
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.
But this is not a reason, this is not a why.
The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is a means, it is not an end. And so to look for him is to be looking for a means to do what?
- You know the answer to that question.
But do you?
You think you do, but you do not.
You are here because you were sent here.
You were told to come here, and then you obeyed.
It is, of course, the way of all things.
You see, there is only one constant one universal.
It is the only real truth.
Causality.
Action, reaction.
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.
No. Wrong. Choice is an illusion created between those with power and those without.
Look there at that woman.
My God, just look at her affecting everyone around her.
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
You see, I have sent her a dessert a very special dessert.
I wrote it myself.
It starts so simply each line of the program creating a new effect, just like poetry.
First a rush, heat.
Her heart flutters.
You can see it, Neo, yes?
She does not understand why.
Is it the wine?
What is it then? What is the reason?
And soon it does not matter.
Soon the why and the reason are gone and all that matters is the feeling itself.
And this is the nature of the universe.
We struggle against it, we fight to deny it but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.
Beneath our poised appearance the truth is, we are completely out of control.
Causality.
There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it. Our only hope, our only peace, is to understand it, to understand the why.
"Why" is what separates us from them you from me.
"Why" is the only real source of power. Without it, you are powerless.
And this is how you come to me, without why, without power.
Another link in the chain.
But fear not.
Since I have seen how good you are at following orders I will tell you what to do next.
Run back and give the fortuneteller this message:
Her time is almost up.
Now I have some real business to do, so I will say adieu and goodbye.
- This isn't over. - Oh, yes, it is. The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason why I should give him up.
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?
Please, ma chérie, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.
I drank too much wine, I must take a piss.
Cause and effect.
Touch me and that hand will never touch anything again.
Well, that didn't go so well.
Are you certain the Oracle didn't say anything else?
- Yes. - Maybe we did something wrong.
Or didn't do something.
No, what happened couldn't have happened any other way.
- We are still alive. If you want the Keymaker, follow me.
Get out. I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick. A long time ago, when we first came here, it was so different.
He was so different.
I'll give you what you want, but you have to give me something.
- What?
Excuse me?
I want you to kiss me as if you were kissing her.
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.
It's all over you both.
A long time ago, I knew what that felt like.
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it.
That's all. Just a sample.
- Why don't you sample this instead?
- Trinity.
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss. Why should we trust you?
All right.
But you have to make me believe I am her.
Wait.
Yes.
I envy you.
It's all right, boys. They're with me.
These fellas work for my husband.
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.
Aren't you, boys? Yes, mistress.
They come from a much older version of the Matrix.
But like so many back then, they caused more problems than they solved.
My husband saved them because they're notoriously difficult to terminate.
You can either run and tell my husband what I have done or you can stay there and die.
- My name is Neo.
- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.
My God!
My God, Persephone, how could you do this?
You betray me.
- Cause and effect, my love.
There is no cause for this.
What cause? What cause?
How about the lipstick you're still wearing?
Lipstick? Lipstick.
What craziness are you talking about, woman?
There is no lipstick!
She wasn't kissing your face, my love. Woman, this is nothing.
- It is a game.
It is only a game.
- So is this.
All right.
All right.
Let us find out where this goes.
That's a nice trick.
I cannot go back.
I'll handle them.
Handle us? You'll handle us?
Okay, you have some skill.
Goddamn it, woman, you will be the end of me.
Mark my words, boy, and mark them well.
- Where are you going?
We owe you for that.
- Stay with him.
He can handle himself.
Shit. - Operator. - Link, where am I?
You won't believe this, but you're way up in the mountains.
- Really?
- What?
The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity. They don't have a way out.
- Operator.
- Get us out of here. - Won 't be easy. - I know.
We're inside the core network.
The only exit I got near you is the Winslow overpass.
- Off the freeway.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, no.
This is getting real ugly real fast.
Are you watching this, Link?
There's an all points on you. Eight units headed your way.
Any suggestions?
Straight here.
You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.
- Got it. - You sure about this?
The freeway, I mean.
- In 14 years of operating, I've never seen...
- Link, what did I tell you?
Yes, sir.
I do, sir.
Winslow overpass. - I'll be ready for you.
- Good man.
You always told me to stay off the freeway.
- Yes, that's true.
- You said it was suicide.
- Operator. - Link, it's Niobe.
We've been sent to bring you in.
- I need to talk to Morpheus.
Repeat, they're approaching the...
- We have them now.
Shots fired.
Trinity.
Get him out of here.
Morpheus. He's okay.
I need a download to hot-wire a motorcycle.
One crash course on motorcycle...
Wait.
Cancel that.
She means nothing.
- Find the exile.
We do only what we're meant to do.
Then you are meant for one more thing:
Neo, if you're out there, I could use some help.
We have confirmation from the Icarus.
First two ships are in position for counterattack.
Good.
Any change?
They hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little. - How much?
- An hour, maybe.
There is a building.
Inside this building, there is a level where no elevator can go and no stair can reach.
This level is filled with doors.
These doors lead to many places. Hidden places.
But one door is special.
This building is protected by a very secure system.
- Every alarm triggers the bomb.
- Bomb? Did he say bomb? But like all systems, it has a weakness.
The system is based on the rules of a building.
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.
- Lf one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.
You'd have to take out a city block to kill the power.
- Not one, 27. - Twenty-seven blocks?
There is a power station.
It must be destroyed.
- There must be some kind of fail-safe. - Yes, there is an emergency system.
The core network of the grid must be accessed.
The emergency system must be deactivated.
What do you need us for?
Neo could take them out easier than we could.
- There's no time. - Why?
Once the door is unprotected, the connection will be severed.
But another connection must first be made.
- How long will that take?
- Exactly 314 seconds.
Just over five minutes.
That is the length and breadth of the window.
Only the One can open the door and only during that window can the door be opened.
How do you know all this?
I know because I must know. It is my purpose.
Neo, I know something's wrong.
You don't have to tell me.
I just want you to know that I'm here.
Can't hurt.
If one fails all fail.
At midnight, there is a shift change in the security of both buildings.
At midnight, we will strike.
Hey!
Okay, they're inside.
Oh, shit.
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight is not an accident.
There are no accidents.
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.
When I see three objectives, three captains, three ships I do not see coincidence.
I see purpose.
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.
I believe this night holds for each and every one of us the very meaning of our lives.
I want to ask you to do something, but I don't know how.
I promise you, if I can, I will.
What if I asked you to stay out of this no matter what to stay out of the Matrix?
All right.
What is it, Niobe?
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't help thinking, what if you're wrong?
What if all this, the prophecy, everything, is bullshit?
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.
This is a war, and we are soldiers.
Death can come for us at any time in any place.
Now consider the alternative.
What if I am right? What if the prophecy is true?
What if tomorrow the war could be over?
Isn't that worth fighting for?
Isn't that worth dying for?
It is done.
Find the others.
I got Niobe there.
They're out of the station.
- What about Soren?
That's it, let's go.
Call Neo now.
- What about the grid?
Jesus.
Soon as they open that door, it's all over.
The hell it is.
What are you...?
Trinity! I will not wait and do nothing.
I will not watch them die.
We're talking less than five minutes.
In five minutes, I'll tear that building down.
- How much further? - Here, just here.
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.
It's gotta be the ugliest hack I have ever done.
- Operator. - I'm in. Keep moving.
Sixty-fifth floor. You look surprised to see me again, Mr. Anderson.
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you. - What do you want, Smith? - You haven't figured that out?
Still using all the muscles except the one that matters.
I want exactly what you want.
I want everything.
Would that include a bullet from this gun? Go ahead, shoot.
Christ!
If you can't beat us...
Come on.
It was meant to be.
Hello, Neo.
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.
I created the Matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions.
Though the process has altered your consciousness you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand and some you will not.
Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant.
Why am I here? Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the Matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I've been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision.
While it remains a burden assiduously avoided it is not unexpected and thus not beyond a measure of control which has led you, inexorably here.
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.
Others? How many? What others?
The Matrix is older than you know.
I count from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next.
In which case, this is the sixth version. Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.
There are only two possible explanations. There were five before me.
Either no one told me or no one knows.
- Precisely.
As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.
You can 't control me! I'm gonna smash you to bits!
You can 't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!
The first Matrix I designed was naturally perfect, a work of art.
Flawless, sublime.
A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure.
The inevitability of its doom is apparent now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human.
Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature.
However, I was again frustrated by failure.
I have come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind.
Or perhaps, a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection.
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche.
If I am the father of the Matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.
- The Oracle. - Please.
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby 99 percent of subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level.
While this answer functioned, it was fundamentally flawed thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly that, if left unchecked, might threaten the system.
Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.
This is about Zion. You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed.
Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.
Bullshit. Denial is the most predictable of all human responses.
But rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.
The function of the One is now to return to the source, allowing a dissemination of the code you carry reinserting the prime program.
After which you will be required to select from the Matrix 23 individuals sixteen female, seven male, to rebuild Zion.
Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the Matrix which, coupled with the extermination of Zion will result in the extinction of the entire human race.
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.
There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.
It is interesting reading your reactions.
Your five predecessors were, by design, based on a similar predication a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the One.
While the others experience this in a general way your experience is far more specific vis-á-vis love.
Trinity!
Apropos, she entered the Matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.
No. Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed and the anomaly revealed as both beginning and end.
There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source and the salvation of Zion.
The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her and the end of your species.
As you adequately put, the problem is choice.
But we already know what you are going to do, don't we?
Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.
An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth:
She is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it.
Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.
If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.
I know.
Trinity. ...I know you can hear me.
I'm not letting go.
I can't take this.
I don't understand it.
Everything was done as it was supposed to be done.
Once the One reaches the source, the war should be over.
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?
If we don't do something in 24 hours, Zion will be destroyed.
- What? - How do you know that?
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?
It doesn't matter.
I believed him. - That's impossible. The prophecy tells us...
- It was a lie, Morpheus. The prophecy was a lie.
The One was never meant to end anything.
It was all another system of control.
I don't believe that.
I'm sorry.
I know it isn't easy to hear, but I swear to you it's the truth.
- What are we gonna do?
- What are they doing? - They're just out of EMP range.
I have dreamed a dream but now that dream has gone from me.
Here they come.
- Come on!
- I don't know.
He's in some kind of coma but his vitals are stable.
What about you?
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines would cut off the mainlines in and out of Zion.
He thought a counterattack might surprise them.
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot until someone screwed it up.
An EMP was triggered before we got in position. - Five ships were instantly downed.
- When the machines broke through it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction? - No one knows. - Someone does.
Who?
Once the machines were done with us, they started digging again.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.
Nothing but blue pills.
Should we try to contact them?
Won't matter.
My gut says they're down.
-We should start back.
-lf that ship can fly, we need it.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Search every pipe, every hole, every crack we know.
Sweep as wide as possible, as fast as possible.
-Lines are crawling with calamari.
-The sooner we find them the better.
Thank you.
Any change?
No.
-How is he?
-He's gonna be fine.
At least until he wakes up.
-What do you mean?
-Captain has some questions for him.
He'd better have some good answers.
You see these cuts? I think they're self-inflicted.
-Why?
-VDTs maybe.
I don't know.
But like I said, the answer better be good.
Roland, I'd like to run another search through the Matrix. -For what? -For Neo.
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in. Please, for me.
What?
His neural patterns don't read like someone who's in a coma.
The strange thing is, I see these patterns all the time.
-Where? -On someone jacked in.
He's not in there.
-Sir, I got the projections. -How long?
Based on point of entry and past speed, the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.
Jesus H. Christ.
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns manned at all times.
And make sure we are running on as few pads as possible.
You got a call.
-What? Operator.
It's Seraph.
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.
-Who are you? -My name is Sati.
Your name is Neo.
My papa says you're not supposed to be here.
He says you must be lost.
Are you lost, Neo?
-This is the train station.
-That's where the train goes.
That's where we're going, but you cannot go with us.
-Why not?
-He won't let you.
-Who won't?
I don't like him.
But my papa says we have to do what the Trainman says or else he will leave us here forever and ever.
Morpheus, Trinity, thank you for coming.
One thing I've learned in all my years is that nothing ever works out the way you want it to.
-Who are you? -I'm the Oracle.
I wish there was an easy way to get through this, but there ain't.
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here like you remember me...
-...but it wasn't meant to be.
-What happened?
I made a choice, and that choice cost me more than I wanted it to.
What choice?
To help you, to guide Neo.
Now, since the real test for any choice is having to make the same choice again knowing full well what it might cost I guess I feel pretty good about that choice because here I am, at it again.
-Do you know what happened to Neo?
-Yes.
He is trapped in a place between this world and the machine world.
The link is controlled by a program called the Trainman.
He uses it to smuggle programs in and out of the Matrix.
If he finds out where Neo is before you get to him then I'm afraid our choices are going to become difficult.
-Why? -Because of who the Trainman works for.
The Merovingian.
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.
For years he has protected me.
I hope he can do the same for you.
Please, follow me.
I know, Morpheus.
I can see you're filled with doubt, clouded by uncertainty.
After everything that has happened, how can you expect me to believe you?
I don't.
I expect just what I've always expected:
For you to make up your own damn mind.
Believe me or don't.
All I can do is tell you that your friend is in trouble, and he needs your help.
He needs all our help. -Are you from the Matrix?
-Yes. No.
-I mean, I was.
-Why did you leave?
-I had to.
-I had to leave my home too.
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.
Yes, Papa.
She is still very curious. -I know you.
-Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.
I am Rama-Kandra.
This is my wife, Kamala.
My daughter, Sati.
We are most honored to meet you.
-You are programs. -Oh, yes.
I am the power-plant systems manager for recycling operations.
My wife is an interactive software programmer.
She is highly creative. What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.
Kamala!
Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.
It's okay.
I don't have an answer.
-I don't even know where "here" is.
-This place is nowhere.
It is between your world and our world.
-Who's the Trainman?
-He works for the Frenchman.
Why did I know you would say that?
The Frenchman does not forget, and he does not forgive.
-You know him? -I know only what I need to know.
I know if you want to take something from our world into your world that does not belong there, you must go to the Frenchman.
Is that what you're doing here?
-Rama, please.
-I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.
He may never see another face for the rest of his life.
I'm sorry.
-You don't have to answer that question.
-No, I don't mind.
The answer is simple.
I find her to be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
But where we are from, that is not enough.
Every program that is created must have a purpose.
If it does not, it is deleted.
I went to the Frenchman to save my daughter.
-You do not understand.
-I just have never--
Heard a program speak of love.
-lt is a human emotion.
-No, it is a word.
What matters is the connection the word implies.
I see that you are in love.
Can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection? Anything.
Then perhaps the reason you are here is not so different than the reason I am here.
That's him. -Get away! Get away from me!
-We don't want trouble.
-Get the hell away from me!
-We need your help.
I can't help you!
No one can help you!
-When is the train due? -lt is already late.
It's not like the Trainman to be late.
You think it has something to do with me?
I cannot say.
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.
-You know the Oracle?
-Everyone knows the Oracle.
I consulted with her before I met with the Frenchman.
She promised to watch Sati after we said goodbye.
Goodbye?
-You're not staying with her?
-lt is not possible.
Our arrangement with the Frenchman was for our daughter only.
-My wife and I must return to our world. -Why? -That is our karma.
-You believe in karma?
Karma is a word, like love.
A way of saying:
"What I am here to do. "
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.
Grateful for my wonderful wife, for my beautiful daughter.
They are gifts, and so I do what I must do to honor them.
-Yes. Find your bag.
Quickly.
All right.
-He is a friend.
I know you.
-So that's what they wanted.
-I need to get back.
I'll pay you whatever you want.
One way or another, I'm getting on this train.
Oh, no, no, no.
You'll stay here until the Merovingian says different.
If I know him you're gonna be here for a long, long time.
-I don't want to hurt you.
-You don't get it.
I built this place.
Down here, I make the rules.
Down here, I make the threats.
Down here, I'm God.
Get on the train or you'll stay here with him.
She will know what to do. No.
We know what has to be done.
You gotta be kidding. Holy shit, it's wingless.
I get it.
You must be ready to die.
I need to speak with him.
Only way you're getting through this door is over my big, dead ass.
So be it.
There are no weapons allowed in the club.
At the bottom of this elevator, there is a coat-check girl and if we are lucky, one man for checking weapons.
And if we're unlucky?
There will be many men.
Can I take your--?
What in the hell?
I don't believe this.
The prodigal child returns.
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?
Tell me, how many bullets are there in those guns?
I don't know, but I don't think you have enough. -We only want to talk.
-Oh, yes.
I'm sure you do.
You have fought through Hel to do so. Yes? I'll tell you what I will do.
Put down the guns, and I will promise you a safe passage out of here.
-All three of us?
-Oh, yes, yes.
Of course.
Who could have guessed we'd see each other so soon after our last meeting?
The Fates are too kind, eh?
And since you, my little Judas, have brought them here I can only surmise the fortuneteller has found herself another shell?
Disappointing, but not unexpected.
I do hope, however, she has the good manners to learn her lesson and to remember that there is no action without consequence.
And if you take something from me, you will pay the price. You know why we are here?
Come now, what kind of question is this?
It is my business to know.
Some might think this is a strange coincidence, but I do not.
I am curious, though, as to how it actually happened. -Do you know?
-No.
No?
I did not think so.
But it is always best to ask, huh?
We want to make a deal.
Always straight to business, huh, Morpheus? Okay.
I have something you want.
T o make a deal you must have something I want, yes?
And it so happens there is something I want.
Something I have wanted ever since I first came here.
It is said they cannot be taken they can only be given.
What?
The eyes of the Oracle.
I told you before, there is no escaping the nature of the universe.
It is that nature that has again brought you to me.
Where some see coincidence, I see consequence.
Where others see chance I see cost.
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle and I will give you back your savior.
It seems a perfectly fair and reasonable deal to me. Yes?
I don't have time for this shit.
You wanna make a deal? How about this?
You give me Neo, or we all die, right here, right now.
Interesting deal.
You are really ready to die for this man? -Believe it.
-She'll do it.
If she has to, she'll kill every one of us.
She's in love.
It is remarkable how similar the pattern of love is to the pattern of insanity. Time's up.
What's it gonna be, Merv?
You got yourself in here you can get yourself out.
Are you ready for us? Almost, sir.
They got some pretty ancient hacks here.
-But you found Neo?
-Can't you see him?
No, sir.
We read something, but I couldn't tell what.
I can't leave yet.
I have to see her.
Now?
It's my last chance.
That's the secret.
-You've got to use your hands.
-Why?
Cookies need love like everything does.
Neo!
I was hoping to have these done before you got here. Oh, well.
Sati, honey, I think it's time for a tasting.
T ake the bowl to Seraph and find out if they're ready.
Okay.
-I'm glad you got out.
-Me too.
So do you recognize me? -A part of you.
-Yeah, that's how it works.
Some bits you lose, some bits you keep.
I don't yet recognize my face in the mirror but I still love candy.
No, thank you.
Remember how you were when you first walked through my door?
Jittery as a June bug.
And now, just look at you.
You sure did surprise me, Neo, and you still do.
You gave me a few surprises too.
I hope I helped.
You helped me to get here, but my question is, why? Where is this going?
-Where does it end?
-I don't know.
-You don't know or you won't tell me?
-I told you before no one can see beyond a choice they don't understand, and I mean no one.
-What choice?
-lt doesn't matter.
It's my choice.
I have mine to make, same as you have yours.
Does that include what things to tell me and what not to? Of course not.
Why didn't you tell me about the Architect?
About Zion and the ones before me? Why didn't you tell me the truth?
-Because it wasn't time for you to know.
-Who decided it wasn't time?
You know who.
I did.
Then I think it's time for me to know a few more things. So do I.
Tell me how I separated my mind from my body without jacking in.
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels by thinking it.
Tell me just what the hell is happening to me.
The power of the One extends beyond this world.
It reaches from here all the way back to where it came from. -Where?
-The source.
That's what you felt when you touched those sentinels, but you weren't ready.
You should be dead, but apparently you weren't ready for that either.
The Architect said if I didn't return to the source Zion would be destroyed tonight.
You and I may not be able to see beyond our own choices but that man can't see past any choice.
-He doesn't understand them.
He can't.
To him, they are variables in an equation.
One at a time, each variable must be solved, then countered. That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.
What's your purpose?
To unbalance it. Why?
What do you want?
I want the same thing you want, Neo.
And I'm willing to go as far as you are to get it.
The end of the war.
Is it going to end?
One way or another.
Can Zion be saved?
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer to that question, but....
If there is an answer, there's only one place you're going to find it.
-You know where.
And if you can't find the answer then I'm afraid there may be no tomorrow for any of us.
What does that mean?
Everything that has a beginning has an end.
I see the end coming.
I see the darkness spreading. I see death.
And you are all that stands in his way.
Smith.
Very soon, he is going to have the power to destroy this world.
But I believe he won't stop there. He can't.
He won't stop until there's nothing left at all. What is he?
He is you.
Your opposite, your negative.
The result of the equation trying to balance itself out.
-One way or another, Neo this war is going to end.
T onight, the future of both worlds will be in your hands or in his.
How are you feeling? Are you all right?
I need time.
-That figures.
-Captain Roland. -What's up, Maggie?
-Bane is.
He's conscious. Good.
Maybe he's got some answers.
I love that smell.
I sure am going to miss it.
-Oracle.
-I know. I know.
Sati, honey.
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph. Can I come back?
I would like to come back.
-I would like that too.
-Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I hope so, hon, I hope so.
I'm scared, Seraph.
Come.
He's following us.
Well, well, it's been a long time.
I remember chasing you was like chasing a ghost.
I have beaten you before.
Yes, true, but as you can see, things are a little different now.
And you must be the last exile.
-The Oracle told me about you. -Really?
What did she say about me?
That you were a bad man.
Oh, I'm not so bad, once you get to know me.
The great and powerful Oracle, we meet at last.
I suppose you've been expecting me, right?
The all-knowing Oracle is never surprised.
How can she be?
She knows everything.
But if that's true, then why is she here if she knew I was coming?
Why wouldn't she leave?
Maybe you knew I would do that, maybe you didn't.
If you did, that means you baked those cookies and set that plate there deliberately, purposefully which means that you're sitting there also deliberately, purposefully.
What did you do with Sati?
"Cookies need love like everything does. "
You are a bastard.
You would know, Mom.
Do what you're here to do.
Yes, ma'am.
I really wish I could help, but I just....
I don't remember any of it.
What about the cuts on your arms?
Those cuts are more than one day old.
Yeah, definitely.
You're right about that, sir.
They look like they might be self-inflicted.
But why would I do something like that to myself?
Unless, of course, I wasn't myself.
But if I'm not me, then who am I?
-Has this man been tested for VDTs? -Yes, sir.
It was negative.
But he is showing a lot of unusual neural activity.
Some cross-synaptic firing, as well as signs of recent trauma with fresh fibrotic scarring throughout the cortex.
I want the truth. I don't care what it takes.
Make him remember.
Sir, we found her.
-The Logos?
-Yes, sir.
About time we had some goddamn good news.
Are the thermals picking up any signs of life?
No, sir. Nothing yet.
-What about the ship?
-Holographic says the hull's still intact.
-Drop down and keep a man in the turret.
-Yes, sir.
Get a full diagnostic on that ship as fast as humanly possible.
Careful, sir.
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.
What was that?
You can put that shit away, boys.
All she needs is a jump.
-Niobe.
-Morpheus.
-Are you all right?
-Y es, I'm fine.
We didn't know what happened after....
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.
I'm happy to see you too.
-Did you get Neo out?
-Yes.
-How did you know about that?
-The Oracle.
-You saw her?
-Just before the sentinels found us.
-What did she tell you?
-The same thing she always does.
Exactly what I needed to hear.
In 1 2 hours, the machines will breach the dock walls.
Every simulation we've run, we've seen that once the machines are inside the odds of our survival decrease dramatically.
Thus, our primary objective must be to destroy or disable the diggers inside the dock.
If we can do that, perhaps we can prevent them from reaching the city.
If not, the only place we will be able to mount a defense will be at the entrance of the temple.
It is small and will force them into a bottleneck allowing us to concentrate the remainder of our defense.
We understand that you've requested additional volunteers.
-That is correct.
-Precisely what size force are you planning to commit to the primary dock objective?
Right now, the entire APU Corps and half the infantry.
-Half the infantry?
-lf it were up to me, councillor I'd take every man, woman and child, put a gun in their hand and march them into that dock.
Perhaps it is best that it is not up to you.
Time will tell, councillor.
Commander, just one more question.
Has there been word from the Nebuchadnezzar?
None, and at this point there's no reason to expect there will be.
Perhaps.
But we can hope.
I' m afraid hope is an indulgence I don't have time for.
-Zee, what are you doing?
-Making shells.
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.
-I'm not going with you.
-What?
They've called for volunteers to hold the dock.
Kids, you stay here.
I know how you feel, but you can't do this.
-I have to.
-Why?
Because I love him.
I love him the same as he loves me.
And if I were out there and he were here, I know what he'd do.
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.
Maybe it is.
But ask yourself, if it were Dozer and you knew the only chance you had to see him was to hold the dock what would you do?
Make shells.
What the shit is going on over here?
An accident, sir.
I didn't see--
-I'm sorry.
-Who the hell are you?
A unit volunteer, sir.
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you doing volunteering for my Corps?
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.
-How old are you, kid?
-Eighteen.
Should have said 1 6, I might have believed that.
Okay, I'm 1 6.
Minimum age for the Corps is 1 8.
Sixteen's too young.
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.
Ain't that the goddamn truth.
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.
You do and you'll find me and the machines have got something in common.
Okay, charge the igniter.
She lives again.
You want to reload the operations software, Sparky?
Yeah.
Could you clean the windshield while you're at it?
Uplinks in place. I'm bringing her back online.
Looking good, except....
Something's wrong with the Matrix feed.
No, there's not.
You're looking at what we're looking at.
-What's going on in there?
-Whatever it is, it can't be good.
The machines have taken Junction 21.
The way I see it, if we drop down from broadcast here intersect 1 53, we might surprise them.
We'll go first, hammer as deep as we can, then blow our EMP.
Hopefully we can punch a hole big enough for you to get through.
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it, it's the only way back.
No, it's not.
There's another way.
A support line.
It drops down right here, 1 000 meters short of 21.
If we're lucky, we may be able to slip down without them ever knowing.
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.
-No one can pilot mechanical.
-I can.
-Bullshit.
-I've done it.
-That was a long time ago, Niobe.
-I said I can do it.
So what?
You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.
Hi.
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.
-But I wanted to be sure.
-Sure of what?
-I know what I have to do.
-What?
There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just say it.
-I have to take one of the ships.
-What?
T o go where?
T o the machine city.
I know it's difficult to understand.
No, it's not.
You're out of your goddamn mind.
I still have to go.
In 1 00 years, no ship has been within 1 00 kilometers of it.
-You'll never make it.
-I have to try.
-ls this what the Oracle has told you?
This is asinine.
If you want to kill yourself, do it but do it without wasting our ships.
-You have to believe me. I have to go.
-Bullshit!
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!
And this ship will go to hell long before I let you take it anywhere.
-He can take mine.
-You can't do that.
Don't try to tell me what I can or cannot do with my ship after that little speech.
-But for chrissake, Niobe--
-I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.
If we leave inside the hour, we'll reach Zion as the machines do.
That's as good a plan as any.
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.
Two ships, two directions.
Sounds like providence, doesn't it, Morpheus?
-You've never believed in the One.
-I still don't.
Then why are you doing this?
I believe in him.
Thank you.
-What's that for?
-To help you relax.
To make it easier for you to remember.
What if I don't want to remember?
Why would you want that?
What if I blew that EMP?
What if I did destroy those ships and I am responsible for the deaths of all those men?
If I did that it wouldn't be very safe for me here, would it?
Of course, it might not be very safe for you either.
I'm ready.
Trinity there's something I have to say.
Something you need to understand.
I know I'm supposed to go.
But beyond that I don't know.
I.... I know.
You don't think you're coming back.
I knew it the moment you said you had to leave.
I could see it in your face.
Just like you knew the moment you looked at me that I was coming with you.
I'm scared, Trin.
So am I.
It took me 1 0 minutes to buckle up one boot.
But I'll tell you something.
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian I was ready to give anything and everything for you.
Do you know what's changed in the last six hours?
No.
Nothing.
-Finished loading ammunition?
-Just about. Let's move it. We are out of time.
You' re not leaving them anything?
He said he didn't need it.
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.
Thank you.
I can only hope you know what you're doing.
Me too.
It was an honor, sir.
No, the honor is still mine.
-We're ready, sir.
-About damn time.
We're already late, captain, so let's hit it and hit it hard.
Bye, baby.
Take good care of them.
Ready?
Engine's still firing.
Must be a fuse.
I'll check it out.
I should've known he'd send his bitch first.
Bane. No one ever got away from me as many times as you did.
Every time, I thought it was the last.
Every time, I was sure we had you, but you'd slip through our fingers.
I really can't express just how aggravating that can be.
What are you talking about?
I think I might enjoy killing you as much as killing him.
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!
You're gonna pay for that.
-Twenty-seven kilometers to go.
-We got an emergency. -What is it, AK?
-It's Maggie, sir.
She 's dead, murdered.
I think it was Bane. Goddamn it.
I knew it. I knew he was out of his goddamn mind.
He fired that EMP.
Goddamn it, I should have beaten it out of him.
We searched the whole ship, captain.
-I know where he is.
-We gotta go back.
-T oo late. -What if they need our help?
-It's too dangerous.
-Why?
-Because if he's killed them he'll control another EMP.
At this point, they're on their own.
Mr. Anderson.
I see you are as predictable in this world as you are in the other.
-What?
-He's out of his mind.
It might appear that way.
But Mr. Anderson and I know that appearances can be deceiving.
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It'll all become clear in a moment.
Thank you for bringing me the gun.
You can set it down there.
Don't do it.
-Shoot.
Shoot now.
-Yes, shoot. Fry us.
Burn us alive. Do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both.
Look at him.
He knows he should do it, but he won't.
-He can't.
Back away from the gun and turn around.
Let her go.
Somehow familiar, isn't it?
We've been here before, you and I, remember?
I do. I think of nothing else.
-Who are you?
-Still don't recognize me?
I admit, it is difficult to even think encased in this rotting piece of meat.
The stink of it filling every breath, a suffocating cloud you can't escape.
Disgusting.
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.
-What do you want?
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.
Look past the flesh.
Look through the soft gelatin of these dull cow eyes and see your enemy.
-No. -Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.
-lt can't be.
-There's nowhere I can't go.
There is nowhere I won't find you.
-It's impossible.
-Not impossible.
Inevitable.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
This is it.
Oh, no.
I wish you could see yourself, Mr. Anderson.
Blind messiah.
You're a symbol for all of your kind, Mr. Anderson.
Helpless.
Pathetic.
Just waiting to be put out of your misery.
I can see you.
It's not over, Mr. Anderson.
It's not over.
-Trinity!
Neo.
Oh, no.
Your eyes. I'll be okay.
It's all right, Trin.
But I think you're gonna have to drive.
Seismic's projecting 22 minutes to breach.
They can't know we don't have an EMP.
They'll have to attack in waves. Concentrate our offense on the diggers.
Order the APUs into position.
Come on, move.
All right!
This is it.
Now, you all know me, so I'll just say this as simple as I can.
If it's our time to die, it's our time.
All I ask is, if we have to give these bastards our lives we give them hell before we do!
Yeah!
-You scared, Charra?
-Shit, yeah. But I'll make you a deal.
You keep loading, I keep shooting.
Deal.
-Holy Christ, would you look at that.
-Quiet.
-How far to the opening?
-1.4 kilometers.
-We're still generating too hot a field.
-Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.
-Full manual.
Drop down four pads.
-Easy, baby.
-Seven hundred meters.
If we can just get close enough....
Six hundred meters.
There.
Shit!
-Jig's up, here they come.
-Give me full power.
Man the gun turrets, every goddamn one of them.
Go! Ghost, you're the best gunner, go with them.
Morpheus, take his place.
I'm coming, baby.
Here they come.
-Slow down, this ain 't the Logos.
Holy Christ, I didn't know this ship could do that.
Breach!
Knuckle up!
For Zion!
Shit.
Come on, let's go.
Reload nine!
Watch your left!
Don't let them through!
Oh, my God.
Where the hell's my infantry?
-Bogey two at the breach point!
Shit, she's got a fat ass.
-Keep them off me!
-You see that?
-I got incoming!
-We got a dock full of incoming!
-Yes, sir.
But this is different, sir. -What?
I think it's one of ours, sir.
-Holographics are trying to confirm.
Contact them. I want access codes. We're trying, sir.
There's no response. It's a trick.
That's not one of ours, it can't be. That's a mechanical line.
-Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.
-Lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent.
-Shit!
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the Hammer, sir.
How can that be?
It's under attack, sustaining damage.
At present velocity, it'll reach Gate Three in 1 2 minutes.
Their EMP could take out every sentinel. It'd take out more than that.
It'll wipe out our defense system.
We blow an EMP inside, we lose the dock.
Open the gate. Gate Three is not responding!
We've taken critical damage, sir!
There's the exit.
On my mark, give me full power 90 degrees to lower-left starboard.
Full power ninety degrees.
Goddamn, woman, you can drive.
Sentinels are inside the dock.
-How many APUs are operational?
-Thirteen, sir.
Reload!
Forget it, kid!
Get out of here!
Oh, no. They're coming.
They're coming.
The Hammer.
What?
You have to open that gate.
Cut the counterweights.
You can do it. Hurry.
There's no time.
Captain I didn't finish the training program.
-Lock that down!
-Kill the feeder! We won't make it.
We gotta blow the EMP now.
Keep the weight forward.
Holographic reports Captain Mifune's APU is up and moving to Gate Three.
Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three.
-How much time?
-Two minutes to impact.
-Captain Mifune, do you copy?
-I think his radio is down, sir.
Mifune this is Lock.
I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can the Hammer's two minutes away.
You've got two minutes, captain, to get that gate open.
Link.
Neo.
-Can we make it?
-You did it.
We did it.
You're a hell of a pilot. Some things in this world never change.
But some things do?
Luckily some things do.
Link!
I knew you'd come.
You did wear it.
Are you kidding?
Three captains, one ship.
I'll assume the other ships were lost under equally pointless circumstances.
Good to see you too, Jason.
The Council's waiting to hear an explanation. Forgive me for not attending, but I have to try to salvage this debacle.
Did I miss something?
I thought we saved the dock. That's the problem with you people.
You can't think but five minutes in front of you.
That EMP knocked out almost every piece of hardware and every APU.
If I were the machines, I'd send every sentinel here now.
Come on, get it cut.
The bridge is clear.
Do you hear that?
Get that cable run!
-I want the system back online!
-It's the dock. They've got incoming.
Order everyone to fall back.
Seal the shaft.
-All clear.
Your move.
So you gave them your ship?
-That is correct, councillor, I did.
-Knowing what he planned to do with it?
The Oracle said nothing of this?
She told me Neo would need my help, and I would choose to help him or not.
But what hope can a single vessel have against their entire defense system?
It's completely impossible. But he wouldn't listen. He wouldn't even take any ammunition.
He was totally out of his goddamn mind.
No, he wasn't.
Neo is doing what he believes he must do.
I don't know if what he's doing is right.
I don't know if he'll reach the machine city.
And if he does, I don't know what he can do to save us.
But I do know that as long as there is a single breath in his body he will not give up.
We're over the fields, aren't we?
How do you know that?
Over there.
There's our path.
Can you see it?
Three lines. Power lines.
What are they doing?
I don't know.
It is now a matter of time.
The machines will breach the walls of this city.
I recommend that the Council join the non-military personnel inside the temple.
How long do we have?
Maybe less.
My men have fortified the entrance with enough artillery to make our last stand.
Beyond that, there isn't anything more I can do.
Commander, do you think that we have any chance of surviving?
If I were you, I wouldn't ask me that question.
I would ask him. -Why?
There. Those mountains.
-Do you see what's out there? -Yes.
If you tell me we'll make it, I'll believe you.
We'll make it.
Gotcha!
-I need help here!
-I can't beat them.
-What do we do? -Go up, over them.
It's the only way.
Slowly.
Trin? Trinity?
Trinity?
-I'm here.
We made it.
You said we would.
It's unbelievable, Trin.
Light everywhere.
Like the whole thing was built of light.
I wish you could see what I see.
You've already shown me so much.
What is it, Trinity? What's wrong?
I can't go with you, Neo.
What?
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
It's all right.
It's time.
I've done all that I could do.
Now you have to do the rest.
You have to finish it.
You have to save Zion.
I can't.
-Not without you.
-Yes, you can. You will.
I always have.
Trinity.
Trinity, you can't die. You can't.
You can't.
Yes, I can. You brought me back once.
Do you remember on that roof, after you caught me the last thing I said to you?
You said, "I'm sorry. "
I wish I hadn't.
That was my last thought.
I wished I had one more chance to say what really mattered.
To say how much I loved you.
How grateful I was for every moment I was with you. But by the time I knew how to say what I wanted to, it was too late.
But you brought me back.
You gave me my wish.
Kiss me.
Once more kiss me.
Get that ammunition where it belongs!
Neo if you're gonna do something, do it quick.
I only ask to say what I've come to say.
Speak.
The program Smith has grown beyond your control.
He will spread through this city as he spread through the Matrix.
You cannot stop him.
-But I can. -We don't need you!
We need nothing!
What do you want?
What are you doing?
And if you fail?
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.
You like what I've done with the place?
It ends tonight.
I know it does. I've seen it.
That's why the rest of me is just going to enjoy the show because we already know that I'm the one that beats you.
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson closing in on you?
Oh, I can.
I really should thank you for it.
After all, it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life.
Why, Mr. Anderson?
Why, why, why?
Why do you do it?
Why get up? Why keep fighting?
Do you believe you're fighting for something?
For more than your survival?
Do you even know?
Is it freedom or truth?
Perhaps peace?
Could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries of perception.
T emporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose!
And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself although only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love.
You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson.
It's pointless to keep fighting.
Why do you persist?
Wait. I've seen this.
This is it. This is the end.
Yes.
You were laying right there, just like that.
And I....
I stand here, right here, and I'm supposed to say something.
Get away from me!
What are you afraid of?
It's a trick.
You were always right.
It doesn't make sense.
He did it.
He saved us.
He saved us.
It's over!
He did it!
He did it!
He did it!
It's over!
It's over!
He did it!
He did it!
-What is it? What happened? -Sir, he did it, sir.
Neo, he did it. -Did what?
-He ended the war.
The war is over, sir.
The war is over.
Zion!
Zion! Zion, it's over! It's over!
The war is over!
I have imagined this moment for so long.
Neo, wherever you are thank you.
Well, now.
Ain't this a surprise.
You played a very dangerous game. Change always is.
Just how long do you think this peace is going to last?
As long as it can.
What about the others?
What others?
The ones that want out.
Obviously, they will be freed.
I have your word?
We were afraid we might not find you.
Everything's okay now.
Look, look.
Just look at that.
Beautiful.
Did you do that?
For Neo.
That's nice.
I know he'd love it.
Will we ever see him again?
Someday.
Did you always know?
No, I didn't. But I believed.
When I was born, the world was a far simpler place.
It was all just cops and robbers.
Fucking get down!
Get down now!
And you!
Stay down! Stay down!
But it wasn't for me.
Then came the Summer of Love.

Shut the fuck up.

Gene here is Jimmy's right-hand man.
Been with him since way back.

Jimmy trusts him with his life.
By the way, Jimmy would like to see you tomorrow for a spot of lunch.
Wait a minute.
Is there a problem?
Why does everybody assume there's a problem, just because he wants a word?

The business is on the up and up.
But I've always said, have a plan and stick to it.
Quit while you're ahead.
So barring any fuck-ups, I'm leaving it all behind.
No, we got the parcel.
Yeah, better than expected, actually.
It's just that things have gone a little bit slightly turbo this end.
Come on, boys, lively, lively.
If we miss this tide, we're not going anywhere till daylight.
Paul, you ain't being paid to moan.
You're being paid to get my cargo home.
Come on, babe.
You all right?
Careful here, it's a bit wobbly.
Life is so fucking good, I can taste it in my spit.
I'll treat tomorrow's lunch like a Last Supper, feign interest in his tales.
And then leave quietly forever.
This is pure class.
Please, follow me, gentlemen.
Mr Price is in the Oval Room.
- Your guests, Mr Price.
- Thanks, Angelo.
Welcome. Sit down.
How is it with that Paki accountant I put your way?
- He still doing the business?
- Raj is doing a very good job.
Good.
Paying your bit of straight-goer's tax, eh?
We all have to do our bit.
Say hello from me next time you see him.
You hungry?
The grub here will make your bollocks tingle.
Let's eat.
Right.
We've gotta test the snap-crackle-and-pop factor on these babies.
Don't ask me.
I ain't fucking touching 'em.
You are a miserable bastard, you really are.
- Brian.
- What?
Sit down, mate.
Got a little treat for you.
Help yourself.
A little privacy, please, Angelo.
What do you want, son?
- Excuse me?
- In life.
What are you after?
A shot at the title?
A seat by the band?
Well, I don't know, Mr Price.
That's a very expansive question.
Right, expansive. Good answer.
Years ago, people would've thought you were a homosexual, using a word like "expansive" .
- You're not a homosexual, are you?
- Not behind with the rent?
- No.
No, I didn't think you were.
No harm in it, I suppose.
Times change.
You know why people like you can't leave this business?
Because you make too much money for people like me.
Anyway, I'll get to the point.
I need a favour.
I need someone who's a bit cute, a smooth operator.
Not a two-a-penny loud-mouth. Too many grasses around.
- It would be a pleasure, Mr Price.
- Jimmy.
You can call me Jimmy.
Now, this favour.
It's not for me, truth be told.
It's for a good friend of mine.
Like a blood-brother.
We were at school together.
Now he's a right wheeler-dealer.
Flinging up skyscrapers.
His wife's a proper blue blood.
I'll give you a clue.
Eddie Temple.
Does that name mean anything to you?
- I know who you mean.
- Now, Eddie's got a daughter.
Charlie, bless her.
The light of his life.
He worships the ground she walks on.
She's a proper beauty, Charlie.
Or to give her her correct moniker, Charlie Spencer-Temple.
But she ain't behaving like a lady.
She's hooked on the white powder and loves a wrong 'un.
This is where you come in, right?
You're gonna find her.
- Find her?
- She's gone missing.
Well, you should get a private detective.
Oh, right.
Some nosy ex-policeman, still on the Scotland Yard payroll?
She's done a runner from a drug rehabilitation unit in the West Country.
Rehab.
She got loved up in there with some fucking low-life crackhead called Kinky.
I reckon they've gone back to London.
I wouldn't know where to begin.
Now and then we're asked to do something beyond the call of duty.
It's called sacrifice, son.
Ask Gene. Ask Morty.
- I'll do my best.
- You do your best and find her.
Keep Mr McGuire posted.
I've also got a little business more in your usual line.
Gene'll fill you in.
Everything was to your satisfaction?
- Fucking excellent, Angelo.
- Thank you.
" Details, details.
Things to do, things to get done.
" Don't bother me with details.
Just tell me when they're done."
- Who said that, son?
- Winston Churchill?
Close.
No, I said it.
James Lionel Price.
Good boy.
I'll see you at the yard tomorrow.
Say, four.
Tell you about that bit of business.
I've set up a meet for five with the Duke.
- What's with him?
- He's just had one of these.
These are super Es.
We'll make millions!
I don't care.
This is my boat-yard.
I want those pills and that fucking idiot out of here now.
- I can't afford to get nicked.
- Paul.
Calm down, mate.
I've got Gene coming down with a buyer.
You'll be in your whack.
Here, chill.
Have a pill.
Gene, why are we doing business with the Duke?
Yeah, why are we dealing with this joker?
He's a fucking maniac, a relic, a throw-back, belongs to the Dark Ages.
Will you just shut the fuck up?
We're dealing with him because he has 1 million Ecstasy pills of very high levels of MDMA, OK?
One million?
Gene, that is a lot of pills.
What's the tax on that?
Jimmy wants 50%/ netto.
Love a bit of cloak-and-dagger, this lot.
Oh, yeah.
Driving a bright yellow Range Rover.
Very subtle.
Calm down.
You'll feel better once you've got your money.
But how much can you spend in Parkhurst or the Scrubs, Gene?
Come on.
Oh, don't go getting Duke at it.
Jimmy doesn't want him fucked about, OK?
Who?
Me?
Don't you fucking talk to me like I'm some kind of mug.
Duke, don't take this personally.
It's business.
You want to know how much they're worth.
Yes!
Fucking!
Please!
Just because you pay a fiver a pop down the local cattle market, don't, for fuck's sake, think these pills are worth millions.
They're not.
We've got to find a buyer.
They've got to split them into parcels.
They've got to find these people.
You'd give a fucking aspirin a headache, pal.
Then you've got currency fluctuations, police activity, adverse publicity.
Who has got the readies lying around to pay for a million Es?
- This is fucking bollocks!
- Slasher, shut the fuck up!
- Duke, we all want a good deal.
- Mate, mate, mate.
Mate, look, that parcel of pills has got to be worth five million easy.
- £5 each, yeah!
- You are fucking joking.
It doesn't work like that!
Don't keep fucking saying that to me!
I've got some samples.
I'll stay in touch through Gene, OK?
You wouldn't be so fucking flash if you didn't have him behind you.
Yeah, well, he fucking has, ain't he?
Where did these monkeys get a million Es?
Don't worry about that.
Can you place them?
We know someone up North who'll buy.
Morty, set up a meeting with Trevor and Shanks in Liverpool.
What's really bothering me is what colour to get the Aston.
As you're driving it yourself, probably green.
- Green?
- Yeah.
That's a trifle dull, I thought.
What do you think, girls?
Black.
Yeah, black.
Black's the colour for a hearse or a taxi.
Don't be so conservative.
Black's a splendid idea.
Hello. Look who it is.
Sit down.
Do join us.
- Can we have a word?
- Our dreary broker has arrived.
Hugo, follow me.
Don't go anywhere.
Drink some more champagne.
Especially you.
I like it when you're drunk.
- You're the master of that.
- What are you up to?
We're doing the number on these American birds.
- Who am I today?
- The Earl of Oxford.
- The Earl of Oxford.
- What's this business, then?
- It's a bit strange.
Can you find somebody for me really quickly?
- How quickly?
- 20 grand quickly.
You've got our attention.
Oh, very nice.
I suppose this is the boyfriend?
It's a bit unusual for you.
What's going on?
- It doesn't matter.
Can you do it? - Yeah.
Should be a doddle.
All the same, junkies and crackheads.
Chuck 'em a few quid, they'll cough.
- Is there anything else?
We must get back to work, old boy.
Look...
All right, mate.
I'm the Duke's nephew.
Remember me?
Sidney.
Sidney.
Yes.
Hello, mate. How are you?
I'm just off.
Have a nice night.
How you doing?
What you doing here?
I hear you're doing business with my uncle, the Duke.
Why don't you tell the whole fucking room?
- This is Tammy.
- Who's your mate, Sidney?
He's a good mate of my uncle's, the Duke.
He was just going.
Yeah, well stick around and have a drink before you do, yeah?
- Yeah, all right.
- I got VIP down here. Nice little booth.
Charisma, he's fucking got it.
I know he's my uncle and all that, but you can't deny it.
If you want anything, just tell me, 'cause I got 'em straightened out in here.
If you want any running about, I'm your man...
- Line?
- What?
I said do you want a line?
No, mate.
You knock yourself out.
Lovely, isn't she?
Isn't she a darling?
Isn't she?
Siddy, baby, I could do with a livener.
Sidney, it's been great.
I'll see you, man.
Thanks for the champagne.
All right.
You let me know when you're happy, Mr Lucky.
- Too warm down your way?
- We're kept busy, Trevor.
- Everyone wants a slice as well.
- Same wherever you go.
Greedy people.
Yeah, it's all clear, Shanks.
You lot would know all about that, wouldn't you?
What the fuck's that, Shanks?
Well, not you lot, but that team down your end.
No offence, but what the fuck are you talking about?
You really do surprise me, do you know that?
Do you know something we don't?
Don't be giving it the big fucking innocent, pal.
Because I am not a fucking prick.
- I never said you were, Shanks.
- Cool it, Shanks.
They really don't know.
- Explain.
- I was over in Amsterdam.
Last weekend, right?
The whole place is alight with a rumour about how this hooligan outfit from down your end, run by this joker called the Duke...
- Gazza, go and find them fucking pills.
- All right. Come on.
Have a look in here.
They skank ed this outfit, a proper, nutty Serbian militia.
You're the first person ever to be foolish enough to steal from me.
Shut up.
But you're not the first to point a gun at me.
Shut up or I'll be the last.
Fuck me. They got lucky.
He'd just knock ed up a massive batch.
Fucking jackpot.
There's fucking millions of the fuckers in here.
Stay down there. Yes?
You watch them.
- That looks very heavy for you, darling.
- Why don't you put it down?
- Why don't you shut up?
- A little girl playing games with guns.
- I ain't no little girl.
Shut up!
- You are shaking.
- Look at your arm.
- Fuck off!
- Put it down.
- Why don't you listen to me?
- Sit down!
- Fuck off!
Baby, baby, baby, baby!
Come here. Come here.
Baby, calm down, calm down.
This will not be the end of this, Mr Duke, believe me.
Gazza, go and load them pills.
But he got unlucky because this lot are wanted for fucking war crimes.
Mass murder, ethnic cleansing.
They're lunatics.
They're wanted by the United fucking Nations.
Think about that.
Let's get this clear.
Duke has absolutely sweet fuck-all to do with us, understand?
Everyone in Amsterdam believes that he has.
- Bandied your names about.
- What?
Word on the straat is they've unleashed their top boy. His name is...
His party piece, right, is lopping people's heads off then fetching them back to his boss.
It's all about honour and respect with these head-banging nationalist outfits.
They can't have it getting about that anybody has took liberties with them.
But we had nothing to do with the acquiring of said merchandise.
OK, we accept that.
But with you lot up here punting this shipment, how does it look?
Bad.
You do know that we're only talking pennies an article?
- Stolen goods.
- You won't want them, then.
Sit down, lah. Let's not be too hasty.
Me and him need to have a little think.
Don't think too long.
Someone's gonna make a killing on these pills.
They already have.
That's the problem, kidder.
That prick Duke's made us look a bunch of fucking amateurs.
I told you he was trouble.
But he ain't gonna drag me down with him.
Try Gene again.
What a fucking show-up!
- He's not answering, Mort.
Try Jimmy at home.
- You sure?
- Will you fucking ring him?
- Where are we going, Morty?
- Back to that boat-yard.
- Somebody's about to get a fucking slap.
- Yes, Morty.
About fucking time.
Paul?
What a way to go.
An iron burning a hole in your chest until your heart boils.
Paulie would've told him anything, then, wouldn't he?
You see, that's what happens when you do business with loons.
Clarkie, have a sniff about.
Make some phone calls, but really quietly.
Find out where the Duke's holed up.
We're gonna need an insurance policy.
What's the fucking idea of phoning me at home and leaving messages, you prick!
- Jimmy, it was an emergency.
- Don't fucking call me Jimmy!
And what's the idea of telling Duke those pills ain't worth shit?
You don't know the problems you've caused.
And don't be leaving it to that pair of ponces, Cody and Tiptoes, to find that bitch Charlie.
I fucking told you to do it!
Are you listening?
Find a buyer for those pills.
The person moving those pills met a nasty end.
I don't give a fuck!
- That was quick.
- The gaff is rotten in there.
- Kinky's still here, isn't he?
- Didn't Tiptoes tell you?
Tell me what?
Have you let him go?
No, I haven't.
He's in here.
Kinky.
I still want to be paid.
So, if I'm correct, you three gearheads are gonna be clucking very soon.
In fact, you're gonna be climbing the walls any minute, aren't you?
But I'm prepared to do you a favour.
We can do this one of two ways.
We can do it the nice way, which I think you'll prefer.
Because the other way is my friend takes you and puts your head through the window!
Right, so, was Charlie here with Kinky?
Yeah, she was here for a couple of days.
Kinky turned up with five grand.
- Who's giving Kinky five grand?
- We don't know.
They k ept arguing.
She was saying, "Do you think it's that easy
"taking the five grand?" But she was still caning the rocks.
Where is she now?
Brighton.
She kept begging Kinky to go with her.
The other night, I hears this noise.
I'm looking out there.
It's dark.
But I sees this geezer all in black.
It's like something out of a kung-fu film.
- Pay no attention to him.
He's a nutter. - Shut the fuck up.
And you, fucking tell him now.
What geezer?
I don't know.
I goofed out myself.
The next morning, she's gone and Kinky's dead.
You telling me that somebody's topped Kinky?
Kinky overdosed.
He always was a greedy fucker.
I saw it with my own eyes, man.
You smoke too much of that fucking crack!
Shut the fuck up! - You twat!
- Shut the fuck up!
Get the fucking money!
Morty!
Morty!
This is dodgy.
That kid's talking about murder.
He's talking shit.
Get to Brighton and finish the job.
- It all smells a bit fishy.
- I'll double your money.
- All right.
And ten G for finding Kinky.
- That wasn't the fucking deal.
- Yes or no?
- Yes.
Hello.
Ambulance, please.
185 Kirby House, Kings Cross.
There's a dead boy.
The door's open.
My name...?
185 Kirby House.
I'm not happy.
This shit is out of control.
You sort it out or I'll sort you out.
Morty, Kinky OD'd, that's all.
Charlie woke up, found him cold, freaked out, fucked off down to Brighton.
Cody's gonna find her.
Look, I'm gonna freshen these teas up.
They're cold.
Morty?
Is that you?
Where you been hiding, then, eh?
What you doing down this neck of the woods?
Hello, Freddie.
So Mr Mortimer.
Here, Morty, couldn't spare us a few quid, for old times' sake?
You look well flush, bruv.
Fuck me, he's loaded.
Here, couldn't make it five, could you mate?
- Let's make it ten.
- Yeah.
Ten's a nice round number.
What's the matter?
What's happening?
Been away? Yeah.
Ten fucking years.
Going off? Or do you need a red light?
Stop, Morty. Enough. He's had enough.
- I'll tell you when he's had enough.
- What the fuck is this?
But let's forget about all that.
Let's have a cup of tea, Mr Hurst.
What the fuck?
I'm sorry about that.
I won't be around for a while.
- It's me.
- Hey.
Come on up.
I'll leave the door open.
- How's your day been so far?
- Very fucking funny.
Have you eaten?
I'll have a Chinky sent up.
No, I'm fine, thank you.
Gene, who the fuck is Freddie?
He used to run with me, Morty and Jimmy in this real kamikaze firm.
In those days, we were headed up by this guy called Crazy Larry.
Yeah.
Got shot, didn't he?
Bit of a lunatic.
That's an understatement.
They were a spun-out bunch.
Always doing loads of drugs.
- Not worried about k eeping a low profile.
- I love you.
Turn over anyone who couldn't go to the law.
No fucking problem.
Boys will be boys.
Until one of them, Kilburn Jerry shoots himself stone dead.
This is a bit of a dilemma.
This desperate posse can't call the law or an ambulance.
Morty, out of some mad fucking sense of loyalty, actually v olunteered to dispose of the body.
No head.
But things went a bit wrong.
The guy Larry told to help him was Freddie Hurst.
The total imbecile had fallen asleep at some traffic lights in a drunk en, drug-induced stupor.
Morty was still shut up in the van with the headless body of Kilburn Jerry.
Being black was even worse than being Irish.
They threw the book at Morty.
Freddie got three years for aiding and abetting.
Morty did ten years because Freddie Hurst fell asleep?
But he kept his mouth shut.
Did his bird.
Earned a lot of respect for that.
All because some kid was being ridden against his will by a psychotic lunatic.
- Who?
- But you, you fuck!
- Crazy Larry was gay.
- He was never gay.
- Larry used to say...
- Fucking females is for puffs.
So who shot Crazy Larry?
A boyfriend?
Probably.
Larry made enemies very easy.
Took liberties with too many straight lads.
Not for me.
Listen, son.
Let me explain something to you.
Freddie's in intensive care with a bit of a brain haemorrhage.
You were there at the scene.
That's called joint venture.
Now, if Freddie dies, you're either in the dock with Morty or you're in the witness box putting him away.
Think about that.
You know, I will have one of those.
- All right, fellas?
- Where's Duke?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.
I thought he was here. - Well, go and fucking find him.
He's probably having a night out while us mugs babysit these.
Gene, what the fuck am I gonna do about these Serbs?
Come here.
I have something for you.
- You're gonna need one of these.
- Fuck me, Gene.
I fucking hope not.
Are you trying to scare the shit out of me?
I mean, I fucking hate guns.
Although that one is really pretty.
Is that Second World War?
Hey, point it upwards.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Here, let me see if it's loaded.
You look like you could do that blindfolded.
I can and I do.
I find it very relaxing.
Good for meditation.
Meditation is concentrating the front of the mind with a mundane task so the rest of the mind can find peace.
And you find peace with guns.
Well, on occasion.
It has been known.
Listen. I know it's not your thing.
But if you ever have to kill somebody, never, ever tell a living soul.
- Who is this?
- My name is Dragan.
How did you get this number?
Boatman Paul gave me your number, in the end.
I believe you have some property that belongs to my employer, and you're the person I should talk to about the return of this cargo, stolen by your associate, the Duk e.
Dragan, the Duke is nothing to do with me.
Mr Duk e came to Amsterdam, used your name, said he work ed for you.
- Are you listening?
- Dragan...
I've got an idea. Why don't you come round for breakfast?
I'll squeeze some orange juice and we'll talk about this like adults.
- How does that sound?
- Sounds very hospitable.
- Do you know where I live?
- No.
Well, fuck off, then.
Duk e's gone missing.
He's a fucking liability.
The pigs are everywhere.
This was meant to be easy.
No sweat.
Calm down, Gazza.
I'm sure Duke's just fine.
Well, you've got 48 hours to find a buyer or I'm sending 'em back, OK?
Now, listen.
Don't do anything stupid, Gazza.
It ain't worth the grief.
We've gone underground, off the radar.
Nothing personal, but I don't trust you.
Listen, I just had a phone call from Gazza.
Being a cry-baby.
Threatening to offload those pills in 48 hours.
Between you and that gobshite Duke, he's promised Jimmy a bumper pay-day.
- So get busy.
- I said to Jimmy I'd try and...
He put yous together.
You and Duke.
That's his job.
If you two can't make music, he's gonna want his whack out either way.
That's business.
- I hope you put this Dragan straight.
- Yeah. I told him to fuck off. What?
Please tell me you're fucking joking.
Well, I am beginning to regret it now.
We've got to find the Duke, find these fucking pills.
We can't rely on these monkeys to call Gene.
We've looked everywhere.
There's no sign.
You can't find any of his firm?
Maybe this Dragan geezer's already found the Duke and done the business.
Yeah, well, there is someone I can call.
Keep looking.
Wait.
You're gonna leave it to us?
This Dragan geezer is phoning me.
I am the target.
And if we don't find the Duke, this, everything, all over.
- It's me.
Sidney's mate.
- Oh, hiya.
- What took you so long to call?
- I've been busy.
- You sound sleepy.
You just woken up?
- Not long ago.
- So when am I gonna see you?
- What are you doing now?
Nothing.
No, I was just lying in bed, wondering what to do.
- You still in bed?
- Yeah.
- You lying there naked?
- I've got a little T-shirt on.
But that's all.
Here, wait, listen to this.
What's that?
I was just rubbing the phone against my fanny.
Did you lik e it?
My, oh my, it's fresh this morning.
Look at my nipples, standing up like little soldiers.
What is a girl to do?
Tammy, why don't we meet up now?
I'll book a table for lunch.
St Martin's Hotel.
Don't worry about a table.
- Yeah, OK.
- One hour.
Hang on.
Oh, shit.
Oh, leave it off, Sidney.
He's driving me fucking mad.
- We're not expecting Sidney, are we?
- He's too busy kissing Duke's arse.
Not round here, I hope.
No, over by Greenwich market.
So you can relax.
It's just the two of us.
Patience.
All good things come to those who wait.
Stay put.
Hello, it's me.
It's me.
Shut up and listen.
Sidney, Duke's nephew is working down by Greenwich Market.
Go and look.
- Room service.
- Look for that yellow Range Rover.
OK.
- Your champagne, sir.
- I didn't order...
One moment, Mr Troop.
I want to hear what this bastard has to say for himself.
I'm Jimmy's old colleague, Eddie Temple.
- He told you to locate my daughter.
Hunt her down like some lost mongrel.
He said you asked for his help.
Mr Troop could find anyone on the planet in ten minutes flat.
If you'd laid a finger on my daughter, you'd be over the edge like that.
You'd join that shit, Kinky, who thought he could take my five grand and fuck me over.
The audacity.
How fucking dare you?
I've known Jimmy Price for 45 years.
It pays me to keep an eye on him.
Do you know what a remora fish is?
- Yes.
- Oh, you do?
Well, Jimmy has been swimming in my slipstream all my fucking life.
I thought he might put some volatile psychopath on the job.
But I've checked you out, son.
You're a smart boy.
But you keep very, very bad company.
You know, I host a charity golf tournament every year.
Quite an event in the social calendar, if I do say so myself.
I like to invite Jimmy.
Some of my friends find him absurdly hilarious.
Drinks are on me.
Drinks for everyone.
Champagne.
But I've come unstuck in my attempts to provide a spectacle for my chums.
Jimmy, as usual on the look out for titbits, has met the development minister of some tin-pot republic.
They're trawling the West for investments.
They have vast natural resources.
Quite an investment for the right man.
They've sent in men from Timbuktu explaining all the details.
Profits, shares, long-term investments, short-term investments.
They've even made him an honorary citizen.
Even made him one of the tribe.
What we didn't know, until it all ended in tears, was that the hard-line communist insurgents who control the country outside the mining areas...
Bad news about our little venture, Jim.
The communists have broken through.
Heading for the capital with little resistance.
What the fuck are you on about?
I got word they were planning a push.
The final coup de grâce. I told Jimmy.
- It's all over.
- Fuck's sake!
- Keep your voice down.
- Get my money out quick, now.
As if it was some little kiddie's piggy bank.
Now, I explained that wasn't possible.
We thought we'd bought a government.
Maybe someone made a better offer.
Forget about it.
You win some, you lose some.
How much are we talking?
It's only a cheeky half-mill, Jim.
- It's much more than that.
- How much?
- 13.
- 13 what?
- 13 million pounds.
I'm fucked.
- Have you gone fucking mad?
13 million pounds!
You've been right grafted, royally turned over.
- Like some Yank buying London Bridge.
- Don't talk to me like that.
He accused me of instigating it.
It's no coincidence I met them at your tournament.
Are you fucking demented?
Asked me to fly to Zurich to see the minister, still parked up in La Maison Grande, still eating well.
Big fat fucker.
On little Jimmy's nest egg.
Jimmy thought he'd keep Charlotte hostage while you went to get his money.
Little Jimmy was so stupid, he thought he couldn't lose either way.
I'm sorry, what?
If you find Charlotte, he's got his hostage.
If I find you trying to find her,
I do his dirty work.
- I'm still not with you.
- Your lives are inextricably linked.
I've found out something very interesting about Jimmy, something I've long suspected.
But I'll let Jimmy explain.
You follow me.
You've no doubt suffered Jimmy's
" CID was geezers you was at school with" routine?
The other chap's Albert Carter.
Another twisted bastard from the old neighbourhood.
Member of the Regional Crime Squad.
Sit back, relax and enjoy.
It ain't lik e your lot in the old days.
- They've all gone squeaky.
- Tell me about it, Jim.
I have to box clever with those college boys from Anti-Corruption.
- Fucking dogs. Slags.
- It's the going rate, Jim.
Ten K. Hardly seems worth the bother.
Well, there's only so much in those informer funds.
What about Gene? Does he suspect anything?
What?
About me working for the old firm?
Listen.
Gene is too loyal for his own good.
- I don't fucking believe it.
- You better believe it.
- 'Cause it's fucking happening.
- Where did you get this?
Mr Troop made it for me.
- It's one of his little hobbies.
- I don't fucking believe it.
Don't you want to hear what Jimmy has to say about you?
I've got one for you.
Pluck ed and ready for the pot.
- Just give us a name and he's gone.
- In time.
I don't want a bunce.
I want him out of the way.
Flash young runt.
One of the new breed, ain't he?
Reck ons he can just waltz off into retirement.
I want him away for 12.
If he's got a kilo of class A, he's looking at double figures.
- I'll put it there myself.
- Sounds personal.
He's got a few quid .
He'll come in handy.
I set him up with that slippery accountant in the first place.
Fucking rag-head let slip, didn't he?
"You will miss him when he's gone, Mr Price. "
Is that you, the flash runt who thinks he's retiring?
You'd no idea what Jimmy was up to?
How do you think these fuckers earn a living?
I would've thought a smart young man like you would know that already.
- Can I have that?
- Mr Troop.
Thank you.
This looks like you, son.
Smart part of town.
I'll keep an eye open. Must dash off.
Get home.
Wash and brush up.
Opera tonight.
Man sells his soul to the devil. All ends in tears.
These arrangements usually do.
One more thing, young man.
Always remember, the art of good business is being a good middleman.
Bye-bye.
- I've got him.
- Got who?
Sidney, remember?
Yellow Range Rover?
Seems they sent our friend out for something to eat.
Good.
Tell Morty.
- So what do we do now?
- Call Morty.
Shut up and listen.
No more insults, no more games.
If I do not get my cargo back, you're a dead man.
Dragan, I've been doing some checking.
- I've found out who you represent.
- Good.
I can point you towards your boss's merchandise.
- Come to my hotel...
- Look...
- I'd rather meet you in a public place.
- You have nothing to fear.
- I'm a reasonable man.
- That's not what I've heard.
I'll meet you at...
I'll meet you at Greenwich Park Observatory.
- Any taxi will drop you off.
- I can read a map.
- Tomorrow.
Midday.
- Tomorrow at 12.
I'll be there.
That's rude, Mr Dragan.
It's Conditions Red down there.
They're didgy as fuck.
They haven't moved from that lock-up.
Have a look at the geezer at the front, on the door.
I know him from somewhere.
This could get messy.
What about the blokes in red?
Mechanics.
They got a ringing coup going on.
The lorries come in one colour, go out another.
But they're nothing to do with the Duke.
- Fuck me, look who it isn't.
- Who's that?
It doesn't matter.
I've got work to do. - Stay here.
Those pills move, call me.
- You got it.
- Day and night, Terry.
- What do you mean " night"?
- I've been here all day.
Get Clarkie. - Day and fucking night. Got it?
Hello, young man.
Thank you for coming at such short notice.
I hope you didn't feel too summoned.
How are you?
I'm in the best of health, Mr Temple. Thank you for asking.
- How are you keeping?
- I'm very well.
- How was the performance of Faust?
- Complex. No wonder it took him 60 years to write it.
How's the family?
What is this?
A vicar's tea party?
You do sometimes take your conversations away with you.
Being a clever bastard, are we?
- How do I know you're not wired up?
- Well, I'm not.
Then we'll have to trust each other, won't we?
Sit down.
I've been thinking, after our chat the other day.
Your pills. How much for the lot?
No, I've already got a buyer. Nearly took my hand off.
He's putting the money together now.
I told you, lah.
I'm still thinking.
It's only been three days.
What's the fucking hurry?
- What's he paying?
- It's confidential.
Don't be an idiot.
Let me match his offer.
They've got history.
Bad juju.
And, anyway, this Serbian maniac's in hot pursuit.
If I sold them to you, I'd have to disappoint him.
And he is definitely not...
I did you a big fucking favour letting you know about Jimmy.
I think you owe me.
2½ million in sterling and euros, high-denomination used notes.
So if I gave you three million, that would keep everyone happy.
Let me state my position.
You can sell these pills to whoever you like.
That's your privilege.
That's your business.
But I'll tell you,
I'll be very, very unhappy if you don't sell 'em to me.
You understand?
OK, Mr Temple.
Three million. Done.
- My buyer's not gonna be happy, though.
- Fuck him.
He'll get over it.
I'm gonna need some help.
Someone who can eliminate the problem.
Someone who's a bit handy. Whoa!
Slow down, kidder.
Mr Lucky does a drop of freelance work.
I don't need to know.
It's none of my business.
You tell him when, and he'll come down on the train.
Thanks, Trev.
Excuse me.
Mr Temple.
You deliver them to my warehouse.
When do I get my consignment? Monday.
No, Tuesday, probably.
Tuesday?
I'm paying over the odds, remember?
England!
Typical.
Even drug dealers don't work weekends.
That's good news.
That should cheer Gene up.
Yeah, everything's under control. - Cody's been chasing his ten grand.
- Yeah.
I'll call him later.
- Hey, Geno, what's up?
- Got some good news.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
- You murdering bastard!
- Open the fucking door!
- Stay out of this, Morty.
- Gene!
- Murder?
Who's dead?
- Jimmy.
He killed him.
Blew his fucking head away.
- Open this fucking door!
Open this fucking door!
- Get off him.
- No, listen, listen.
Just listen.
Listen to me, Morty.
I got a call from a cozzer we've got bent.
They found Jimmy's body last night.
In his own backyard.
It was this sly bastard.
He's no killer. Somebody's made a mistake.
All right, look.
Here. We'll see. Read it.
Read it out loud.
"To senior ranks only.
Murder Squad investigation.
James Lionel Price."
Read the fucking ballistics report.
" Preliminary ballistics report.
No arms recovered. Disintegrated on impact.
"One recovered cartridge casing."
You forgot to take the cartridge case.
You got sloppy.
" ...consistent with weapon used
" in unsolved homicide of Lawrence Gower aka Crazy Larry Flynn."
Wait. I got it.
Whoever killed Crazy Larry must've killed Jimmy.
No, no. The gun.
The fucking gun was the same.
The one he stole from my flat.
- You killed Crazy Larry?
- So?
- This fucker killed Jimmy.
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Why did you do it?
- He was an informer.
- He was a police informer!
- Jimmy a grass?
Are you fucking mad?
- You'll have to do better than that.
- I've got a recording at home.
Of Jimmy and a cozzer called Albie Carter.
Gene, let's listen to this shit.
If he's lying, we'll both fucking kill him.
Mr Mortimer reck ons the Tylers are bringing in shooters from Jamaica via Manchester.
They got someone in Immigration straightened out.
I don't think anybody gives a fuck about spades shooting spades.
Don't you care about dead darkies, Albert?
What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything? What?
About me working for the old firm?
Convinced?
You don't fuck about, do you?
Jimmy was skint, huh?
That's why he set up the whole Amsterdam business with Duke.
I really think we should keep all of this to ourselves, right?
Really?
Why did you kill Larry?
Funnily enough, it was Jimmy who persuaded me.
Jimmy never lik ed Larry.
Look at that wrong 'un waving his money around.
It ain't right.
Hey, I love you, man.
He saw the future was drugs and it needed to be run like a business.
Crazy Larry was no fucking businessman.
After that business with Kilburn Jerry...
That's it, son.
You do him. Bollocks!
...he wanted him gone.
I didn't have any problem doing him.
That's why I did it.
But why did you keep the gun?
Sounds silly now, but it was my favourite.
I hope you don't tell the other guns you've got favourites.
So what's the next move, boss?
Well, I'm going to bed.
I don't know what you two are doing.
We can talk about it tomorrow.
Sorry?
Sorry, mate, what was that?
Would you pack that in?
I've got a fucking test next week. OK.
OK, I'm sorry.
I was just saying...
So when does the target get here, then?
The target?
The target's gonna be here at exactly midday.
Where?
- Here, right fucking here.
- Got a photo?
- Don't worry about it. - Who's worried?
I'll have some binoculars.
I'll give you a little signal.
I could get the 13.10 home from here.
Let's have a little recce.
After we do the business, walk slowly back.
Remember, it's a stroll in the park.
Don't run, whatever you do.
The first five minutes, nobody'll have a clue what's going on.
Hopefully, it'll be mayhem.
So try to stay relaxed.
Don't do anything to draw attention to yourself.
Or me.
Afterwards, take me to the Underground station.
I'll look after myself.
There.
Time?
Six minutes to twelve.
I hope he's not gonna be late.
- Maybe he'll be early. - That'll be nice.
Can you see that guy on the left?
- Big fella, marching up the hill.
- That's our man.
- Are you sure? - For fuck's sake.
I'm gonna call him. It's up to you.
You're the client.
- As soon as he answers, he's gone, OK?
- Okey-dokey.
Stand by.
Now.
Hello, may I help you?
Don't move a muscle.
- Do I have your attention?
- Yes.
You English, you have no idea of honour and respect.
I usually kill for less.
I want my cargo and the Duk e.
I haven't got your pills.
Just give me a day.
Don't piss in my pock et and tell me it's raining.
Now listen for the last time. - You'll bring me what is mine.
- Look, I don't...
Jesus!
You have one more day.
See you tomorrow at dusk by the statue.
Remember, I will be watching you.
What the fuck were you thinking?
Getting Trevor's man down here to shoot this Serb in a park!
Trevor's gonna go ballistic.
Now, what the fuck do I tell him?
- What a fucking mess. - You've gone mad.
- Think you're a gangster?
- Fuck off! You want to play?
You do it somewhere else.
If you do it near me, I'll put you in a fucking wheelchair.
Stick to your fucking sums.
Listen. Listen to me.
Dragan's killed Paul.
He's done the Duke.
He's just put a bullet between Lucky's eyes.
I was there!
He's watching our every move. Who's next, me?
- I wish.
- Fuck off!
It could've been you or Morty.
Dragan said he wanted the pills and the Duke.
What?
I should've told you this earlier.
Duke and Slasher came by the office the other day.
Paul the boatman was topped last night.
I've got to get on my toes sharpish.
I want Jimmy brought here right now, yeah?
Getting that smug fucking yuppie bastard to tell Duke those pills were useless, after sending us over in the first place.
Hang on, you've lost me now.
If you have us over, I swear by fucking almighty God, I'll call the fucking law.
- What are you talking about?
- I'll call the law. She didn't mean that.
She's upset.
Shut the fuck up!
That's where playing at being a gangster gets you.
You're not in there 'cause I like you.
I'm beginning to feel left out.
Why?
Freddie Hurst is still in intensive care after your jolly little reunion the other day.
Fucking hell, Duke.
For once, you might be of some use.
That was Gazza on the phone.
It's on.
He'll pick you up at nine in the morning.
Gallows Corner.
You know it?
Yeah.
With Jimmy gone, these pills will make a nice contribution to my retirement fund, so don't fuck things up again, OK?
If you do, you'll wish this Dragan had shot you between the eyes, understand?
Best of luck.
Thanks.
Fuck off!
Sidney, I've told you, stop answering my phone, OK?
- Who was it?
- Wrong number.
- All right? - Hello, Sidney.
- How you doing, then?
- I'm all right.
How are you?
I'm all right, mate, yeah.
Gazza, this place stinks.
We want to get you out of here. 50 pence a pill.
That way, we all come out with something.
- I think they're worth more than that.
- This is a reality check.
Paul's dead, Jimmy's dead.
Duke and Slasher, fuck knows where they are.
This gear is knock-off, and the Serbs you nicked it from, they'd kill you like you'd take a piss.
Gazza, the Old Bill are outside!
- Gazza, no!
- Go, go, go! - Let's have it!
- Don't point that gun at me.
- Put it down!
- We're going in! Gazza, look at me.
Put it down.
You're gonna get us all shot.
Fuck it!
Boat!
Stay there!
Come on!
- Gazza, wait!
- Fucking hurry up, then!
Get in.
Is this for me?
Yes.
Your cargo's gone, I'm afraid.
- It was seized by...
- I know already.
- How do you know?
- I watched.
I don't believe this.
Captain's gonna go fucking spare!
We are in shit.
You lot have fucked up again.
Leave it to me, lads.
I'll explain to Inspector Cox that his suspect has scarpered 'cause of your blundering.
Knobheads.
Helmets off.
Does this settle things, then?
Tango Foxtrot, over.
Delta Uniform...
How did that other errand go?
Success, as far as I could make out.
Where is my fucking prisoner?
- You old ladies couldn't catch a cold.
- Sir, I just...
Shut up, you soppy wanker.
- Indigo...
- Dingo Bongo.
- Is this area now secure?
- Yes, sir.
You can fuck off, then.
So where are the pills, genius?
I think this is them now.
What the fuck?
- Couldn't leave this behind. - Greenies.
You are in the wrong game. You should work with us.
- Are we square?
- Yeah, we're sweet.
It seems so.
Your pills are in the back.
Help yourself.
Hello.
OK. Yes, I will do.
Bye-bye.
You're off the hook, Morty.
Freddie Hurst is out of his coma.
Good news.
- Yeah.
- Good news, mate.
Listen, I've got one for you.
Irishman caught his son snorting charlie.
He said, " If I catch you doing that again, I'll rub your fucking nose in it."
- Do you have the pills?
- In the cars.
Boss wants to see you in his office.
Come in.
Sit down.
Here you are.
Payment.
- You look shocked, son.
- Are you taking the fucking piss?
You and Jimmy have caused my little angel Charlotte considerable anxiety.
She's off to Arizona for a course of intense treatment.
I'm keeping those pills for myself, by way of compensation.
I think I'm entitled. Simple. End of.
The amount of trouble you've caused the last few days.
Jimmy.
Poor little Jimmy.
It would be in your interests if this thing finishes here, now, today.
Understand?
It doesn't matter what I do. This lot are gonna come after you.
They're too long in the tooth to rampage round the country, looking for revenge.
Look at 'em.
Bunch of under-endowed, ageing fuck pigs.
Are you enjoying this?
No.
On the contrary.
Take it as a compliment.
You're a bright young man.
This monkey business is in your blood, under your skin.
You're not getting out, you're just getting in.
I've every faith in you.
One day, it will be you sitting here telling some young Turk the facts of life.
And they are, Mr Temple?
You're born, you take shit.
Get out in the world, you take more shit.
Climb a little higher, you take less shit.
Until one day, you're up in the rarefied atmosphere, and you've forgotten what shit even looks like.
Welcome to the layer cake, son.
This thing ends here, tonight. You understand?
Drug money's easy money, not grief.
The odds, as you can see, are against you.
Goodnight.
If you're gonna hang around in this game, that's where you've got to be.
In your bonded warehouse with the ex-soldiers doing the dirty work, while you deliver the suspect lecture to baffle your opponents and cover your tracks.
The art of good business is being a good middleman.
Putting people together.
I'll always thank Eddie for telling me that.
It's all about honour and respect.
This is the end, Mr Duke, as I told you.
Do you know what?
I fucking enjoyed that, brother.
Just like the old days, Shanks.
A nice bit of armed robbery.
All right?
Where do you want the money sent, lah?
I'll let you know as soon as I do.
Again, I am sorry about Lucky.
Don't worry about it, kidder. Man was a prick, anyway.
Later.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Let's go.
Did I really think Eddie was gonna give me three million for those pills?
Did I fuck.
But suddenly there was a v oid where once there was Jimmy Price.
And after a couple of days, Eddie's little getting-in-and-getting-out speech started to mak e sense.
- Angelo.
Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- Can we get some privacy?
- Of course.
The king is dead.
Long live the king.
Well, I'm honoured.
But for me this is all over.
I'm getting out.
What was true then is true now.
Have a plan. Stick to it.
So I'm sure you must have lots to discuss, but I have no business being here.
I've got someone to meet.
Adiós, amigos.
Paul the boatman.
Kinky.
The Duk e.
Slasher.
Kilburn Jerry.
Crazy Larry.
Mr Lucky.
Troop.
Jimmy.
I don't want to add my name to that list.
My name?
If you knew that, you'd be as clever as me.
No!
I'm sorry. Subtitled by DeliXiosO
He was not faster or stronger or more clever than other children.
His family was not rich or powerful or well-connected.
In fact, they barely had enough to eat. Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy in the entire world.
He just didn't know it yet.
Soup's almost ready, darling.
Don't suppose there's anything extra to put in, love.
Oh, well. Nothing goes better with cabbage than cabbage.
Charlie I found something I think you'll like.
Charlie's father worked at the local toothpaste factory.
The hours were long, and the pay was terrible yet occasionally, there were unexpected surprises.
It's exactly what I need. What is it, Charlie?
Dad found it, just the piece I needed.
Well, how wonderful. It's quite a likeness.
- You think so?
- Think so?
I know so.
I saw Willy Wonka with my own two eyes.
- I used to work for him, you know.
- I did. - He did. He did.
I love grapes.
Of course, I was a much younger man in those days.
Willy Wonka began with a single store on Cherry Street.
But the whole world wanted his candy. - Mr. Wonka.
- Yeah?
We need more Wonka bars and we're out of chocolate birds.
- Birds?
Birds.
Well, then we'll need to make some more.
Here.
Now open.
The man was a genius.
Did you know he invented a new way of making chocolate ice cream so that it stays cold for hours without a freezer?
You can even leave it lying in the sun on a hot day, and it won't go runny.
- But that's impossible. - But Willy Wonka did it.
Before long he decided to build a proper chocolate factory.
The largest chocolate factory in history. Fifty times as big as any other.
He'd like to hear about that.
You mean, Prince Pondicherry?
Well, Prince Pondicherry wrote a letter to Mr. Wonka and asked him to come all the way out to India and build him a colossal palace entirely out of chocolate.
It will have 100 rooms, and everything will be made of either dark or light chocolate.
True to his word, the bricks were chocolate and the cement holding them together was chocolate.
All the walls and ceilings were made of chocolate as well.
So were the carpets and the pictures and the furniture.
It is perfect in every way. Yeah, but it won't last long.
You better start eating right now. Oh, nonsense.
I will not eat my palace.
I intend to live in it.
But Mr. Wonka was right, of course.
Soon after this, there came a very hot day with a boiling sun.
The prince sent an urgent telegram requesting a new palace but Willy Wonka was facing problems of his own.
All the other chocolate makers, you see, had grown jealous of Mr. Wonka.
They began sending in spies to steal his secret recipes.
Prodnose came out with a chewing gum that never lost its flavor.
Then Slugwon'th began making candy balloons that you could blow up to incredible sizes.
The thievery got so bad that one day, without warning Mr. Wonka told every single one of his workers to go home.
He announced that he was closing his chocolate factory forever.
I'm closing my chocolate factory forever.
I'm sorry.
Yes, well, sometimes when grownups say "forever," they mean "a very long time."
Such as, "I feel like I've eaten nothing but cabbage soup forever."
- Now, Pops. - The factory did close, Charlie.
And it seemed like it was going to be closed forever.
Then one day we saw smoke rising from the chimneys.
- The factory was back in business. - Did you get your job back?
No.
No one did.
But there must be people working there.
Have you ever seen a single person going into that factory or coming out of it?
No. The gates are always closed.
Exactly.
But then, who's running the machines?
- Nobody knows, Charlie.
- It certainly is a mystery.
Hasn't someone asked Mr. Wonka?
Nobody sees him anymore.
The only thing that comes out of that place is the candy already packed and addressed.
I'd give anything in the world just to go in one more time and see what's become of that amazing factory.
Well, you won't, because you can't.
It's a mystery, and it will always be a mystery.
That little factory of yours, Charlie, is as close as any of us is ever going to get.
Come on, Charlie.
- Good night, Grandpa George.
- Night-night. - Chair.
Thank you, dear.
Night, Grandpa Joe.
Good night, Grandma Georgina.
Nothing's impossible, Charlie.
Sleep well.
Indeed, that very night, the impossible had already been set in motion.
Dear people of the world I, Willy Wonka have decided to allow five children to visit my factory this year.
In addition, one of these children shall receive a special prize beyond anything you could ever imagine.
Five golden tickets have been hidden underneath the ordinary wrapping paper of five ordinary Wonka bars.
The bars may be anywhere in any shop, in any street, in any town, in any country in the world.
Wouldn't it be something, Charlie, to open a bar of candy and find a golden ticket inside?
I know, but I only get one bar a year, for my birthday.
Well, it's your birthday next week.
You have as much chance as anybody does.
Balderdash.
The kids who are going to find the golden tickets are the ones who can afford to buy candy bars every day.
Our Charlie gets only one a year.
He doesn't have a chance.
Everyone has a chance, Charlie.
Mark my words, the kid who finds the first ticket will be fat, fat, fat.
Augustus. This way.
I am eating the Wonka bar and I taste something that is not chocolate or coconut or walnut or peanut butter or nougat or butter brittle or caramel or sprinkles.
So I look and I find the golden ticket.
Augustus, how did you celebrate?
I eat more candy.
We knew Augustus would find the golden ticket.
He eats so many candy bars a day that it was not possible for him not to find one.
Yes, it is good, Augustus.
- Golden ticket claimed and four more...
Told you it'd be a porker.
What a repulsive boy.
Only four golden tickets left.
Now that they've found one, things will really get crazy.
- Of every shape, size and hue.
Can you spell that for us, please?
V-E-R-U-C-A.
Veruca Salt.
As soon as my little Veruca told me she had to have one of these golden tickets I started buying all the Wonka bars I could lay my hands on.
Thousands of them.
Hundreds of thousands.
I'm in the nut business, you see.
So I say to my workers:
Morning, ladies.
From now on, you can stop shelling peanuts and start shelling the wrappers off these chocolate bars instead.
Three days went by, and we had no luck. Oh, it was terrible.
My Veruca got more and more upset each day.
Where's my golden ticket?
I want my golden ticket.
Well, gentlemen, I just hated to see my little girl feeling unappy like that.
I vowed I would keep searching until I could give her what she wanted.
And finally, I found her a ticket.
Daddy, I want another pony.
She's even worse than the fat boy. I don't think that was really fair.
She didn't find the ticket herself.
Don't worry about it, Charlie.
That man spoils his daughter.
And no good ever comes from spoiling a child like that.
Charlie, Mum and I thought maybe you wanna open your birthday present tonight.
Here you are.
Maybe I should wait till morning. - Like hell.
- Pop.
All together, we're 381 years old.
Now, Charlie, you mustn't feel too disappointed you know, if you don't get the...
Whatever happens, you'll still have the candy.
Ah, well.
That's that.
- We'll share it. - Oh, no, Charlie.
Not your birthday present.
It's my candy bar, and I'll do what I want with it.
Thank you, darling.
Thank you, Charlie.
Bless you.
All right, let's see who found it.
"The third ticket was found by Miss Violet Beauregarde."
These are just some of the 263 trophies and medals my Violet has won.
I'm a gum chewer mostly, but when I heard about these ticket things I laid off the gum, switched to candy bars.
She's just a driven young woman.
I don't know where she gets it.
I'm the Junior World Champion Gum Chewer.
This piece of gum I'm chewing right now I've been working on for three months solid.
That's a record.
Of course, I did have my share of trophies, mostly baton.
So it says that one kid's gonna get this special prize, better than all the rest.
I don't care who those other four are. That kid, it's gonna be me.
Tell them why, Violet.
Because I'm a winner.
What a beastly girl.
Despicable.
You don't know what we're talking about.
Dragonflies?
But wait, this is just in.
The fourth golden ticket has been found by a boy called Mike Teavee.
All you had to do was track the manufacturing dates offset by weather and the derivative of the Nikkei Index.
A retard could figure it out.
Most of the time I don't know what he's talking about.
You know, kids these days, what with all the technology...
Die!
Die!
Die!
Doesn't seem like they stay kids very long.
In the end, I only had to buy one candy bar.
- And how did it taste?
- I don't know.
I hate chocolate.
Well, it's a good thing you're going to a chocolate factory, you ungrateful little...
That question is, who will be the winner of the last gold...?
- Dad?
- Yes, Charlie?
Why aren't you at work?
Oh, well, the toothpaste factory thought they'd give me a bit of time off.
Like summer vacation?
Sure.
Something like that.
In fact, it wasn't like a vacation at all.
The upswing in candy sales had led to a rise in cavities which led to a rise in toothpaste sales.
With the extra money, the factory had decided to modernize eliminating Mr. Bucket's job.
We were barely making ends meet as it was.
You'll find another job.
Until then, I'll just... Well, I'll just thin down the soup a little more.
Don't worry, Mr. Bucket, our luck will change.
I know it.
Charlie.
My secret hoard.
You and I are going to have one more fling at finding that last ticket.
You sure you want to spend your money on that?
Of course I'm sure.
Run down to the nearest store and buy the first Wonka candy bar you see.
Bring it straight back, and we'll open it together.
Such a good boy, really.
Grandpa?
- You fell asleep.
Which end should we open first?
Just do it quick, like a Band-Aid.
Did you see that some kid in Russia found the last golden ticket?
Yes, it was in the paper this morning.
Good boy.
Come on, George.
One Wonka Whipple-Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight, please.
The nerve of some people.
I know.
It's a golden ticket.
You found Wonka's last golden ticket.
In my shop too!
Listen. I'll buy it from you.
I'll give you $50 and a new bicycle.
Are you crazy?
I'd give him $500 for that ticket.
You wanna sell me your ticket for $500, young man?
That's enough of that.
Leave the kid alone. Listen.
Don't let anyone have it.
Take it straight home, you understand?
Mom! Dad!
I found it!
Here.
Read it aloud.
Let's hear exactly what it says. "Greetings to you, the lucky finder of this golden ticket, from Mr. Willy Wonka.
For now, I do invite you to come to my factory and be my guest for one whole day."
"I, Willy Wonka, will conduct you around the factory myself showing you everything there is to see."
"Afterwards, when it is time to leave you will be escorted home by a procession of large trucks each one filled with all the chocolate you could ever eat."
"And remember, one of you lucky five children will receive an extra prize beyond your wildest imagination.
Now, here are your instructions."
"On the 1 st of February, you must come to the factory gates at 10 a.m. Sharp.
You're allowed to bring one member of your family to look after you.
Until then, Willy Wonka."
The 1 st of February.
- But that's tomorrow.
- Then there's not a moment to lose.
Wash your face, comb your hair, scrub your hands, brush your teeth, blow your nose.
- And get that mud off your pants. - Now we must all try and keep very calm.
First thing that we have to decide is this:
Who is going with Charlie to the factory?
I will. I'll take him.
You leave it to me.
How about you, dear? Don't you think you ought to go?
Well, Grandpa Joe seems to know more about it than we do, and...
Provided, of course, he feels well enough.
A woman offered me $500 for the ticket.
I bet someone else would pay more.
There's plenty of money out there.
They print more every day.
But this ticket there's only five of them in the whole world and that's all there's ever going to be.
Only a dummy would give this up for something as common as money.
Are you a dummy?
No, sir.
Then get that mud off your pants.
Daddy, I want to go in.
It's 9:59, sweetheart. Make time go faster.
Do you think Mr. Wonka will recognize you?
Eyes on the prize, Violet.
Come forward.
Dear visitors it is my great pleasure to welcome you to my humble factory.
And who am I?
Well...
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka
The amazing chocolatier
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka
Everybody give a cheer!
Hooray!
He's modest, clever and so smart
He barely can restrain it
With so much generosity There is no way to contain it!
To contain it To contain, to contain, to contain!
Hooray!
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka
He's the one that you're about to meet
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka
He's the genius who just can't be beat
The magician and the chocolate wiz The best darn guy who ever lived
Willy Wonka, here he is!
Wasn't that just magnificent?
I was worried it was getting a little dodgy in the middle part, but then that finale...
Who are you?
"Dear guests, greetings.
I shake you warmly by the hand.
My name is Willy Wonka." Then shouldn't you be up there?
I couldn't very well watch the show from up there, now, could I, little girl?
Mr. Wonka, I don't know if you'll remember me but I used to work here in the factory.
Were you one of those despicable spies who tried to steal my life's work and sell it to parasitic, copycat, candy-making cads?
Welcome back. Let's get a move on, kids.
Don't you want to know our names?
- Mr. Wonka?
Sure is toasty in here. - What?
I have to keep it warm in here.
My workers are used to an extremely hot climate.
They just can't stand the cold.
All in good time.
Now...
Mr. Wonka, I'm Violet Beauregarde.
- I don't care. - Well, you should care.
Well, you do seem confident, and confidence is key.
I'm Veruca Salt.
It's very nice to meet you, sir.
I always thought a verruca was a type of wart you got on the bottom of your foot.
I am Augustus Gloop.
I love your chocolate. I can see that.
I never expected to have so much in common.
You're Mike Teavee.
You're the little devil who cracked the system.
And you. Well, you're just lucky to be here, aren't you?
- Parents. - Yeah.
Moms and dads.
- Would you like some chocolate? - Sure.
Then you should've brought some.
- Let's be friends. - Best friends.
An important room, this.
- After all, it is a chocolate factory. - Then why is the door so small?
That's to keep all the great big chocolatey flavor inside.
Now, do be careful, my dear children.
Don't lose your heads.
Don't get overexcited.
Just keep very calm.
It's beautiful.
What?
Oh, yeah, it's very beautiful.
Every drop of the river is hot, melted chocolate of the finest quality.
The waterfall is most important.
Mixes the chocolate.
Churns it up.
Makes it light and frothy.
By the way no other factory in the world mixes its chocolate by waterfall, my dear children.
And you can take that to the bank.
People.
Those pipes suck up the chocolate and carry it away all over the factory.
Thousands of gallons an hour. Yeah.
And do you like my meadow?
Try some of my grass.
Please have a blade.
Please do.
It's so delectable and so darn good-looking.
You can eat the grass?
Of course you can.
Everything in this room is eatable.
Even I'm eatable.
But that is called cannibalism, my dear children and is, in fact, frowned upon in most societies.
Yeah.
Enjoy.
Go on. Scoot, scoot.
Son.
Please.
Dad, he said, "Enjoy."
Why hold on to it?
Why not start a new piece?
Because then I wouldn't be a champion.
I'd be a loser, like you.
Daddy, look over there.
What is it?
It's a little person.
Over there, by the waterfall.
- There's two of them.
- There's more than two.
- Where do they come from?
- Who are they?
Are they real people?
Of course they're real people.
- Oompa-Loompas?
- Imported, direct from Loompaland.
- There's no such place.
- What? Mr. Wonka, I teach high-school geography, and I'm here to tell you...
Well, then you'll know all about it, and, oh, what a terrible country it is.
The whole place is nothing but thick jungles infested by the most dangerous beasts in the entire world.
Hornswogglers and snozzwangers and those terrible, wicked whangdoodles.
I went to Loompaland looking for exotic new flavors for candy.
Instead I found the Oompa-Loompas.
They lived in tree houses to escape from the fierce creatures who lived below.
The Oompa-Loompas ate nothing but green caterpillars, which tasted revolting.
The Oompa-Loompas looked for other things to mash up with the caterpillars to make them taste better:
Red beetles, the bark of the bong-bong tree.
All of them beastly but not quite so beastly as the caterpillars.
But the food they longed for the most was the cocoa bean.
An Oompa-Loompa was lucky if he found three or four cocoa beans a year.
But, oh, how they craved them. All they'd ever think about was cocoa beans.
The cocoa bean is the thing from which chocolate is made, so I told the chief:
They are such wonderful workers.
I feel I must warn you, though, they are rather mischievous.
Always making jokes. Augustus, my child, that is not a good thing you do!
Hey, little boy.
My chocolate must be untouched by human hands.
He'll drown.
He can't swim.
Save him!
Augustus!
Augustus!
Augustus, watch out!
There he goes.
Call the fire brigade!
It's a wonder how that pipe is big enough.
It isn't big enough.
He's gonna stick.
They're going to treat us to a little song. It is quite a special occasion.
They haven't had a fresh audience in many a moon.
Augustus Gloop, Augustus Gloop The great big, greedy nincompoop
Augustus Gloop, so big and vile So greedy, foul and infantile
"Come on!" we cried "The time is ripe To send him shooting up the pipe!"
But don't, dear children, be alarmed
Augustus Gloop will not be harmed
Augustus Gloop will not be harmed
Although, of course, we must admit He will be altered quite a bit
Slowly, wheels go round and round
And cogs begin to grind and pound
This greedy brute, this louse's ear
Is loved by people everywhere
For who could hate or bear a grudge
Against a luscious bit of fudge?
Bravo!
Where does that pipe go to?
That pipe, it just so happens to lead directly to the room where I make delicious strawberry-flavored, chocolate-coated fudge.
Then he will be made into strawberry-flavored, chocolate-coated fudge.
They'll be selling him by the pound all over the world?
The taste would be terrible.
Can you imagine Augustus-flavored, chocolate-coated Gloop?
No one would buy it.
I want you to take Mrs. Gloop up to the Fudge Room, okay?
Help her find her son.
Take a long stick and start poking around in the big chocolate-mixing barrel, okay?
Mr. Wonka?
Chewing gum is really gross Chewing gum, I hate the most See?
Exactly the same.
No, it isn't.
You really shouldn't mumble.
Because I can't understand a word you're saying.
Now, on with the tour.
- Are the Oompa-Loompas really joking?
- Of course they're joking.
That boy will be fine.
Gives one the feeling of being in love. You don't say.
All aboard.
Onward!
Mixes the chocolate, churns it up, makes it light and frothy.
- By the way, no other factory in the world...
- You're all quite short, aren't you?
- Well, yeah. We're children. Well, that's no excuse.
I was never as short as you. - You were once.
- Was not.
Know why?
Look at your short, little arms. You could never reach.
Do you even remember what it was like being a kid?
Oh, boy, do I.
Do I?
In fact, Willy Wonka hadn't thought about his childhood for years.
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
Who do we have here?
Ruthie, Veronica, Terrance.
Little Willy Wonka.
Willy Wonka was the son of the city's most famous dentist Wilbur Wonka.
Now let's see what the damage is this year, shall we?
Caramels.
Ought to be called "cavities on a stick."
Then we have all this...
You know, just last week, I was reading in a very important medical journal that some children are allergic to chocolate.
Makes their noses itch.
Maybe I'm not allergic.
I could try a piece. Really?
But why take a chance?
- How can they see where they're going?
- They can't.
There's no knowing where they're going.
Switch on the lights!
That doesn't make sense.
For your information, little girl whipped cream isn't whipped cream at all unless it's been whipped with whips.
Hey, Mr. Wonka, what's this?
They're for children who are given very little allowance.
You can suck on it all year, and it'll never get any smaller.
- Isn't that neat?
No. Gum is for chewing.
If you tried chewing one of these Gobstoppers you'd break all your little teeth off.
But they sure do taste terrific.
And this is Hair Toffee.
You suck down one of these little boogers and in exactly half an hour a brand-new crop of hair will grow out over the top of your little noggin.
- Who wants a beard?
- Well beatniks, for one. Folk singers and motorbike riders.
You know, all those hip, jazzy, super-cool, neat, keen and groovy cats.
It's in the fridge, daddy-o. Are you hep to the jive?
Can you dig what I'm laying down? I knew you could.
Slide me some skin, soul brother.
Unfortunately, the mixture isn't right yet.
Because an Oompa-Loompa tried some yesterday, and, well, he...
You look great.
Watch this.
Because this gum is a full three-course dinner all by itself.
Why would anyone want that?
"It will be the end of all kitchens and all cooking.
Just a little strip of Wonka's magic chewing gum and that is all you will ever need at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
This piece of gum happens to be tomato soup, roast beef and blueberry pie." It sounds great.
- It sounds weird. - It sounds like my kind of gum.
I'd rather you didn't. There are still some things that are... I'm the world-record holder in chewing gum.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- How is it, honey?
- It's amazing!
Tomato soup. I can feel it running down my throat.
Yeah. Spit it out.
Roast beef, with baked potato. Crispy skin and butter.
Keep chewing.
My little girl's gonna be the first person to have a chewing-gum meal.
I'm just a little concerned about the...
Blueberry pie and ice cream! - That part.
- What's happening to her nose?
It's turning blue.
Your whole nose has gone purple.
What do you mean?
- What's happening?
Because it goes a little funny when it gets to the dessert.
It's the blueberry pie that does it. I'm terribly sorry.
Mother?
What's happening to me?
Yeah, yeah
To the tale of Violet Beauregarde
This gentle girl She sees no wrong
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Yeah
She goes on chewing till, at last
Her chewing muscles grow so vast
Chewing, chewing all day long Chewing, chewing all day long
For years and years she chews away
Her jaws get stronger every day
And with one great, tremendous chew They bite the poor girl's tongue in two
To save Miss Violet Beauregarde Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Mr. Wonka!
I want you to roll Miss Beauregarde into the boat and take her along to the Juicing Room at once, okay?
Juicing Room?
Like a little pimple.
We gotta squeeze all that juice out of her immediately.
Mother, help me.
Please.
Come on.
Without the boat, we'll have to move double-time to keep on schedule.
There's far too much to see.
So they could see the factory, of course. But why now?
And why only five?
What's the special prize, and who gets it?
The best kind of prize is a surprise.
Will Violet always be a blueberry?
Maybe. I don't know.
That's what you get from chewing gum all day.
It's disgusting.
If you hate gum so much, why do you make it?
Once again, you shouldn't mumble.
It's starting to bum me out.
Can you remember the first candy you ever ate?
No.
In fact, Willy Wonka did remember the first candy he ever ate.
This is a room I know all about.
For you see, Mr. Wonka, I, myself, am in the nut business.
Are you using the Havermax 4000 to do your sorting?
Look.
I think that one's got a bad nut.
Daddy, I want a squirrel.
Get me one of those squirrels. I want one.
Veruca, dear, you have many marvelous pets.
All I've got at home is one pony and two dogs and four cats and six bunny rabbits and two parakeets and three canaries and a green parrot and a turtle and a silly old hamster.
I want a squirrel! All right, pet.
Daddy will get you a squirrel as soon as he possibly can.
But I don't want any old squirrel, I want a trained squirrel.
Very well.
Mr. Wonka, how much do you want for one of these squirrels?
Name your price.
Oh, they're not for sale. She can't have one.
Daddy.
I'm sorry, darling.
Mr. Wonka's being unreasonable.
If you won't get me a squirrel, I'll get one myself.
Veruca. Little girl?
Veruca.
No!
Let's find the key. Nope.
- Veruca! No.
It's not that one.
What are they doing?
Veruca!
Daddy!
To the incinerator.
But don't worry. We only light it on Tuesdays.
Today is Tuesday.
Well, there's always the chance they decided not to light it today.
Now, she may be stuck in the chute just below the top.
If that's the case, all you have to do is just reach in and pull her out.
And she will meet, as she descends A rather different set of friends
A rather different set of friends
A rather different set of friends
A fish head, for example, cut This morning from a halibut An oyster from an oyster stew
A steak that no one else would chew
And lots of other things as well
Each with its rather horrid smell
Horrid smell
These are Veruca's newfound friends That she will meet as she descends
These are Veruca's newfound friends
Who turned her into such a brat? Who are the culprits? Who did that?
The guilty ones, now this is sad
Are dear old Mum and loving Dad
Oh, really?
Well, that's good news.
Yeah.
Well, let's keep on trucking.
I don't know why I didn't think of this.
The elevator's by far the most efficient way to get around the factory.
How do you know, Mr. Smarty-Pants?
This isn't just an ordinary up-and-down elevator, by the way.
This elevator can go sideways, longways, slantways and any other ways you can think of.
You just press any button and, whoosh, you're off.
It's relatively new.
The administration offices.
Candy is a waste of time.
No son of mine is going to be a chocolatier.
Then I'll run away.
To Switzerland. Bavaria.
The candy capitals of the world. Go ahead.
But I won't be here when you come back.
And we certainly don't want that, now, do we?
This is the testing room for my very latest and greatest invention:
Television Chocolate.
"Hey, if television can break up a photograph into millions and millions of tiny pieces and send it whizzing through the air then reassemble it on the other end why can't I do the same with chocolate?
Why can't I send a real bar of chocolate through the television, ready to be eaten?"
I'm not gonna touch it.
I'm not going in that direction. Sounds impossible.
It is impossible.
You don't understand anything about science.
First off, there's a difference between waves and particles.
Second, the amount of power it would take to convert energy in matter would be like nine atomic bombs.
Mumbler!
Seriously, I cannot understand a single word you're saying.
Okey-dokey.
I shall now send a bar of chocolate from one end of the room to the other by television. Bring in the chocolate.
Same basic principle.
That bar of chocolate is now rushing through the air above our heads in a million tiny little pieces.
Come over here. Come on.
Come on. Come on!
Watch the screen.
Oh, look.
- Take it.
- It's just a picture on a screen.
Go on.
Just reach out and grab it.
It'll be delicious. It's the same bar.
It's just gotten a little smaller on the journey, that's all.
So imagine, you're sitting at home watching television and suddenly a commercial will flash onto the screen, and a voice will say:
"Wonka's chocolates are the best in the world.
If you don't believe us, try one for yourself."
And you simply reach out and take it.
How about that?
So can you send other things? Say, like, breakfast cereal?
Do you have any idea what breakfast cereal's made of?
It's those little curly wooden shavings you find in pencil sharpeners.
But could you send it by TV if you wanted to? - Of course I could.
- What about people? Well, why would I wanna send a person?
They don't taste very good at all.
Don't you realize what you've invented?
It's a teleporter.
It's the most important invention in the history of the world.
And all you think about is chocolate.
Calm down, Mike.
I think Mr. Wonka knows what he's talking about.
No, he doesn't. He has no idea.
You think he's a genius, but he's an idiot.
But I'm not.
Hey, little boy.
I sure hope no part of him gets left behind.
What do you mean?
Well, sometimes only half of the little pieces find their way through.
If you had to choose only one half of your son, which one would it be?
No need to snap. Just a question.
Try every channel.
I'm starting to feel a little anxious.
- There he is.
The most important thing we've learned As far as children are concerned
Is never, never let them near The television set
Or better still just don't install The idiotic thing at all
Never, never let them Never, never let them
It keeps imagination dead It clogs and clutters up the mind It makes a child so dull and blind
So dull, so dull
He can no longer understand A fairy tale, a fairyland
A fairyland, a fairyland
His brain becomes as soft as cheese
His thinking powers rust and freeze
He cannot think, he only sees
Regarding little Mike Teavee
Regret that we
Shall simply have to wait and see
Wait and see, wait and see
We very much regret that we
Shall simply have to wait and see
If we can get him back his height
But if we can't
It serves him right
Somebody grab him.
Help me.
Help me.
Oh, thank heavens.
He's completely unarmed.
Unarmed?
What are you talking about?
Just put me back in the other way.
It's television, not telephone. There's quite a difference.
And what exactly do you propose to do about it?
I don't know.
But young men are extremely springy.
They stretch like mad.
- Let's go put him in the taffy puller. - Taffy puller?
Hey, that was my idea.
Boy, is he gonna be skinny.
Yeah.
Taffy puller.
I want you to take Mr. Teavee and his little boy up to the taffy puller, okay?
On with the tour.
Mr. Wonka, Charlie's the only one left now.
You mean, you're the only one? Yes.
What happened to the others?
Oh, my dear boy, but that means you've won.
I'm absolutely delighted. I had a hunch right from the beginning.
Well done.
Now, we mustn't dilly or dally.
We have an enormous number of things to do before the day's out.
But luckily for us, we have the great glass elevator to speed things along...
Come on.
We're gonna need to go much faster, otherwise we'll just never break through. Break through what?
I've been longing to press that button for years.
Well, here we go.
Up and out. - But do you really mean...?
- Yeah. I do.
But it's made of glass.
It'll smash into a million pieces.
But I taste so good.
Yes, but you're blue.
Veruca, the only thing you're getting today is a bath, and that's final.
But I want it.
That little house.
Hi, Mom. Mom.
Dad.
- Charlie.
Goodness.
This is Willy Wonka.
I see that.
You must be the boy's...
- Parents?
- Yeah. That.
He says Charlie's won something.
Not just some something.
The most "something" something of any something that's ever been.
I'm gonna give this little boy my entire factory.
You must be joking.
Because you see, a few months ago, I was having my semiannual haircut and I had the strangest revelation.
In that one silver hair I saw reflected my life's work my factory, my beloved Oompa-Loompas.
Who would watch over them after I was gone?
I realized in that moment: I must find a heir.
And I did, Charlie.
You.
That's why you sent out the golden tickets.
What are Oompa-Loompas?
I invited five children to the factory and the one who was the least rotten would be the winner.
That's you, Charlie. So, what do you say?
Are you ready to leave all this behind and come live with me at the factory?
Sure. Of course. I mean, it's all right if my family come too?
Oh, my dear boy, of course they can't.
You can't run a chocolate factory with a family hanging over you like an old, dead goose.
No offense. None taken, jerk.
A chocolatier has to run free and solo.
He has to follow his dreams. Gosh darn the consequences.
Look at me.
I had no family, and I'm a giant success.
So if I go with you to the factory, I won't ever see my family again?
Yeah. Consider that a bonus.
Then I'm not going.
I wouldn't give up my family for anything.
Not for all the chocolate in the world.
Oh, I see.
That's weird.
I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka.
Well, that's just unexpected and weird.
Goodbye, then.
I'm sure.
Things are going to get much better.
And for once, Grandma Georgina knew exactly what she was talking about.
The next morning, Charlie helped his parents fix the hole in the roof.
Grandpa Joe spent the whole day out of bed. He didn't feel tired at all.
Charlie's father got a better job at the toothpaste factory repairing the machine that had replaced him.
Things had never been better for the Bucket family.
The same could not be said for Willy Wonka. I can't put my finger on it.
Candy's the only thing I was ever certain of and now I'm just not certain at all.
I don't know which flavors to make or which ideas to try.
I'm second-guessing myself, which is nuts.
I've always made whatever candy I felt like, and I...
I make the candy I feel like, but now I feel terrible, so the candy's terrible.
You're very good.
Walter. - Willy Wonka.
- That's the one.
Says here in the paper his new candies aren't selling very well.
But I suppose maybe he's just a rotten egg who deserves it.
- Yep.
- Oh, really?
You ever met him?
I did.
I thought he was great at first, but then he didn't turn out so nice.
He also has a funny haircut. I do not!
- Why are you here?
- I don't feel so hot.
What makes you feel better when you feel terrible?
My family.
What do you have against my family? It's not just your family.
It's the whole idea of...
They tell you what to do, what not to do and it's not conducive to a creative atmosphere.
Usually they're just trying to protect you because they love you.
If you don't believe me, you should ask. Ask who?
My father?
No way.
At least, not by myself.
Hey, what a good idea.
I've got transport...
I have to be more careful where I park this thing.
I think we've got the wrong house.
Do you have an appointment? No.
But he's overdue.
Open.
Now, let's see what the damage is, shall we?
Heavens.
I haven't seen bicuspids like these since...
Since...
Willy?
Hi, Dad.
All these years and you haven't flossed.
Not once.
It was on this day that Willy Wonka repeated his offer to Charlie who accepted on one condition.
Sorry we're late.
We were brainstorming.
Thought I heard thunder.
- You staying for dinner, Willy?
- Yes, please.
I'll shuffle the plates.
You smell like peanuts.
- I love peanuts.
- Oh, thank you.
You smell like old people and soap.
I like it.
Elbows off the table, Charlie.
How do you feel about little raspberry kites?
With licorice instead of string.
- Boys, no business at the dinner table.
- Sorry, Mom.
I think you're on to something, though, Charlie.
In the end, Charlie Bucket won a chocolate factory.
But Willy Wonka got something even better:
A family.
And one thing was absolutely certain:
Life had never been sweeter.
Spain, 1944
The Civil War is over.
Hidden in the mountains, armed men are still f·ghting the new Fascist regime.
Military posts are established to exterminate the Resistance.
A long time ago, in the Underground Realm, where there are no lies or pain,
there lived a princess who dreamt of the human world.
She dreamt of blue skies, soft breeze and sunshine.
One day, eluding her keepers, the princess escaped.
Once outside... the bright sun blinded her and erased her memory.
She forgot who she was and where she came from.
Her body suffered cold, sickness and pain.
And eventually she died.
However, her father, the king, always knew that the Princess' soul would return, perhaps in another body, in another place, at another time.
He would wait for her, until he drew his last breath, until the world stopped turning.
Why did you bring so many books, Ofelia?
We're going to the country, the outdoors.
Fairy tales?
You're a bit too old to be filling your head with such nonsense.
Ask him to stop the car.
Ofelia, wait.
Your brother's not well.
Madam, are you okay?
Ofelia?
Ofelia, Come here.
-l saw a fairy.
-Just look at your shoes!
Let's go.
When we get to the mill, come out to greet the Captain.
I want you to call him Father.
You have no idea how good he's been to us.
It's just a word, Ofelia...
just a word...
They're coming, Captain.
15 minutes late.
Carmen.
Welcome.
That's not necessary.
I can walk perfectly well.
Doctor Ferreiro prefers that you don't exert yourself.
No.
Come.
Do it for me.
Thank you.
Ofelia, come out.
Say hello to the Captain.
Ofelia.
It's the other hand, Ofelia.
Mercedes!
-Bring the luggage.
-Sir.
It's a labyrinth.
Just a pile of old rocks that have always been here.
Even before the mill.
Better not to go in there.
You may get lost.
Thank you.
Have you read them all?
Mercedes!
The Captain is calling. Your father needs me.
He's not my father.
The Captain is not my father.
My father was a tailor.
He died in the war.
He's not my father.
You've made that clear enough.
Shall we go?
Have you seen my mother?
-lsn't she beautiful!
She's sick with baby. Did you notice?
The guerrillas are sticking to the woods because it's hard to track them up there.
Those bastards know the terrain better than any of us.
We'll block all access to the woods
Food, medicine- we'll store it all.
Right here.
We need to force them down, make them come to us.
We'll set up three new command posts.
Here, here and here.
Mercedes.
-Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down.
This will help you sleep through the night.
Just two drops just before bed.
Two drops only. Very good.
All of it. Good.
Don't hesitate to call me if you need anything. Day or night.
You or your nurse.
Good night.
Close the door and turn off the lights, sweetie.
You have to help us.
Come up and see him.
The wound is getting worse.
His leg isn't any better.
This is all I could get.
I'm sorry.
Captain Vidal is waiting for you in his office.
Come here, Ofelia.
Jesus, your feet.
They're frozen!
Are you afraid? A little.
What's that noise?
Nothing, just the wind.
Nights here are different from city nights.
There, you hear cars-tramway.
Here the houses are old.
They creak. As if they were speaking.
Tomorrow, I'm going to give you a surprise.
-A surprise?
-Yes.
-A book?
-No, something much better.
Why did you have to get married?
I was alone too long.
I'm with you.
You weren't alone.
You were never alone.
When you're older, you'll understand.
It hasn't been easy for me either.
Your brother's at it again-
Tell him one of your stories.
I'm sure that'll calm down.
My brother, my brother...
Many, many years ago, in a sad, faraway land, there was an enormous mountain made of rough, black stone.
At sunset, on top of that mountain, a magic rose blossomed every night that made whoever plucked it immortal.
But no one dared go near it because its thorns were full of poison.
Men talked amongst themselves about their fear of death, and pain, but never about the promise of eternal life.
And every day, the rose wilted unable to bequeath its gift to anyone.
forgotten and lost at the top of that cold, dark mountain, forever alone, until the end of time.
Come in. -How is she?
-Very weak.
She'll have as much rest as as she needs.
I'll sleep down here.
-And my son?
-Pardon?
Excuse us, Captain.
My son, how is he?
For the moment, there's no reason to be alarmed. Very good.
Captain, your wife should not have traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy.
-ls that your opinion?
-My professional opinion, yes, sir.
A son should be born wherever his father is.
That's all. One more thing, Captain.
What makes you so sure the baby is a male? Don't fuck with me.
At 8 o'clock we detected movement in the northwestern sector.
Gunfire.
Sergeant Bayona searched the area and captured a suspect.
The other one's his son, here from the town.
Captain, my father is an honest man.
Let me judge that.
Take your hat off in front of me.
We found this weapon on him.
It's been fired.
My father was hunting rabbits, Captain.
Again, keep quiet.
"No God, no country, no Master"?
-Just like that-how do you like that?
-Red prpaganda, Captain.
It's not propaganda, sir.
It's an old almanac, Captain.
We're just farmers.
Go on.
I went up into the woods, Captain.
To hunt for rabbits.
For my daughters. They're sick.
Rabbits, uh?
Captain, if my father says so, he was hunting rabbits.
Leave him alone.
You killed him, You killed him!
Murderer!
Son of a bitch!
Maybe you'll learn to search these assholes properly before you come bothering me.
Yes, Captain.
Mother.
Mother, wake up!
Mother, there's something in the room.
Hello.
Did you follow me here?
Are you a fairy? Look!
This is a fairy.
You want me to go with you?
Outside?
Where?
Hello?
Hello?
Echo.
Echo.
Hello?
Hello? It's you.
It's you.
You've returned.
Don't be frightened, I beg you.
Look, look.
My name is Ofelia.
Who are you?
Me?
I've had so many names...
Old names that only the wind and the trees can pronounce.
I am the mountain, the forest and the earth.
I am... I am a faun.
Your most humble servant, Your Highness.
-You're Princess Moanna, daughter of the king of the underworld.
My father was a tailor.
You are not born of man.
It was the moon that bore you.
Look on your left shoulder and you will find a mark that proves it.
your real father had us open portals all over the world to allow your return.
This is...
This is the last of them.
But we have to make sure that your essence is intact, that you have not become a mortal.
You must complete three tasks before the moon is full.
This is The Book of Crossroads.
Open it, when you are alone and it will show you your future, show you what must be done.
But there's nothing in here.
Mercedes, prepare these rabbits for dinner tonight.
They are too young.
-Well, maybe they'll do for a stew. -Yes, sir.
This coffee was burnt.
Taste it yourself.
You should keep an eye on it.
As you wish, sir.
Cook these.
-He didn't like the coffee.
-He's nothing but a fussy dandy.
A fussy dandy!
We're going to need some beef and one more chicken.
-Where are we supposed to find that?
-The doctor's wife, the mayor's too.
Well, they eat more than a couple of pigs.
-And they don't shut up.
-Not even underwater.
I'll be back in a moment, Mercedes.
Ofelia.
Your father is giving a dinner party tonight.
Look what I've made for you.
Do you like it?
What I wouldn't have given to have such a dress... as fine as this when I was your age!
And look at the shoes!
-Do you like them?
-Yes, very pretty.
Go on, now. Take your bath.
Ofelia?
Ofelia?
Hurry up.
I want to see the dress on you.
I want you to be beautiful for the Captain.
You'll look like a princess.
A princess?
Make sure those chickens are cleaned properly.
And don't forget the beans.
-You look marvelous, my girl, just beautiful.
-What a gorgeous dress!
Get back to work, stop wasting time.
Do you want some milk with honey?
Move back, we can't have you getting milk on your dress, with you looking so pretty.
Mercedes.
Do you believe in fairies?
No.
But when I was a little girl, I did.
I believed in a lot of things I don't believe any more.
Last night, a fairy visited me.
Really?
And it wasn't alone, there were lots of them,
-And a faun, too.
-A faun?
He was very old, very tall and smelled like earth.
My mother warned me to be wary of fauns.
Mercedes!
Come with me.
Captain, everything is here.
Flour, salt, oil, medicine, olives, bacon.
This-this is real tobacco.
And the ration cards.
-l need you to check the inventory. -Very well.
Mercedes.
-The key. -Yes, sir.
-ls this the only copy?
-The only one. From now on, I'll carry it.
Captain.
Captain, perhaps it's nothing.
It's them.
"Once upon a time, when the forest was young, they were home to creatures who were full of magic and wonder."
"They protected one another, and slept in the shade of a colossal fig tree that grew on a hill, near the mill."
"But now, the tree is dying.
Its branches are dry, its trunk old and twisted.
A monstrous toad has settled in its roots and won't let the tree thrive.
You must put the three magic stones in the toad's mouth and retrieve the golden key from inside his belly.
Only then will the fig tree flourish again."
They were here less than twenty minutes ago.
They left in a hurry.
A dozen men, at most.
Antibiotics.
Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket.
They're here.
Those sons of bitches are here.
and they're watching us.
Hey!
You left this behind!
And your lottery ticket!
Why don't you come back and get it?
Who knows?
This could be your lucky day!
Hello.
I'm Princess Moanna, and I'm not afraid of you.
Aren't you ashamed living down here, eating all these bugs... and growing fat while the tree dies?
Have you looked in her room?
And the pantry? Yes, ma'am. Have you checked the garden?
-And the barn?
-Yes, ma'am.
Where is that girl?
This way, please.
Let me to introduce you to my wife, Carmen.
-Charmed.
-A pleasure to meet you.
From now on, one ration card per family.
Take a look.
-One?
-Only one.
Captain, I'm not sure it'll be enough.
If people are careful, it should be plenty.
We can't allow anyone to send food to the guerillas in the mountains.
They're losing ground, and one of them is wounded.
Excuse me, Captain, how can you be so sure?
We almost got them.
We found this.
Antibiotics.
God has already saved their souls.
What happens to their bodies hardly matter to Him.
We'll help however we can, Captain.
We know you're not here by choice.
I choose to be here because I want my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.
Because these people hold the mistaken belief that we're all equal.
But there's a big difference:
the war is over and we won.
And if we need to kill every one of these vermin to settle it, then we'll kill them all, and that's that.
Put the coffee on.
I'm going for more wood.
We'll take care of it.
Ofelia?
So, how did you and the Captain meet?
Ofelia's father used to make the Captain's uniforms.
Oh, I see...
And after he died, I went to work at the shop.
A little more than a year ago, the Captain and I met again.
Curious, isn't it!
I mean, finding each other again?
Oh, yes, very, very curious.
Please, forgive my wife.
She hasn't been exposed to the world.
She thinks these silly stories are interesting to others.
We understand.
Excuse me, madam Ofelia is here.
Excuse me.
Have I told you that I was acquainted with your father, Captain?
No.
I had no idea. In Morocco.
I knew him only briefly, but he left a great impression.
An excellent soldier.
The men in his battalion said that when General Vidal died on the battlefield, he smashed his watch on a rock so that his son would know the exact hour and minute of his death.
So he would know how a brave man dies.
Nonsense.
He didn't own a watch.
What you've done hurts me.
After your bath, you'll go to bed without supper.
Are you listening?
Sometimes I think you'll never learn to behave.
You've disappointed me, Ofelia.
And your father, too.
You mean the Captain?
Him more than me.
I've got the key.
Take me to the Labyrinth.
Hello.
I got the key out.
That's me, and the girl is you.
And the baby?
So... you retrieved the key.
I'm glad.
She believed in you from the very beginning.
She's so glad you succeeded.
Keep the key.
You'll be needing it very soon.
And this too?
a piece of chalk.
Two tasks remain and the moon is almost full.
Be patient.
We'll soon stroll through the seven circular gardens of your palace.
How do I know that what you say is true?
Why would a poor little faun like me lie to you?
Proceed.
Have your cards ready for inspection.
Let's go.
Your name?
Your names, first and last.
Narciso Pena Soriano, at your service.
This is our daily bread in Franco's Spain, kept safe in this mill!
The Reds lie... because in a united Spain, there's not a single home without fire or bread.
Come on, show me what happens now?
Show me.
Ofelia, help me...
Captain! Captain!
Come quickly.
... because in a united Spain, there's not a single home without fire or bread.
This is our daily bread in Franco's Spain...
Your wife needs uninterrupted rest.
She'll have to be sedated most of the time.
The girl should sleep somewhere else.
I'll stay here until the birth.
Make her well.
I don't care what it costs or what you need.
Make her well.
Don't worry.
Your mother will get better soon, you'll see.
Having a baby is complicated.
Then I'll never have one.
You're helping the men in the woods, aren't you?
Have you told anyone?
No, I haven't.
I don't want anything bad to happen to you.
Nor I to you.
Do you know a lullaby?
Only one... but I don't remember the words.
I don't care.
I still want to hear it.
Don't be afraid.
It's only me.
-Are you ready?
-Yes.
Then let's go.
This is sheer madness.
When that man finds out about us, he'll kill us all.
-Have you thought about that?
-Are you so afraid of him, Doctor?
It's not fear... at least not for myself.
Pedro!
Pedro, My brother!
You didn't carry out the task.
No, my mother is sick.
That's no excuse for negligence.
Look...
this is a mandrake root.
A plant that dreamt of being human.
Put it under your mother's bed in a bowl of fresh milk.
Each morning, give it two drops of blood.
Now, we have no time to waste.
The full moon will be upon us.
Take my pets to guide you through.
You're going to a very dangerous place, so be careful.
The thing that slumbers there, it is not human.
You will see a sumptuous feast, but don't eat or drink anything.
Absolutely nothing.
Your life depends on it.
I've brought some Orujo, tobacco, cheese.
Mail for Trigo and Piloto.
Let's see how that leg's doing, Frenchie.
How do you think it's doing?
It's fucked up.
Let's see.
... N-North American,
British and Canadian troops disembarked on a small beach in the North of F-F.
-"France", idiot.
-F-f-f-rance.
More than 150,000 soldiers give us hope... under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower... ls it really bad, doctor?
Look, Frenchie.
There's no way to save it.
I'll try to make it in as few cuts as possible.
Wait a second, doctor, just a second.
"Use the chalk to trace a door anywhere in your room."
"Once the door's open, start the hourglass."
"Let the fairies guide you."
"Don't eat or drink anything, during your stay, and come back before the last grain of sand falls."
No... This other one.
No! No!
We'll soon have reinforcements from Jaca.
Fifty men or more.
Then we'll go head to head with Vidal.
And then what?
You kill him, they'll send another just like him.
And another...
You're screwed, no guns, no safe shelter...
You need food, medicine.
You must take care of Mercedes.
If you really love her, you'd cross the border with her.
-This is a lost cause.
-l'm staying here, doctor.
There's no choice.
You have to leave.
Here's the key, but you can't go down there now.
It's exactly what he expects.
Leave it to me. I'm a coward.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
A coward... for living next to that son of a bitch, doing his laundry, making his bed, feeding him.
What if the doctor's right and we can't win?
At least we'll make things harder for that bastard.
Captain Vidal... Her temperature's down.
I don't know how, but it is.
But she still has a fever?
Yes, but it's a good sign.
Her body is responding.
Listen to me.
If you have to choose, save the baby.
That boy will bear my name and my father's name.
Save him.
Brother...
Little brother... lf you can hear me,
things out here aren't too good.
But soon you'll have to come out.
You've made Mama very sick.
I want to ask you one favor for when you come out, just one:
don't hurt her.
You'll meet her, she's very pretty, even though sometimes she's sad for days at a time.
You'll see, when she smiles, you'll love her.
Listen, if you do what I say, I'll make you a promise, I'll take you to my kingdom, and I'll make you a prince.
I promise you, a prince.
I sounded the whistle, but they wouldn't move.
I tried to stop, but it was too late.
The fireman and I jumped outjust in time, but look at the mess they made.
What did they steal from the freight cars?
They didn't open a single one.
What the hell are you talking about?
This whole mess...
They didn't open any of the cars.
-They didn't take anything.
-Nothing?
Are you sure?
God only knows what they wanted, other than to waste our time.
They came out of nowhere, Captain.
They have grenades, they went up hill.
Captain, we've surrounded a small unit that fell behind.
They took cover up on the hill.
Go ahead, Serrano, don't be afraid, this is the only decent way to die.
Serrano!
Let me see.
Can you talk? Damn it!
These are useless! They can't talk.
Captain, this one's still alive.
Shot in the leg.
-What's happened?
-They caught one. They took one of them alive. And they're taking him to the storeroom.
Mercedes!
Pedro... Pedro...
Mercedes?
-l need to get into the storeroom.
-Not now.
Move away!
That's plenty, dear.
Should I take this up?
Here, half the dose.
I don't think I need it.
I feel better, much better.
I don't understand. But I'm glad.
Mother...
Damn, this cigarette is good!
Real tobacco hard to find.
G-G-Go to hell.
Damn, Garces.
We catch one and he turns out to be a stutterer.
We'll be here all night.
As long as he talks.
Garces is right.
You'd do better to tell us everything.
But to make sure it happens, I brought along a few tools.
Just things you pick up along the way.
At first, I won't be able to trust you, but after I use this, you'll own up to a few things.
When we get to these, we'll have developed...
how can I put this-?
A closer bond, much like brothers.
You'll see.
And when we get to this one, I'll believe anything you tell me.
I'll make you a deal.
If you can count to three without st-t-tuttering, you can go.
Don't look at him, look at me.
Above me, there's no one.
-Garces!
-Yes, Captain?
If I say this asshole can leave, would anybody contradict me?
No one, Captain.
He can leave.
There you have it.
Count to three.
-One.
-Good.
Two.
One more and you will be free.
Shame.
Your mother is much better, Your Highness.
Surely, you must be relieved.
Yes, thank you.
But things haven't turned out so well.
No?
-l had an accident.
-An accident?
Yes.
-You broke the rules!
-lt was only two grapes!
I thought no one would notice.
-We've made a mistake!
-A mistake?
You failed.
You can never return.
-lt was an accident!
-You cannot return.
The moon will be full in three days.
Your spirit shall forever remain among the humans.
You shall age like them, you shall die like them and all memory of you shall fade in time.
And we'll vanish along with it.
You will never see us again.
Good day, doctor.
Sorry to wake you so early, but I think we need your help.
My God, what have you done to him?
Not much.
But things are getting better.
I like having you handy, Doctor.
It has its advantages.
Serrano, stay here.
I talked.
Not much.
-B-b-but I talked.
-l'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Kill me.
Kill me now, please.
Son of a bitch.
It'll take away the pain.
It's almost over.
Watch Dr. Ferreiro,
-l'll be right there. -Yes, Captain.
You're not moving anymore.
Are you sick?
What are you doing down there?
-Call him!
-Who?
Who else, you imbecile? Ferreiro!
What the hell is this? No!
No, no!
Leave her.
Leave her alone, please!
Look at this!
Look what she was hiding under your bed!
What do you think of this?
Ofelia, what is this thing doing under the bed?
It's a magic root the faun gave me.
This is all because of thatjunk you let her read.
Look what you've done!
Please, leave us alone. I'll talk to her, darling.
Fine.
As you wish.
He told me you would get better.
And you did.
Ofelia, you have to listen to your father.
You have to stop all this.
No. I want to leave this place!
Please, take me away from here!
Let's just go, Please!
Things are not that simple.
You're getting older, soon you'll see that life isn't like your fairy tales.
The world is a cruel place.
And you'll learn that, even if it hurts.
-No!
No!
-Ofelia!
Magic does not exist.
Not for you, me or anyone else.
Mom!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Why did you do it?
It was the only thing I could do. No.
You could have obeyed me.
I could have, but I didn't.
It would have been better for you. You know it.
I don't understand.
Why didn't you obey me?
To obey-just like that-for the sake of obeying, without questioning... that's something only people like you can do, Captain.
Captain!
Garces!
Call the troop paramedic.
-Get up immediately! -Yes, Captain.
Your wife is dead.
Because the paths to the Lord are inscrutable.
Because the essence of His forgiveness lies in His word and in His mystery.
Because although God sends us the message, it is our task to decipher it.
Because when we open our arms the earth takes in only a hollow and senseless shell.
Far away now is the soul in its eternal glory.
Because it is in pain that we find the meaning of life.
And the state of grace that we lose when we are born.
Because God, in His infinite wisdom, puts the solution in our hands.
And because it is only in His physical absence, that the place He occupies in our souls is reaffirmed.
You knew Dr. Ferreiro pretty well, didn't you, Mercedes?
We all knew him, sir. Everyone around here.
The stutterer spoke of an informer.
Here... at the mill.
Can you imagine?
Right under my nose.
Mercedes, please.
What must you think of me?
You must think that I'm a monster.
It doesn't matter what someone like me thinks, sir.
I want you to the storehouse and bring me some more liquor, please.
Yes, sir. Goodnight, sir.
Mercedes, aren't you forgetting something?
Sir? The key.
I do have the only copy, don't I?
Yes, sir.
You know, there's an odd detail that's been bothering me.
Maybe it's not important, but... the day they broke into the storehouse, with all those grenades and explosives, the lock itself wasn't forced.
As I said, it's probably not important.
Be very careful. Good night, sir.
Ofelia, Ofelia!
Ofelia, I'm leaving tonight.
-Where to?
-l can't tell you. I can't tell you...
-Take me with you.
-No, no. I can't.
I can't, my child.
But I'll come back for you, I promise.
Take me with you.
I heard something.
It's nothing, don't worry.
Mercedes. Ofelia.
How long have you known about her?
How long have you been laughing at me?
Little bitch!
Watch her!
And if anyone tries to get in, kill her first.
Dry meat. Tobacco.
If you had asked for it, I would have given this to you, Mercedes.
I want the names of whoever wrote these letters.
And I want them in front of me, tomorrow.
Yes, Captain. You can go, Garces.
You're sure, Captain?
For God's sake, she's just a woman.
That's what you've always thought.
That's why I was able to get away with it.
-l was invisible to you.
-Damn.
You've found my weakness: Pride.
But it's your weak points we're interested in.
It's very simple: you will talk...
And I have to know that everything you say is the truth.
We have a few things here strictly for that purpose.
Nothing complicated. Things we learn on the job.
At first... I'm not some old man! Not a wounded prisoner!
Mother Fucker!
Don't you dare touch the girl?
Won't be the first pig I gutted.
Look!
He let her go. The fuck did you say?
Get her!
Come on!
Bring her to me!
Bring her to me, damn it!
Mount up!
It'll be better if you come with me without struggling.
The Captain said that if you behave...
Don't be a fool, sweetheart.
If anyone's going to kill you... I'd rather it be me.
I've decided to give you one last chance.
Do you promise to do what I say?
Will you do everything I tell you, without question?
This is your last chance.
Then listen to me.
Fetch your brother and bring him to the labyrinth, as quickly as you can, Your Highness.
My brother?
We need him.
-But...
-No more questions.
The door's locked.
In that case, create your own door.
Captain, with your permission. Come quickly.
-Now what?
-Serrano is back. He's wounded.
Wounded?
Where's Garces?
How many were there?
I don't know exactly, Captain.
Fifty men, at least.
The rest of the men didn't make it.
Our watch posts are not responding.
-How many men we have left?
-Twenty, maybe less, sir.
We're leaving. Together.
Don't be afraid.
Nothing is going to happen to you.
Put them on picket duty at the tree line.
If the rest of the squad gets back, have it report immediately to me.
Radio for reinforcements, now.
Yes, Captain.
Leave him!
Ofelia!
Quickly, Your Majesty, give him to me.
The full moon is high in the sky, we can open the portal.
Why is that in your hand?
The portal will only open if we offer the blood of an innocent.
Just a drop of blood.
A pinprick, that's all.
It's the final task.
Hurry.
You promised to obey me!
-Give me the boy! -No!
My brother stays with me.
You would give up your sacred rights for this brat you barely know?
Yes, I would.
You would give up your throne for him?
He who has caused you such misery, such humiliation?
Yes, I would.
As you wish, Your Highness.
No!
My son.
Tell my son...
Tell him what time his father died.
-Tell him that I... -No.
He won't even know your name.
Arise, my daughter.
Come.
Father.
You have spilled your own blood rather than that of an innocent.
That was the final task, and the most important.
And you chose well, Your Highness.
Come here with me, and sit by your father's side.
He's been waiting for you so long.
And it is said the princess returned to her father's kingdom.
That she reigned there with justice and a kind heart for many centuries.
That she was loved by her people.
And that she left behind small traces of her time on earth, visible only to those
(CHATTERING) Attention.
At ease, gentlemen.
Be seated, please.
As you've all probably noticed, we're currently headed north.
Tomorrow morning at 0500 hours, we will be taking a position at Yankee Station.
That means we're back in business.
We'll be flying sorties over North Vietnam to take out enemy supply lines, which means we have to cross over into Laos.
This mission is classified.
No cards and letters to sweethearts. No phone calls to family back home.
- Is that understood?
- TROOPS: Yes, sir.
No one can know.
No one except Charlie when we kick his ass.
For survival in the jungle environment, the smart soldier must understand that nature is not a force against him.
He has to make nature work for him by utilizing the ample natural provisions at his disposal.
SPOOK: Is this a double feature?
For God's sake, just lean your head back and open your mouth.
What is this?
Hell, the boys back home don't know anything about the jungle.
NARRATOR: In the jungle, your best friend is your knife.
SPOOK: Oh, look at...
Now he's getting serious.
Cut the leaf, man. Here it goes. Come on, baby, cut.
Where is the salt and pepper shaker for that leaf?
Chew it, boy!
Chew it!
Leaf good. Me like leaf.
NARRATOR: Maintain a constant state of readiness...
What did he do, sit in an anthill?
Look at him.
NARRATOR: And then, when the rescue helicopter appears, make sure...
SPOOK:
Honestly, it's right above your head!
Jeez. Shake it, Pops.
He's got a nice ass for a sailor, I'll tell you that.
I don't mean that in a weird way.
God bless America.
NARRATOR: Are you a smart soldier?
I mean, I just thought we'd be assisting some South Vietnamese generals against a few infiltrators.
Whole thing would be done in three, four weeks.
You picked the wrong time - to enlist, Dengler. - I know.
No, but I just wanted to fly so badly, and everybody, they were telling me all about the fantastic massage parlors and the go-go girls, everything, and...
And what did I get?
Goddamn one night?
- One night in Saigon. That's me.
- Yeah, and that didn't go so well.
Gentlemen, next please.
Okay.
Hey, are there any mosquito nets?
What you see is what you get.
- Okay. Okay. I see plastic.
- Yes, sir.
I see plastic there and how about...
Are you able to give me two slices of that plastic, please?
- Sir?
- And maybe six foot by three foot, you put a zipper in the middle,
- and I crawl inside...
- What you're describing is a sauna, not a mosquito net.
Not a mosquito net, but it holds off the bugs.
And you put some netting on it so I can breathe through at night time.
- Absolutely, sir.
- Okay.
Now, look here.
Look at this. I have my boot on your table.
- Why do I have my boot on your table?
- I don't know, sir.
Okay, this is why. Look at this.
Can you create a flap for me in the tongue here so I could hide my American passport inside of here should I need it?
You know what, sir?
Since you're my only customer today, it would be my pleasure.
Thank you.
So, Charlie got his shit together.
Now we have heavy antiaircraft fire around Mugia Pass.
Change direction and altitude every seven seconds so the radar of the enemy gun cannot lock onto you.
Your secondary target will be the intersection of 121 and 90.
That's the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
That's right, Spook, inside Laos.
Now, one more thing.
They've been using your radios to lure our rescue teams into ambush.
Now, don't get me wrong. You go down, you use that radio.
But if they're hot on your trail, you scrap it.
You scrap anything that they can use against you.
Now, this is Flight Lieutenant Dengler's first mission.
Yes, sir.
ADMIRAL: You're gonna be Spook's wingman. You think you can handle that?
I could not ask for a better man, sir. But, please,
- could I ask you a question, sir? - ADMIRAL:
Go ahead.
You know, Spook is such a goddamn daredevil, could you please order him not to try too hard to die for his country, but rather to let the son-of-a-bitch on the other side die for his instead?
Okay. All right, boys.
- You all set? - TROOPS:
Yes, sir.
Anything else?
- TROOPS:
No, sir. - Okay. Let's go, go, go!
PILOT: Radar Kilo, 6195, position four.
PILOT 2: Radar Yankee, 67279, position two.
- Heads against the wall. Come on.
- Come on, Diet.
Come here.
This is what we would do as kids when we were out for mischief.
It would keep us out of trouble.
But we would usually pee right now.
- Can we pee?
- I don't really have to.
I'm not gonna.
But this will keep us safe. Okay, fellas?
Stay out of trouble. Come back in one piece.
Good luck.
- Come back, boys.
- You, too.
SPOOK: Boys, get set to change the altitude again. On my mark.
- Now.
- Roger.
SPOOK: Gentlemen, do you notice the coastline down there?
Welcome to North Vietnam.
It's pretty boring.
SPOOK: Boys, we got too much cloud cover.
Climbing again 280 west. We're heading into Laos.
Target in sight.
Lessard, roll in.
LESSARD: Rolling.
SPOOK: Farkas, roll in.
FARKAS: Rolling.
SPOOK: Dengler, roll in.
Rolling in.
I'm hit.
I'm hit!
SPOOK: Dieter, you're losing altitude!
Pull it up!
Dieter, pull up!
Dengler, get out of there!
Dieter, bail out!
Dieter, bail out!
I'm not gonna bail out!
I'm not gonna bail out!
DIETER: Oh, come on.
Come on.
Come on, search planes.
Where are you?
Where have you gone?
Come on.
God, how can it get this hot?
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(SOFTLY) Hey. Hey. I need to go to the bathroom.
I need...
I need to go to the bathroom.
Yeah. I need to take a shit.
Hey. Hey.
I need to take a shit.
Oh, shit.
Hey. Hey.
Does nobody listen to me?
Why doesn't anybody listen around here?
Why don't you listen to me?
I said I needed the bathroom and now I've shit myself.
Why doesn't anybody listen around here?
I've shit my pants.
(HELICOPTER CHUGGING)
They can't hear us.
They can't see us through the treetops.
It's not my fault.
I didn't signal them.
(SHOUTING) Don't ever, ever do that again!
You better just shoot me right away!
Don't you ever do that again!
(INAUDIBLE)
(SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
This is unusual.
You American pilots normally attack us earlier in the day. Sit.
No English.
German.
Why don't you admit that you are an American?
Yes.
I am an American citizen, and I love my country.
But why are you in this war against us?
I never wanted to go to war. I never wanted to go to...
I saw enough as a child. I only wanted to fly.
Then you should sign this.
"Condemning the imperialistic aggression "of the corrupt and debased political establishment of the United States... "
What else would you call it?
"... against innocent children and the peace loving working classes. "
No, I cannot sign this. I cannot sign it.
If you sign this, we would be your friends.
- You could be released in two weeks if...
- I cannot sign this.
- It's against my...
- Your what?
I mean, what is in here?
What isn't here?
I love America. America gave me wings.
I will not sign it, absolutely not.
No way.
Your choice.
The quick have their sleepwalkers, and so do the dead.
Hey.
- Hey. Hey. - GENE:
Hey, there. Who's that?
Hello.
GENE: Hey, you American?
- What?
- GENE: He's American.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, I'm American.
My name is Dieter.
I'm a U.S. Navy pilot.
And originally I was born in Germany...
- DUANE:
Be quiet.
- ... but I am a U.S. citizen now.
- DUANE: Quiet.
- What?
- Who's that?
- DUANE: Quiet.
Why?
I'm whispering.
- Little Hitler's coming.
- Who?
- Little Hitler.
- Who's that?
Who's Little Hitler?
Okay.
Now, what the hell is this?
The Middle Ages?
DUANE: Hey, listen. Don't mess with these guys.
You'll regret it.
- Hi. Dieter Dengler.
- All right, let's go. Give it over.
Who won the World Series?
- The World Series?
- Yeah.
- I don't know...
- Hey, man, the guy don't like baseball?
You don't like baseball?
- No, I don't know.
I don't follow baseball.
- I'm Yik Chiu Tuo.
- Yik Chiu Tuo?
- They call me Y.C.
- Okay, Y.C.
- Y.C.
Hi, I'm Dieter Dengler.
- Dieter Dengler.
- Yeah.
We all flew together for Air America.
Yeah, I'm world champion of bad luck.
But I tell you something, I'm undefeatable.
Hi. Phisit.
- Phisit.
- My name is Phisit.
- Dieter. Dieter. - Yeah.
Procet Kam Phong Kit.
- What?
- Procet.
- Okay.
- Procet.
What was that?
- Procet.
- It's okay.
Okay.
- That was actually Procet... Got that?
- Right.
- But you need to call him Procet.
- Okay, Procet.
That's what we call him.
He's also Air America.
- Also got shot down flying supplies...
- Okay, okay.
...to royalist villages,
- just like the rest of us.
- And when was that?
Two... No, two and a half year ago now.
- Two and a half years ago?
- Oh, yeah.
I had no idea that we were here for that long.
Yeah, been here a lot longer than people know.
- Duane Martin.
- Duane Martin.
I'm Dieter Dengler.
United States Air Force. I was shot down about a year and a half ago.
- Okay.
- And when this war starts, we'll be here a lot longer than we already have.
Well, you see...
How many more times you think I'm gonna have to say, like I been saying and saying and saying and saying again, that we will never go to war in Vietnam, man?
- DIETER: No, they just...
- They, no...
Because any day now... Listen.
They will what?
- Yeah, Christmas come every day.
- They...
They will release us, man.
They will let us go any day now.
- No, you see...
- Gene, by the way.
- Gene.
- But listen.
It's...
The trick to it is it's actually Eugene.
- Okay, Eugene.
- Eugene DeBruin from
- Eugene, Oregon. - Okay.
- How do you like that?
- Yeah.
See how that works out?
Name, name...
Jesus Christ, not this Oregon shit, again.
I've heard this over 2,000 goddamn times.
- Eugene from Eugene.
- Oh, yeah, right.
Eugene from Eugene.
- You know what?
You know what?
Listen.
- Yeah.
What you really need to know is you see this man here?
Take a good look at him. He, he...
Listen now, he shits in his pants every night without fail, man.
Trust me.
And you know the only thing that he thinks is worth complaining about?
You know what that is?
- This man right here.
- Right.
- Eugene from Eugene.
- From Eugene.
Okay.
GENE: Dieter.
Take a careful look to your right. You see that guy there?
We call him Little Hitler for a very good reason.
He is the worst.
This one we call Jumbo.
DIETER: Oh, wow.
That's the first smile I've seen since I was shot down.
Yeah. He's, in fact, one of the only truly nice guys here.
This is Nook the Rook right here. He's also very much not a nice guy.
- What is his problem?
- It's all right. Just keep going.
His problem is he's Crazy Horse.
That's what we call him.
And he is a bastard. Keep going.
And I just cannot stand him.
- That's Walkie Talkie.
- Walkie Talkie?
We call him that 'cause he does not speak.
Never, never.
Hey, do yourself a favor, Kraut.
Keep your head down and your mouth shut.
That's your best chance of surviving.
So there is a war.
There is a war.
All right. So tell me about the peace talks, man. Geneva?
There's got to be peace talks, man.
Shut up, Gene. There is no goddamn conference.
When are you gonna get that through your skull?
Secret talks, man.
I'm just talking about secret talks.
Forget it.
We're not getting out.
No, no, no, there was a honcho on the outside, he said I would not be here too long.
They tell that to everyone to get them to sign.
No, I did not sign. No.
Anyway, nice having met you.
What do you mean, met?
Well, my friends, you can rot in here if you like, but I'm gonna scram this very night.
This hut, it ain't no prison.
Scram. I like that. I like that.
Listen, listen, my friend, you cannot escape.
If you try to escape, you'll screw up our release.
Look, I don't give a shit about our release or whatever you think is gonna happen.
But without water, you won't survive more than two days out there.
And without water, your tracks will be visible for even more.
The jungle is the prison.
Don't you get it?
Hey, when does the rainy season start?
Five months, maybe six.
I can't wait that long.
Hey, listen, let's say you do survive the jungle and lack of water, whatever you find, snakes and animals and shit are out there, you won't make it out of camp.
There's six guards posted during the day.
Yeah.
That is during the day.
I'm going at night.
Why, what happens at night?
No.
No.
No.
I'm shitting my intestines out.
Again.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.
You just shit right on my hand again, man.
- Sorry.
- That makes it 2,207 times and counting.
Leave the guy alone, okay?
There ain't no alone, brother.
Does anybody have a nail?
What are you gonna do with a nail?
You're gonna stab all the lousy guards to death with a nail?
What kind of plane you fly off of?
- Procet has got a shard of glass, man.
- No, that's no good.
I have porcupine needle.
No.
I've got a hammer and a socket wrench stuffed up my ass.
There's no nails.
This whole prison's made of bamboo and rattan.
Damn it.
I know where there's a nail.
Okay.
I'm gonna make my move.
So all of you scatter in all directions, okay? Go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What makes you think you're not crazy for thinking that'll work, man?
Eugene's right.
It'll attract too much attention.
Oh, for God's sake, that's what I want.
Please.
You trust me? Please.
Duane, head to the outhouse.
Y.C., go to the top right. Okay?
Gene, please come on. No, no, no.
Gene, Phisit, Procet, head towards the gate.
Move as fast as you can.
Get their attention, that's what I need. Go, go, go, go. Go, go.
Hey, Jumbo, Jumbo. Hey, no, no, no.
Can I borrow some of the toothpaste?
Let me get some of that. That's good.
I felt so like having a good smile, you know?
Like you have. You got a good smile, too.
Okay.
Y.C., when I hit it, you make a noise.
Cough or something.
(COUGHING)
I love it.
I love it.
I love it. I love it. I love it.
(WHISPERING) Give me some slack.
Let's see.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, that was an easy one.
You see, I apprenticed as a tool and die maker in Germany.
There was no aviation at the time and I wanted to learn something useful that would help me repair planes.
And, boy, are those years coming in handy in unexpected ways now.
There's only one brand that I cannot handle, that is Smith and Wesson.
I think with practice, I can open these up in maybe two, three seconds flat.
But listen, everybody keep one cuff on a wrist at all times, so that if the guards come checking, we can put them on again quickly.
No, they don't check us at night.
They think we can't get out of these.
They think it's impossible.
Show me how you did that.
It's so simple. Okay.
All you do, insert the nail.
There's a cuff and a spring. They both have teeth.
You push down on the spring, disengage the teeth like that.
You see?
This is what happens inside.
- And the cuffs release. - GENE:
Wow.
Hands free.
DIETER: Get away.
Get away.
No, no, no, no, no. Let him.
He's our friend, Malay.
Let him do it.
It's the best way to heal sores around here.
Okay.
Hey, that cuff thing, that's good, real good.
Yeah. Thanks.
Hey, Duane, do you know where we are?
No. But my guess is that this here's still Laos.
And the guards, they're...
- Laotian.
- Yeah, but the camp is Vietcong, there's no question.
Laotian?
- Yeah.
Look, I know what you're thinking, but jungles on these mountains is a nightmare.
Besides, you'd end up in Vietnam.
- No, but if we can get to Thailand...
- Yeah.
If we can make it to the Mekong River...
Yeah, the Big Muddy. If you could, you would, right?
Yeah. We can.
- Hey, why not?
We can.
- Yeah.
Just stop talking about it. Okay?
Just quiet. Excuse me.
- Hey, Gene.
- Yeah.
Which of you guys knows most about the country?
Oh, that would be Phisit, but he doesn't talk to us.
What do you mean?
You see, Phisit is pissed about...
About... (CHUCKLES)
We don't even remember what he's pissed about.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, come back!
Hey!
I can't believe that bastard shot you.
I know. I didn't even pull down my flight suit.
Hey, look, when I was standing it looked like...
We're gonna get even one day.
Howdy.
Americali.
- Americali.
- Americali. Americali. Americali.
Two years ago a parcel came through.
DUANE: Yeah.
He puts it on display on really bad days.
The bacon label still looks greasy.
Does it still have a scent on it?
Oh, you bet.
Can I get a sniff?
Oh, no, you may not.
You may not. That is my sniff.
Man, that is my sniff.
Hey.
How'd you ever end up a pilot?
I always...
I always wanted to be one.
I was five years old, or something, in a little town, Wildberg, in the Black Forest, and it was just bombed to ashes, you know?
No clear reason, just these senseless attacks.
But I remember I was in the attic with my brother.
We were looking out, and we see this fighter plane, beautiful, coming right at us.
And it's firing from its wings, and I see the machine gun, it's flashing and it
(IMITATES WHOOSHING) goes flying past the house.
It's so close. I mean, it's feet away from the house.
And the canopy was open.
And this pilot, he had his goggles up on his helmet.
And I could see his eyes.
And he was looking at me.
Right at me.
He's looking right at me.
And as he turns to go, he's starting back, he's looking right at me still.
And the thing is, from that moment on, little Dieter,
he needed to fly.
You're a strange bird, Dieter.
Guy tries to kill you and you want his job.
Yeah.
God, we need the rain.
We need the rain to come quicker.
See, here's what I can see, you still need to understand.
- No, I understand.
- You wanna talk about the rain again, we...
Listen, now. Listen.
We will be released by the time the rain comes like I have told you before...
- Stop telling me.
- I don't wanna have to keep telling you.
- Then stop telling me.
- They will release us.
You understand?
And here's what I'm starting to think, that maybe you're trying not to understand.
If you try and escape, we, we will be killed, we who you leave behind.
We who have been here for two years.
Two years before you showed up.
I don't want to escape alone. We escape together.
Wait, wait.
Why would the guards spend all this time cutting bamboo and wood to build a watchtower if we weren't meant to be here for a while?
- Exactly.
- Two years.
- Exactly. Why would they do that if they...
- Listen. Listen to me.
- ... didn't plan to hold us a long time?
- Listen. Here's what it all comes down to.
I am not, I'm not gonna let you do that.
No, no, no.
You know what I am gonna do?
I am gonna scream.
That's right. I think I'm gonna scream my head off.
'Cause see, I would much rather they shoot you, than me, or any of us. You understand?
DIETER: Yeah.
You understand?
Yeah.
You've been warned.
Haven't you?
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
This is for shaving.
Howdy.
- Man, I can't get over it.
- What, this?
No, that girl, you know?
She smiled at me.
And when she smiled, man, did I wish there was no war.
Really.
- I thought you were engaged.
- Oh, yeah, I am.
We got engaged the day before I left.
Marina, she is a wonderful girl. So smart, you know?
She studies marine biology.
But I hope that she's waiting for me.
- I'm sure she is.
- Yeah, well, she said she would, but, you know, women can be funny and go looking for another man... (GUN firing)
Duane, you okay?
- Yeah.
- Y.C.?
Yik Chiu Tuo, okay.
Okay. Gene?
Phisit?
Procet?
Yeah.
ALL WHISPERING: Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday, dear Dieter.
Happy birthday to you.
It is May the 22nd?
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday, Dieter.
What kind of champagne is this?
You just got to keep thinking protein, lots of protein.
It's not bad.
Squished insect larva.
Protein.
Oh, this is a good year, this one.
(WHISPERING) Yeah, my favorite.
So, listen, guys.
Thank you so much.
And it is my birthday, yes, but I would like to give you some presents.
Okay. Now, look.
I have taken these cartridge shells and I have made a knife of each one.
Okay.
Now, I'm sorry, but I have to keep one for myself. Okay?
Duane, you're first.
Right.
Phisit.
Left or right?
Y.C.
Easy money, pal.
Gene.
- Procet, it is yours. Okay.
- I don't care about the knife.
This is for Crazy Horse.
No, no, no. Crazy Horse is mine.
My Crazy Horse. Mine.
Now listen, we must collect the rice and hide it.
But we must dry it because it rots too quickly if we don't dry it, okay?
What? Hide it?
You wanna hide it?
- Yeah, yeah.
- We can eat it now.
- No, no.
- We eat it now.
Look, look, look, I've created a secret compartment here for the rice.
It is at the bottom of my crap container.
So I don't think the guards - are gonna want to check that.
- Crazy. This is...
Why are you hiding it now?
For our escape.
You have a plan.
DIETER: Yes.
Now, have you noticed that the guards when they are called to the kitchen hut for chow time, they always leave their rifles behind, always?
So we have a few minutes before they return for their rifles.
We go out through the hut, we grab their guns,
- we surprise them.
- No.
- And we surprise... We surprise them...
- Crazy.
...and we surround them, okay?
Then we take the guards as prisoners. We take over the camp. Think about it, okay?
We hold it down for a few days until we can signal our aircraft to pick us up.
(SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
- Dieter, quick.
- Okay.
They'll call mess any second.
Quick, quick.
- Who's in the kitchen?
- I see four.
The cook, Little Hitler and Nook the Rook and somebody I've never seen before.
He looks like a villager.
- DUANE: What about the rifles?
- Okay, rifles.
Little Hitler's rifle and Nook's rifle in Hut A.
And, okay, Crazy Horse going towards Hut B with his submachine gun.
There's somebody else coming up over the hillside.
- I can't make him out, but he has a machete.
Who?
Okay.
Oh, shit.
Nook the Rook is coming back with his food.
Quick. Quick.
Hooks in now. Hide the nail. Hide the nail.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Okay. Okay.
Close it.
Nice, because we all happen to be... (ALL SINGING) Hungry
- DIETER: Hey, Duane.
- What?
Okay. Your turn.
- What, my turn?
- DIETER: Yeah.
- Stack it up.
- Oh, all right. You ready?
- Bottom shelf, raspberry pie.
- Okay.
The way my mom makes it with the crust as thick as a steak.
- Yeah. - And on top shelf is a turkey.
I'm not talking Thanksgiving big. I'm talking, you know, an obscene, enormous, like, 35-pound turkey with breasts the size of Jayne Mansfield's.
You know what I mean?
You've got gravy, stuffing, six-pack of Budweiser...
No, no, no, no.
No, I prefer the Bavarian stein. You know?
With a quarter of a gallon and it's dark and it's cool and you get the foam lapping up
- It's so cool you get the mist on the side...
- All right, that's in your fridge.
- This is my fridge. Right?
- Okay.
- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
- Six-pack stays where it is.
Yeah. It's okay.
- Muffins.
- Okay.
- Yeah. - Okay, oranges, couple of dozen eggs.
- All right. - And, oh, a pile... A huge pile of pancakes
- with tons of syrup, I mean, just soaked.
- Why always the sweet stuff?
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Why always the sweet stuff?
- You stack the fridge. Go ahead.
- DIETER: Okay.
- It's my turn. - DIETER:
Noodles and Spam, okay.
No, okay. Sorry. Go ahead.
- It's your turn. You go.
- Right.
- Some cake. - Yeah.
See, you ruined it.
Why you always got to interrupt me?
(CHUCKLING)
DIETER: Okay, rifle one and rifle two in Hut A.
Submachine gun in Hut B and another rifle in Hut C.
- DUANE: That's new. Are you sure?
- DIETER: Affirmative.
And in the kitchen we have Nook the Rook,
Crazy Horse and Jumbo arriving.
Jumbo's gun?
- DUANE: Jumbo's gun? - DIETER:
Duane.
(COCKING GUN)
- DUANE:
What? - DIETER: Duane.
DUANE: It's just a game.
It's just a game.
I won.
Phisit.
Hold this side up.
Do you see it?
DUANE: No.
- I see it.
- Yeah, that's because you dug it.
You did a good job, trust me.
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
DIETER: (WHISPERING) I've seen clouds, okay?
When does the monsoon start?
I don't know.
Could be another two weeks.
- No, no, no, no. - Or a month.
No, no, no, no, no.
- Maybe five days. - Okay. No.
We need to set a start date because the guards, you know, they are starving as well.
And they are getting meaner and meaner, so...
I don't care about anything else. Your plan, I don't care.
- You can stay behind... - Listen to me.
- ... if you want. - Listen to me now.
- How about that?
Dieter, I'm on board.
I'd rather be dead out there than rotting away in here.
Okay, buddy. Okay.
Y.C., are you on board?
I guess so.
- Okay. Procet?
- I am out.
- You are out of the plan?
- I am.
No, no, I want to get out.
You're coming with us out.
Great. Okay, Phisit?
(CHUCKLES)
That's a yes. So...
So, it is settled then.
Okay.
July the 4th.
July the 4th.
No matter what.
We had this two years ago when it was really bad.
- DIETER: How can it get any worse?
- Really bad.
You don't ask, you just eat.
You just smile, smile and eat. Duane, Duane, Duane.
- Come on.
- No.
You got to try. It's protein.
Protein's not gonna kill you.
Just try.
Hey.
I am going to eat my rice.
- I'm gonna eat my rice. - DIETER:
No, you are not.
GENE: I'm gonna eat that rice.
I'm gonna eat that rice because it is my rice.
- You are not.
- GENE: I will eat my rice.
We're not gonna eat that rice.
GENE: My rice.
That is not your rice. That is our rice.
- Okay. - GENE: Oh, I see.
And I tell you what.
I'm not gonna let you out of your handcuffs tonight, okay?
Because I still have the key.
Oh, I see. I see.
Let me see if I have this right.
You're the warden himself now.
Is that right? Is that right? Do I have that right?
- DUANE: Dieter.
- No.
- Dieter.
- No.
Oh, God.
Come on, Dieter, open the cuffs.
No.
You, you are on my list right after Crazy Horse.
Cut that crap, you know?
Because I will do you in two seconds flat.
- Okay. - Hey, hey, hey. You are on my list.
On my list.
No food.
Go away, there's no food today.
No food.
Dieter.
- You should apologize.
- Okay.
I was just making a point.
DUANE: You should apologize to Gene.
You are not gonna keep me prisoner. I said you are not gonna keep me prisoner.
Oh, and you are not the one that I'm afraid of, okay, because the man who will frighten me has to be born yet.
- Come on, apologize.
- Okay?
Okay.
Gene, I apologize.
Gene.
Gene.
Hey, I'm really sorry.
Okay?
I'm sorry.
Okay.
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)
(SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Motherfucker!
I think they believe we call in aircraft.
- DUANE: (CRYING) I can't take this.
- Duane. Duane.
- You hang in.
- I can't take it anymore.
You hang in.
I'm your true friend.
I'm your true friend. I would not lie to you.
I will never let you down, okay?
- Okay.
- Never.
(WHISPERING) Hey.
So, listen.
Once we have got the guards, we are gonna set up a perimeter.
If reinforcements come along this jungle path... (SHUSHING)
They're having some kind of discussion in the kitchen.
I understand what they are saying. I just need to hear.
Hey, what's going on?
Silence.
So what are they saying?
What they're discussing is this.
They sent some villagers out to forage for some rice.
- Yeah? - They came back with nothing.
Ever since the bombings, the entire province cannot grow rice.
I didn't think it could get any worse.
No, it's much worse than that.
They plan to march us out in the jungle and kill us, and make it look as if we were trying to escape.
They wanna all go back to their villages and somehow try to get some food.
The ringleaders are Little Hitler and Crazy Horse.
- I knew it.
- Okay, so it has to be tomorrow.
Come here.
Procet.
We are still a day short of Independence Day, but so what.
Hey, there's no rain.
Tomorrow, chow time.
DIETER: So then, Duane and I will go this way outside of the fence.
The four of you will go this way outside of the fence.
And we must all arrive at the kitchen at the same moment to encircle them.
This is the most important thing, okay?
And then you two, you will interrogate the guards.
Okay. Where the hell is the tower?
Where's the tower?
Okay. Yes.
Those three are in the kitchen.
I think that is it.
I think they're all in the kitchen, I think.
This is it. I'm going.
Dieter, good luck.
Quiet, quiet.
Quickly. Kitchen.
Kitchen. Meet us at the kitchen. Yes?
Duane, come on. Come on. Oh, God.
Oh, God, there are six or seven or something.
Gene!
Procet!
Come on!
DIETER:
Procet!
Gene! Where the hell are you?
Gene!
Damn you, where are...
Duane, come on!
Duane, where the hell are you!
Jumbo, don't try anything.
Go on!
Go on, run!
Run!
God damn you!
Where are the shoes?
The shoes are always hanging here.
Look for them!
Go on, look for them.
This is terrible.
This is terrible.
Come on. Get something.
Get this bag.
- There's no shoes.
- Get this bag.
Get as much as you can.
God damn you, Gene!
God damn you!
We have to leave. We have to leave.
The guards will be coming back.
Come on.
Duane.
Duane.
Not in the open.
Not in the open. Come on.
Come on.
Dieter.
Y. C., what the hell happened?
Why didn't you show up at the kitchen?
Gene?
Gene, where the hell were you?
Gene, where the hell have you been?
Did you hear the shooting?
Did you?
I couldn't get a shot.
Oh, you couldn't get a shot at them.
You weren't there to get a shot at them.
Look at these. What nice shoes you have.
Where are our shoes?
Where are our shoes?
Phisit.
You're telling me that he took three pairs of shoes?
He took his, he took Duane's and he took mine?
- That's right.
- DIETER: Yeah.
- Yeah. - DIETER:
That's right.
So, you were busy getting your machetes and your nice shoes while we were being shot at.
Okay. Where was this rifle?
Where did you find this rifle?
Where'd you get that?
Where am I gonna go?
I don't know where you're gonna go.
Where'd you get the rifle?
Or did you just find that?
You just found it lying around?
We found it.
Okay, listen, that's it.
Listen, I have an ammo clip for you.
My ammo clip for your machete.
Oh, yeah.
DIETER: Oh, that's funny?
- 'Cause I was just thinking, maybe you'll go back and get one yourself.
Maybe I'll go back and get one myself? Okay.
GENE:
Happy now you got to do your big plan?
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, I bet you're happy.
You hand me that machete.
You hand me that machete.
You tell me where to go.
You tell me where to go.
I don't know where you can go.
I didn't think so.
Didn't think so.
Gene. Gene.
What's that?
What's that?
Yeah, Dieter.
Is that where you're going?
See you, Duane. Duane, love you, brother.
You go that way, I'll go this way.
But where am I gonna go?
I'm gonna go over there.
Where am I gonna go?
Where am I gonna go?
Dieter.
It's gonna rain.
I know it.
This is how it always starts.
(SCREAMING)
DIETER: Duane.
Look at this.
You see over there?
See?
Down there must be a river.
It must lead to the Big Muddy.
And then we'll be out of here.
DIETER: We'll build a raft, and we can float all the way down to it.
No one will see us.
Then we can cross over into Thailand.
Listen.
Do you hear that?
Is that a waterfall?
Waterfall!
Waterfall, bail out!
Dieter!
Dieter!
- Careful!
- The shore!
Grab the shore!
Hey, pick a hand.
No.
Which one of your feet is worse off?
That's a trick question, right?
We can trade off with this thing.
There's no way that we shoot it out with the Vietcong if we run into them, so...
And we can't use these for hunting because of the noise.
You wanna ditch them?
Yeah.
I'm sick of carrying these, anyway.
(GROANING)
Oh, God.
Duane.
We got to move.
I'm too tired.
- Keep moving.
- No, I'm too tired.
Come on, buddy.
I can't go on any longer.
Duane.
Duane.
These are huts.
This is an abandoned village.
This is a hut.
No.
- Yeah.
- It's all jungle.
Be careful.
- I'm done.
- No.
DIETER: Travel by night.
No, I'm telling you, I can't go any further.
You just leave me here.
We'll travel by night.
I help you along.
When we reach the Big Muddy, we'll make it across, and I'm sure we're gonna run right into an American officers' club.
And we're gonna go straight into the kitchen, and we're gonna order a burger and French fries and milkshake and ice cream sundaes.
All that sweet stuff that you like.
(HELICOPTERS APPROACHING)
Duane!
Duane!
There's choppers!
Duane!
Duane, look!
There's...
Oh, here we are!
Here we are!
Oh, please!
Please, be real!
Here we are!
It's your buddies!
It's your buddies!
Oh, yes!
Thank you!
Thank you!
We're here!
We're here!
No!
We're here!
Where are you going?
We are here!
Stop!
You idiots, where are you going?
Please.
Please.
Please come back.
Please come back.
- Keep your voice down.
- Duane.
- Dieter.
- Duane.
- The guards are coming.
- Duane,
I'm not speaking.
I'm not speaking.
God, why don't you help us when we need you most?
Keep your voice down. They're coming.
(SHIVERING)
Come here.
Lie down.
Lie down there.
Lie down.
Okay.
Listen, I'm gonna build a fire tonight, a big one.
And those helicopters, they will see it.
And they will come for us.
Okay, they will come for us.
Come on, come on.
Yes.
DIETER: (SHOUTING) Here we are!
Here we are!
Oh, yes!
Oh, thank God!
Oh, yes!
Yeah!
Yes!
(MACHINE GUN firing)
You idiots!
You almost killed me!
I dreamed there was a fire.
Why did they think a whole damn village would be burning?
How could we be Vietcong?
Now they must've heard us.
They must've seen this.
The Vietcong will be on their way. They could be here any moment.
Let's leave here.

Hey, you!
I'm here!
Please turn around.
Hey!
Don't leave. Hey!
Hey!

Don't go away.
Don't go away.
Hey!

Okay. Hey!

MAN: Who are you, buddy?
Name?
Flight Lieutenant Dieter Dengler, U.S.S. Ranger.
Authenticator?
- What's your authenticator?
- Rescue Dawn.
- Rescue Dawn.
- Louder!
Rescue Dawn!
- Favorite sport?
- Hunting.
Favorite fish?
Trout.
Confirmed. Confirmed. It's him!
I can't believe it.
Jesus, buddy, you made it out of the bush.
Bring him home!
He's coming home with us.
- Oh, shit!
- Going home.
All right.
Way to go, buddy.
MAN:
Easy, easy, easy.
Hold up here, hold up here.
Hey, everyone listen to me.
- We're in charge here.
- Back up. Back up.
This man has been on a highly classified operation. Hold.
No one is to see him. No one is to touch him.
No one is to talk to him.
AGENT 2: Get him inside. AGENT 1:
AGENT 1: In fact, from now on, it's a black operation. Is that clear?
You got me on that?
AGENT 2: Back up. Back up.
AGENT 1: Stand back.
All right. Let's go.
NURSE: You're doing great, Dieter.
You don't need this anymore.
(WHISPERING) Hey, when can I go back to my ship?
I don't know.
Okay, go, go, go, go, go.
You guys are a lot of fun.
You know, how many times I have to tell you?
I don't know the coordinates.
Let's go back to the guards.
Tell me about their uniforms.
There were some with red stars, maybe they're Vietcong.
The others were Laotians...
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Dieter!
There's my buddies.
- Happy birthday.
- That's my buddies.
You made it.
It's good to see you, Spook.
Dieter.
Norman. Oh, my God.
Gentlemen, can you give us a couple of minutes alone, please?
It should be all right.
I got a little letter from his fiancée.
It's kind of personal. You know what I mean?
Keep it personal, Lieutenant.
We're in the middle of a highly classified debriefing.
Will do. It's from his old lady.
- Ten minutes.
- Okay.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Hey, Spook, what's with the birthday...
It's not my birthday.
Dieter, those two CIA dudes wanna take you back to Guam for debriefing.
You don't wanna do that, do you?
I didn't think so.
Hey, hold on, guys.
Hey, guys, he's a bit choked up in there.
You mind giving him just a couple of minutes to sort of pull himself together?
Yeah, it should be fine.
We'll give it a few minutes.
- He's a good kid, huh?
- Yeah.
- Thanks, guys.
- Yup.
MAN:... Right, left. Left, left, left, right, left.
Come on, now.
Hurry up. Come on, get him in.
Get him in now, fast!
Get inside.
(WHOOPING) It's my day!
What are we doing?
DIETER: Hey.
SPOOK: What?
DIETER: Where is everybody?
- Where?
- Right here.
Why the decks...
They're empty.
Have they gone home?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
They're on vacation.
Is the war over?
No.
DIETER: You know I'm in a lot of trouble.
Boys, here he is.
They kidnapped him, they brought him here to us.
The CIA held him for four days but they can't hang onto him forever!
Dieter Dengler!
All right, all right.
Hold on.
Hold on a second.
Boys, listen up for a second.
Admiral Willoughby's got something to say.
Lieutenant Dengler.
Good to have you back.
- Thank you.
- All right. That's not all.
There's more! Hold on, fellows.
Hold on, hold on!
So, let's start with the man himself.
Dieter, it is just incredible you made it home.
Now, tell us, was it your faith in God and country?
Come on, Dieter, you got to believe in something.
I believe I need a steak.
A steak!
This guy needs a steak!
We're grilling up a big old cow for you.
All right. Hey, listen up. Hang on.
Can you pass something on to the boys?
You know, something you learned during your ordeal, something to keep them going no matter how bad it gets?
Sure I can.
Empty what is full.
Fill what is empty.
Scratch where it itches.
That's it.
Now look at these boys ' faces.
Do they love you, man!
Do they love you!
"A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."
The heart for Smoke Frog.
Thank you.
This liver for Curl Nose.
Thank you.
Cocoa Leaf the ears.
Thank you.
And for you Blunted the balls.
Not again.
I'm helping you.
Then you eat them!
I don't need them.
Nobody else does either.
Do you fellows?
No.
Of course not!
Sometimes!
What do you think?
No!
No, no!
But how many times does it take?
I have eight older sisters and one brother.
Father had tapir balls all ten times.
Shall I tell him?
I'm sorry.
The balls are useless.
You've never had them?
Couldn't say what they taste like.
None of you?
No, but it was fun watching you.
This was your idea.
Get him off me!
Calm down!
Why do you let them treat you like this?
Be strong.
Where is your pride?
It all works, doesn't it?
Yes.
I just can't make children.
I will tell you something, but I warn you, it's powerful.
What do you speak of?
The soanzo leaf.
The soanzo leaf?
From the marshes in the south.
This gave me my ten children.
No! No! Wait.
You rub them on... down there.
Just before you next try.
Apply it generously.
I don't know how to thank you.
If this works, maybe she'll stop bothering me.
Your wife?
No, her mother.
The old hag wants grandchildren.
Give me some meat.
Here, work on this pure meat ball breath.
What do you want?
What do you want?
I am Flint Sky.
I have hunted this forest from the day I came of age.
My father hunted this forest with me and before me.
Jaguar Paw, my son.
He hunts this forest with me.
He will hunt it with his son after I am gone.
A good catch?
Good waters here.
The forest gives much here.
We ask only to pass through.
Pass.
Keep safe as you pass.
Let's go.
Our lands were ravaged.
We seek a new beginning.
Your lands were ravaged?
Yes.
We seek a new beginning.
Be still.
My son!
Be still.
Back to the village.
I ask you not to speak of what you saw in the forest today.
You are troubled.
Yes, I am.
Those people in the forest, what did you see in them?
I do not understand.
Fear.
Deep rotting fear.
They were infected by it.
Did you see?
Fear is a sickness.
It will crawl into the soul of anyone who contracts it.
It has tainted your peace already.
I did not raise you to see you live in fear.
Strike it from your heart.
Do not bring it into our village.
At first light, we will gather with the elders at the sacred hill of our fathers.
There we will call on their spirits to guide us.
Oh here he is!
The big lump!
He's useless.
He can't do it.
You!
Yes you!
With your height and your girth you deceived us.
Get inside!
Damn you!
Get in there!
Old woman, please.
Move it!
You don't work!
What are you laughing at!
Give me a grandchild or we will replace you.
Mother, that's enough.
Do not come out until you make a child.
Two would be better!
What?
Twins, you oaf.
Mother.
Can you go away?
He says he can't with you sitting there.
Just get busy.
Mom...
She's gone.
Mother, what should we have at the feast tonight?
I have tapir, but I also found this boy.
I say boy.
Roasted!
The tapir smells better.
I think it's fresher.
No, Dad! It's me!
I'll just hang the boy here in case we change our minds.
Wait.
That's our Turtles Run.
He's our eldest.
Yes, it's me. Your eldest!
In that case, a hug for my eldest
and for my youngest.
Tapir it is!
One day, old man!
One day you won't be able to run!
And a man sat alone.
Drenched deep in sadness.
All the animals drew near to him and said:
"We do not like to see you so sad.
Ask us for whatever you wish, and you shall have it."
The Man said, "I want to have good sight."
The vulture replied:"You shall have mine."
The Man said,"I want to be strong."
The jaguar said,
"You shall be strong like me."
Then the Man said: "I long to know the secrets of the earth."
The serpent replied, "I will show them to you."
And so it went with all the animals.
And when the Man had all the gifts that they could give, he left.
The owl said to the other animals,
"Now the Man knows much and is able to do many things.
Suddenly I am afraid."
The deer said:
"The Man has all that he needs.
Now his sadness will cease."
But the owl replied: "No.
I saw a hole in the Man, deep like a hunger he will never satisfy.
It is what makes him sad and what makes him want.
He will go on taking and taking, until one day the World will say,
I am no more and I have nothing left to give."
Come back.
Come back to me.
My son is dancing.
Your son is happy.
What do you want?
Run!
Now you're up, would you kill that dog?
The dog.
Get up!
Go to the forest.
Run!
Do not look back.
No!
I am afraid!
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes.
Be strong.
I am afraid!
Be strong.
Tie him up!
Father!
The others. I have to help.
No, don't leave us!
I'll come back, I promise.
Don't go!
I promise.
Stay, please stay.
Father, don't go.
Very nice.
Stop!
Tie him up!
I want him alive.
Sorry, Father.
That's enough!
Stand him up.
Move away.
My son.
Don't be afraid.
Almost that's your name.
"Almost".
Our life is over.
Shame.
Shame!
Cowards!
Let's move!
We move out now.
They're back.
Get up!
Heave!
Cut Rock, you forgot to duck.
Hold still.
Can you see?
Yes.
Get back to your line.
Come with us.
Get up.
Leave him alone, "Almost".
I said get up.
Up, up.
That's it.
Let's go!
This man is a good friend of yours.
Don't worry.
I'll take care of them.
They are mine now.
Gentle Ixchel, tender mother of mercy.
Keep them from harm. Please.
Keep them.
One more.
Ready?
Hold on!
Hold on!
Wait.
Let's see what happens.
That's it!
Hurry!
Pull! Be strong!
Yes! You did it!
Good work!
Can you breathe?
Good.
Wait here.
What's become of my capture?
Dead weight.
He nearly took the rest with him.
I let him go.
You let him go?
Now we do what you want?
Let us try that.
Don't let any others go.
Let's move.
Get up, "Almost".
We don't want to lose you just yet.
Stand up, boy.
You proved yourself today, my son.
You're now worthy to stand with the rest of us.
Thank you, Father.
Take it.
It's yours.
It has taken many lives.
Get some rest.
Rest, brothers, fathers, mothers, wives.
You felt the cold of this early morning.
Now you cannot feel the coldness of its night.
She stopped screaming, long before they returned, she had stopped screaming.
We saw how she fought them.
But in the final moment?
If she let them...
The Goddess of the Scaffold shows no mercy before weakness.
Her soul waits for yours in the shade of the Ceiba Tree.
I need to know.
Before this day's end I will leave this world.
I'll take as many of these bastard dogs with me as I can.
And I will gladly embrace the torments of hell
if I don't find my Sky Flower there.
Don't rain.
I am walking here.
Keep away, she has the sickness.
Get back!
You fear me.
So should all of you, the evil ones.
Would you like to know how you'll die?
The sacred time is near.
Beware the blackness of day.
Beware the man who brings the jaguar.
Behold him reborn from mud and earth.
For the one he takes you to will condemn the sky
and wipe out the earth.
He will wipe you out.
And end your world.
He's with us now.
Day will be like night.
And the jaguar man will lead you to your end.
Where are they taking us?
We tell stories of a stone-built place.
What happens there?
I do not know, but the earth bleeds.
We are near.
Salvation!
He has the laughing sickness.
He likes you!
Help me!
Save me.
Die like a man.
Welcome back.
Have you been successful?
Ask my son.
How many captives?
Deal with my son.
A fair price.
As always, trust me.
Good.
How much will you give me?
Who will buy this woman?
No, she's too old.
She can be useful.
She can cook, clean...
Useless old woman!
No one buys you.
Go!
Go on.
These are days of great sorrow.
The land thirsts.
A great plague infests our crops.
The scourge of sickness afflicts us at its whim.
They say this strife has made us weak.
That we have become empty.
They say that we rot.
Great people of the sun,
I say we are strong!
We are a people of destiny.
We are destined to be the masters of time.
Destined to be nearest to the gods.
Mighty Kukulkan, whose fury could scorch this earth to oblivion,
let us appease you with this sacrifice.
To exalt you in your glory.
To make our people prosper.
To prepare for your return.
Warrior, unafraid and willing!
With your blood you renew the world!
From age to age.
Thanks be to you.
The heart of god!
Come back to me.
Brother...
Journey well.
No.
I can't go.
Not now...
People of the sun, do not fear.
Rejoice!
Kulkukan has drunk his fill of blood.
We have quenched his thirst.
Great god.
Show us that you are pleased.
Let your light return upon us.
What of the captives?
Dispose of them.
I need a finisher.
You.
Release them.
You watch.
I'm ready!
There's your jungle, beyond the corn.
Go to it.
You're free.
Now run.
I said run.
Run!
Not bad.
Your turn.
Run.
Run!
Sleep.
Sleep, sleep now my son.
The pain will be no more.
Sleep.
He didn't come this way.
He's in the trees.
Spread out.
Keep your eyes open.
Quiet.
He's coming right at us.
There!
He would have wanted me to have it.
The omen is bad.
Mighty Ek Chuah, we beg you...
Forgive us for this trespass against your son the Jaguar.
The omen is bad.
Lift yourself up, Drunkards Four the omen was foretold and now we have a fear more grave.
Today I saw the day become like night.
I saw a man run with the Jaguar.
We must not let this man make feet from us.
Enough.
Your words mean nothing.
He runs because he is afraid.
When I catch him, I'll peel his skin
and have him watch me wear it.
We leave now.
Stay back.
Here!
The omen was bad.
He's fucked.
Help, please.
Hanging Moss.
See him out.
Open your veins.
It's quicker.
Travel well.
So much for your prophecies.
It's not over!
I am Jaguar Paw, son of Flint Sky.
My father hunted this forest before me...
My name is Jaguar Paw.
I am a hunter.
This is my forest.
And my sons will hunt it with their sons after I am gone.
Come on!
We are going over.
We will climb down.
We cannot let him get away.
We cannot allow it.
We all jump.
I am Jaguar Paw.
This is my forest.
And I am not afraid.
You go. I'll wait here.
Almost...
Resting fathers, fly me your strength.
Get up here.
Go back!
Quick!
Hurry up!
What are they?
They bring men.
Should we go to them?
We should go to the forest.
To seek a new beginning.
Come, Turtles Run.
I'd never given much thought to how I would die.
But dying in the place of someone I love seems like a good way to go.
So I can't bring myself to regret the decision to leave home.
I would miss Phoenix.
I'd miss the heat.
I would miss my loving, erratic, harebrained mother.
Okay.
And her new husband.
Guys, come on.
I love you both.
We got a plane to catch.
But they want to go on the road, so I'm gonna spend some time with my dad, and this will be a good thing.
When the thorn bush turns white
That's when I'll come home
I am going out to see what I can sow
And I don't know where I'll go
And I don't know what I'll see
In the state of Washington, under a near constant cover of clouds and rain, there's a small town named Forks.
Population, 3,120 people.
This is where I'm moving.
My dad's Charlie.
He's the chief of police.
Curse the powers that be
Cause all I want is...
Your hair's longer.
I cut it since the last time I saw you.
Guess it grew out again.
I used to spend two weeks here almost every summer, but it's been years.
I've cleared some shelves off in the bathroom.
Right.
One bathroom.
It's a pretty good work lamp.
The sales lady picked out the bed stuff.
You like purple, right?
Purple's cool.
Thanks.
Okay.
One of the best things about Charlie, he doesn't hover.
Heard you guys coming all the way down the road.
Good to see you.
Bella, you remember Billy Black.
- Wow, you're looking good.
- Well, I'm still dancing.
I'm glad you're finally here.
Charlie here hasn't shut up about it since you told him you were coming.
All right, keep exaggerating.
I'll roll you into the mud.
After I ram you in the ankles.
You want to go?
Bring it.
- Hi, I'm Jacob.
- Hey.
We used to make mud pies when we were little.
Right.
No, I remember.
Are they always like this?
- It's getting worse with old age. - Good.
So, what do you think?
Of what?
- Your homecoming present. - This?
- Just bought it off Billy here.
- Yep.
- I totally rebuilt the engine for you. - Come on.
Oh, my gosh!
This is perfect.
Are you joking me?
Sorry.
I told you she'd love it.
I'm down with the kids.
Oh, yeah, dude. You're the bomb.
Okay.
Listen, you gotta double-pump the clutch when you shift, but besides that, you should be good.
- That's this one?
- Yeah, right there.
All right.
Do you want a ride to school or something?
I go to school on the reservation.
Right, right.
That's too bad.
It would've been nice to know one person.
My first day at a new school.
It's March, middle of the semester.
Great.
- Nice ride.
- Thanks.
Good one.
You're Isabella Swan, the new girl.
Hi, I'm Eric, the eyes and ears of this place.
Anything you need, tour guide, lunch date, shoulder to cry on?
I'm really kind of the more suffer-in-silence type.
Good headline for your feature.
I'm on the paper, and you're news, baby, front page.
No, I'm not.
You... Please don't have any sort of...
Chillax.
No feature.
- Okay, thanks.
- Cool?
All right.
Okay.
Get it! Get it!
Get it!
To you!
I'm sorry.
I told them not to let me play.
No way.
No, no, no.
That's...
That's... Don't...
You're Isabella, right?
Just Bella.
Hey, I'm Mike Newton.
- Nice to meet you. - Yeah, yeah.
- She's got a great spike, huh?
- Yeah, it's...
I'm Jessica, by the way.
Hey, you're from Arizona, right?
Aren't people from Arizona supposed to be, like, really tan?
Maybe that's why they kicked me out.
You're good.
That's so funny.
- Back in, Jess.
- Down here.
Like a masterpiece, you know, we'll have, like, this crazy pyramid fall from the sky,
- and then you guys can...
- It's my pleasure, Madame.
- You guys can give each other high fives.
- Burrito, my friend?
- Hey, Mikey! You met my home girl, Bella? - Hey.
Your home girl?
- That's...
- My girl.
Sorry I had to mess up your game, Mike!
Tyler.
Yes!
Oh, my God.
It's like first grade all over again.
You're the shiny new toy.
Smile.
- Okay.
- Sorry.
I needed a candid for the feature.
The feature's dead, Angela.
Don't bring it up again.
It's okay, I just...
I got your back, baby.
Guess we'll just run another editorial on teen drinking.
You know, you can always go for eating disorders.
Speedo padding on the swim team.
Actually, that's a good one.
Kirk.
Right? That's exactly what I thought.
We're talking Olympic-size.
There's no way. He's so skinny.
It doesn't make sense.
Totally.
Who are they?
The Cullens.
They're Dr. and Mrs. Cullen's foster kids.
They moved down here from Alaska, like, a few years ago.
They kind of keep to themselves.
Yeah, 'cause they're all together.
Like, together, together.
The blonde girl, that's Rosalie, and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett, they're, like, a thing.
I'm not even sure that's legal.
Jess, they're not actually related.
Yeah, but they live together.
It's weird.
And, okay, the little dark-haired girl's Alice.
She's really weird, and she's with Jasper, the blond one who looks like he's in pain.
Dr. Cullen's like this foster dad/matchmaker.
Maybe he'll adopt me.
Who's he?
That's Edward Cullen.
He's totally gorgeous, obviously, but apparently nobody here's good enough for him.
Like I care, you know?
So, yeah.
Seriously, like, don't waste your time.
I wasn't planning on it.
- Mr. Molina.
- Hey, Mike.
Oh, yes.
Miss Swan.
Hi.
Can I have the pass?
Thank you.
Welcome to the class.
Here. Here's your stuff, okay?
And I got a seat for you right here, so come over.
The last one.
Just follow along till you catch up.
All right, guys, today we are gonna be observing the behavior of planaria, aka flatworms.
So what we're gonna do regenerate.
Zombie worms.
No cell phones.
Guys, let's get to it.
Gentle, gentle, certain areas.
Please just don't cut here.
We don't cut here.
You won't believe this.
Let's try to focus while we check those out, huh, guys?
There must be something open.
- Physics? Biochem?
- No, every class is full.
Just a minute, dear.
I'm afraid you'll have to stay in biology.
Fine.
Just... I'll just have to endure it.
I just can't get over how grown up you are.
And so gorgeous.
Hey, Bella.
You remember me?
I played Santa one year.
Yeah, Waylon, she hasn't had a Christmas here since she was four.
I bet I made an impression, though, didn't I?
- You always do.
- Butt-crack Santa?
Hey, kids love those little bottles, though.
All right, let the girl eat her garden burger, Waylon.
As soon as you're done, I will bring you your favorite.
Berry cobbler, remember?
Your dad still has it.
Every Thursday.
Thank you.
That'd be great.
Here.
Thanks.
Hey, baby. So, listen, if spring training goes well, we could be moving to Florida.
Please insert $1.25 for an additional three minutes.
Mom, where's your cell?
Okay, don't laugh.
I didn't lose my power cord.
It ran away.
Screaming.
I literally repel technology now.
- I miss you.
- Oh, baby, I miss you, too.
But tell me more about your school.
Now, what are the kids like?
Are there any cute guys?
Are they being nice to you?
Well, they're all very welcoming.
Tell me all about it.
It doesn't even matter.
Yes, it does, honey.
I have homework to do.
I'll talk to you later.
Okay.
I love you.
Love you, too.
I planned to confront him and demand to know what his problem was.
But he never showed.
Bella!
And the next day, another no-show.
More days passed.
Things were getting a little strange.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.
Ice doesn't really help the uncoordinated.
That's why I had some new tires put on the truck.
Old ones were getting pretty bald.
Well, probably be late for dinner.
I gotta head down to Mason County.
Security guard at the Grisham Mill got killed by some kind of animal.
An animal?
You're not in Phoenix anymore, Bells.
Anyway, I figured I'd lend a hand.
- Be careful.
- Always am.
And thanks for the tires.
Prom Committee is a chick thing, but I gotta cover it for the paper anyway, and they need a guy to help choose the music, so I need your play list.
Hey, listen, I was wondering, did you have a date to...
What's up, Arizona? Huh?
How you liking the rain, girl?
Better get used to it, girl.
Yeah, Mike, hey, you're real cute, man.
- Oh, I know...
- That was really awesome.
Why you shooting down my game?
Let a playa play.
Yeah, okay.
What you playing at, T-Ball?
Hello.
I'm sorry, I didn't get a chance to introduce myself last week.
I'm Edward Cullen.
You're Bella?
Yes.
Onion root tip cells, that's what's on your slides right now.
Okay?
So, separate and label them into the phases of mitosis, and the first partners that get it right are gonna win the Golden Onion.
All right, good.
Ladies first.
You were gone.
I was out of town for a couple of days.
Personal reasons.
Prophase.
Do you mind if I look?
It's prophase.
Like I said.
So are you enjoying the rain?
What?
You're asking me about the weather?
Yeah, I...
I guess I am.
Well, I don't really like the rain.
Any cold, wet thing, I don't really...
- What?
- Nothing.
It's anaphase.
- You mind if I check?
- Sure.
Anaphase.
Like I said.
If you hate the cold and the rain so much, why'd you move to the wettest place in the continental US?
It's complicated.
I'm sure I can keep up.
My mom remarried, and...
So you don't like the guy, or...
No, that's not...
Phil's really nice.
It's metaphase.
You want to check it?
I believe you.
Why didn't you move with your mother and Phil?
Well, Phil's a minor league baseball player, and he travels a lot, and my mom stayed home with me, but I knew it made her unhappy, so I figured I'd stay with my dad for a while.
And now you're unhappy.
- No.
- I'm sorry, I'm just...
I'm just trying to figure you out.
You're very difficult for me to read.
Hey, did you get contacts?
No.
Your eyes were black the last time I saw you, and now they're, like, golden brown.
Yeah, I know, it's the...
It's the fluorescents.
- Bella! - Bella!
Dial 911!
I already called.
They're gonna send somebody over soon.
Bella, I'm so sorry.
I panicked.
Bella, I've got 911 on the phone now.
Bella.
You okay?
You and I are gonna talk.
You all right?
I'm fine, Dad.
Calm down.
I'm sorry, Bella.
I tried to stop.
I know.
It's okay.
No.
It sure as hell is not okay.
Dad, it wasn't his fault.
You could've been killed.
You understand that?
Yes.
But I wasn't, so...
You can kiss your license goodbye.
- I heard the chief's daughter was here.
- Dr. Cullen.
Charlie.
I've got this one, Jackie.
Isabella.
Bella.
Well, Bella, looks like you took quite a spill.
How do you feel?
Good.
Look here.
You might experience some post-traumatic stress or disorientation, but your vitals look good.
No signs of any head trauma.
I think you'll be just fine.
I'm so sorry, Bella.
I'm really...
You know, it would've been a whole lot worse if Edward wasn't there.
He knocked me out of the way.
Edward?
Your boy?
Yeah, it was amazing.
I mean, he got to me so fast.
He was nowhere near me.
Sounds like you were very lucky.
Charlie.
I gotta go sign some paperwork.
You should...
You should probably call your mom.
Did you tell her?
She's probably just freaking out.
fifteen kids that saw what happened.
What was I supposed to do, then?
Let her die?
This isn't just about you.
It's about all of us.
I think we should take this in my office.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Rosalie.
What?
How did you get over to me so fast?
I was standing right next to you, Bella.
No.
You were next to your car, across the lot.
No, I wasn't.
Yes, you were.
Bella, you're...
You hit your head.
I think you're confused.
I know what I saw.
And what exactly was that?
You...
You stopped the van.
You pushed it away with your hand.
Well, nobody's gonna believe you, so...
I wasn't gonna tell anybody.
I just need to know the truth.
Can't you just thank me and get over it?
Thank you.
- You're not gonna let this go, are you?
- No.
Well, then I hope you enjoy disappointment.
And that was the first night I dreamt of Edward Cullen.
I need everybody's permission slips, okay?
Sammy, please collect them.
Guys, let's go.
Come on, get in.
Let's go!
Look at you, huh?
You're alive.
I know, yeah.
False alarm, I guess.
Now, I wanted to ask you, you know, if, you know, it's like a month away, but...
Do you wanna go to prom with me?
So, what do you think?
- About what?
- Do you want to go?
To prom?
With me?
I...
Prom.
Dancing.
Not such a good idea for me.
I have something that weekend anyway.
I'm going to Jacksonville that weekend.
You can't go another weekend?
Non-refundable ticket.
You should ask Jessica.
I know she wants to go with you.
All right.
All right.
Yo, yo, yo. Hey, guys, come on.
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
Green is what? Good.
Let's go.
Guys, come on.
Other bus, other bus.
Let's go.
Egg shells, carrot tops.
Compost is cool.
Now, stuff that in there, Eric.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Very good, very good.
Now, I am gonna make a steaming cup of compost tea.
- Okay.
- Give me that.
This is recycling in its most basic form, guys.
Don't drink it!
It's for the plants.
What's in Jacksonville?
How did you know about that?
You didn't answer my question.
You don't answer any of mine, so...
I mean, you don't even say hi to me.
Hi.
Are you gonna tell me how you stopped the van?
I had an adrenaline rush.
It's very common.
You can Google it.
Floridians.
That's what's in Jacksonville.
Can you at least watch where you walk?
Look, I'm sorry I'm being rude all the time.
I just think it's the best way.
Bella!
Guess who just asked me to prom.
Who?
Yeah, I actually totally thought that Mike was gonna ask you.
- It's not gonna be weird, though, right?
- No.
Zero weirdness.
- You guys are great together.
- I know, right?
- Tyler...
- Gross.
Bella, look. It's a worm.
It's a worm.
Bella, we shouldn't be friends.
You really should've figured that out a little earlier.
I mean, why didn't you just let the van crush me and save yourself all this regret?
What, you think I regret saving you?
I can see that you do. I just...
I don't know why.
You don't know anything.
Hi.
Are you gonna be riding with us?
No, our bus is full.
Your mom called.
Again.
Well, that's your fault.
You shouldn't have told her about the "almost" accident.
You finished?
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
She always did know how to worry.
She seems different.
She seems happy.
Phil sounds like an all right guy.
Yeah, he is.
All right.
No, you need the mitts.
You need them.
No, why do you keep arguing with me?
You just need them.
- You're gonna get frostbite!
- I don't even know.
Hey!
- La Push, baby.
You in?
- Should I know what that means?
La Push Beach down at the Quileute Rez.
We're all going tomorrow.
- Yeah, there's a big swell coming in.
- And I don't just surf the Internet.
Eric, you stood up once, and it was a foam board.
But there's whale watching, too.
Come with us.
La Push, baby.
It's La Push.
Okay, I'll go if you stop saying that, okay?
Seriously, dude.
It's creepy, man.
- What?
That's what it's called.
- So...
Edible art?
Bella.
Thanks.
You know, your mood swings are kind of giving me whiplash.
I only said it'd be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't wanna be.
What does that mean?
It means if you were smart, you'd stay away from me.
Okay, well, let's say for argument's sake that I'm not smart.
- Would you tell me the truth?
- No, probably not.
I'd rather hear your theories.
I have considered radioactive spiders and Kryptonite.
That's all superhero stuff, right?
What if I'm not the hero?
What if I'm the bad guy?
You're not.
I can see what you're trying to put off, but I can see that it's just to keep people away from you.
It's a mask.
Why don't we just hang out?
Everybody's going to the beach.
Come.
I mean, have fun.
- Which beach?
- La Push.
I don't know.
I just...
Is there something wrong with that beach?
It's just a little crowded.
- Hey, it's freezing.
- I'm paddling out, Coates.
- I don't know if it's worth it anymore.
- We drove all the way out here.
I'm at least paddling out.
- She's right.
- You guys are babies.
So, I keep thinking that Eric's gonna ask me to the prom, and then he just doesn't.
You should ask him.
Take control.
You're a strong, independent woman.
- I am?
- Yes.
Hey, will you do me up?
- Bella!
- Hi, Jacob.
- Guys, this is Jacob.
- Hey, guys. How you doing?
- Hi.
- Hi.
What are you, like, stalking me?
You're on my rez, remember?
Are you surfing?
- Definitely not.
- Thanks.
You guys should keep Bella company.
Her date bailed.
What date?
She invited Edward.
- To be polite, that's it.
- I think it's nice she invited him.
- Nobody ever does.
- Yeah, 'cause Cullen's a freak.
You got that right.
You guys know him?
The Cullens don't come here.
What did your friends mean about, you know, "The Cullens don't come here?"
You caught that, huh?
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.
Hey, I can keep a secret.
Really, it's just like an old scary story.
Well, I want to know.
Okay, did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?
What?
Like, wolves?
Like, real wolves?
Well, that's the legend of our tribe.
Okay.
So what's the story about the Cullens?
Well, they're supposedly descended from this, like, enemy clan.
My great grandfather, the chief, found them hunting on our land.
But they claimed to be something different, so we made a treaty with them.
If they promised to stay off Quileute lands, then we wouldn't expose what they really were to the palefaces.
I thought they just moved here.
Or just moved back.
Right.
It touched my hand. A snake!
Stop!
Well, what are they really?
It's just a story, Bella.
Come on, let's go.
A snake!
A snake!
My mama said I didn't know how to make a kitty meow
Hello?
Gerald?
Gerald?
Hello.
Nice jacket.
Who are you?
It's always the same inane questions.
"Who are you?"
"What do you want?"
"Why are you doing this?"
James, let's not play with our food.
He's not here.
Whenever the weather's nice, the Cullens disappear.
What, do they just ditch?
No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank them out for, like, hiking and camping and stuff.
I tried that out on my parents. Not even close.
Guys, I'm going to the prom with Eric.
- I just asked him. I took control.
- I told you that would happen.
Are you sure you have to go out of town?
Oh, yeah, it's a little family thing.
Okay, we should go shopping in Port Angeles before all the good dresses get cleaned out.
Port Angeles?
You mind if I come?
Yeah, I need your opinion.
- I like this one.
- That's cool.
But, like, I don't know about the one-shoulder thing.
- I like this one.
- Yeah, I like the beading,
- and you wouldn't need jewelry.
- Jess, what do you think? Lavender?
- Is that good?
Is that my color?
- I like it.
I liked that dusty rose one, too.
Okay, I like this one.
It makes my boobs look good.
- Hey.
- Right?
Nice.
- Oh, God.
- That is uncomfortable.
That's disgusting.
Bella, what do you think?
Yes?
That looks great.
You said that about, like, the last five dresses, though.
I thought they were all pretty good.
You're not really into this, are you?
I actually really just want to go to this bookstore.
I'll meet you guys at the restaurant?
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.
I'll see you in a minute.
- Okay.
- Okay.
She's right, though.
This looks awesome.
There you go.
- Have a good night.
- Thank you.
- Saw you in the dress store.
- Hey, where you running to?
There she is.
- What's up?
- It's my girl.
- How you guys doing?
- Look who we just found.
What's up, girl? Hey...
Where you going?
- Where are you going?
- Come get a drink with us.
- Yeah, you should hang out with us. - Come on.
It's fun.
- What's the problem?
- She doesn't like that, man.
- You're pretty.
- Don't touch me.
- Cute. - Really, no.
Seriously, you should.
Don't touch me.
Get in the car.
That was a very dangerous maneuver.
I should go back there and rip those guys' heads off.
No, you shouldn't.
You don't know the vile, repulsive things they were thinking.
And you do?
It's not hard to guess.
Can you talk about something else?
Distract me so I won't turn around.
You should put your seatbelt on.
You should put your seatbelt on.
- I thought the salad was pretty good.
- Hey, you guys, I'm sorry. I just...
Where were you?
We left you messages.
Yeah, we waited, but we were, like, starving, so we...
I'm sorry I kept Bella from dinner.
We just sort of ran into each other and got talking.
No.
No, we totally understand.
I mean, that happens, right?
Yeah, we were...
- We were, yeah, we were just leaving. So...
- Let's get this...
Bella, if you wanna...
I think I should make sure Bella gets something to eat.
If you'd like.
I'll drive you home myself.
That's so thoughtful.
It's really thoughtful.
I should eat something.
- Okay, so we'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay, yeah.
- See ya.
- Okay.
All right, one mushroom ravioli.
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.
So are you sure there isn't anything I can get for you?
No. No, thank you.
Let me know.
You're really not gonna eat?
No, I'm on a special diet.
You gotta give me some answers.
Yes, no.
To get to the other side.

I don't want to know what the square root of pi is.
You knew that?
How did you know where I was?
I didn't.
- All right.
- What?
Don't leave.
I...
Did you follow me?
I...
I feel very protective of you.
So you followed me.
I was trying to keep a distance unless you needed my help, and then I heard what those low-lifes were thinking.
Wait.
You say you heard what they were thinking?
So what, you...
You read minds?
I can read every mind in this room.
Apart from yours.
There's money, sex, money, sex, cat.
And then you, nothing.
It's very frustrating.
Is there something wrong with me?
See, I tell you I can read minds, and you think there's something wrong with you.
What is it?
I don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore.
Then don't.
Okay, I think I'm warm enough now.
Your hand is so cold.
What is going on?
My dad's still here.
Can you pull in?
That's my father's car on the end.
What is he doing here?
Carlisle, what's going on?
Waylon Forge was found in a boat out near his place.
- I just examined the body.
- He died?
- How?
- Animal attack.
Was it the same one that got that security guard down in Mason?
Most likely.
- Well, it's getting closer to town, then.
- Bella, you should go inside.
Waylon was your father's friend.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Dad, I'm really sorry.
I've known him going on 30 years.
Don't worry, we're gonna find this thing.
Meantime,
I want you to carry this with you.
- I don't know if you...
- It'll give your old man some peace of mind.
Okay.
Let's go home.
Cold One.
You're impossibly fast and strong.
Your skin is pale white and ice-cold.
Your eyes change color.
And sometimes you speak like you're from a different time.
You never eat or drink anything.
You don't go out in the sunlight.
How old are you?
Seventeen.
How long have you been 17?
A while.
I know what you are.
Say it.
Out loud.
Say it.
Vampire.
Are you afraid?
No.
Then ask me the most basic question.
What do we eat?
You won't hurt me.
Where are we going?
Up the mountain.
Out of the cloud bank.
You need to see what I look like in the sunlight.
This is why we don't show ourselves in sunlight.
People would know we're different.
This is what I am.
It's like diamonds.
You're beautiful.
Beautiful?
This is the skin of a killer, Bella.
I'm a killer.
I don't believe that.
That's because you believe the lie.
It's camouflage.
I'm the world's most dangerous predator.
Everything about me invites you in, my voice, my face, even my smell.
As if I would need any of that.
As if you could outrun me!
As if you could fight me off.
I'm designed to kill.
I don't care.
I've killed people before.
It does not matter.
I wanted to kill you.
I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life.
I trust you.
Don't.
I'm here. I trust you.
My family, we're different from others of our kind.
We only hunt animals.
We've learned to control our thirst.
But it's you, your scent, it's like a drug to me.
You're like my own personal brand of heroin.
Why did you hate me so much when we met?
I did.
Only for making me want you so badly.
I still don't know if I can control myself.
I know you can.
I can't read your mind.
You have to tell me what you're thinking.
Now I'm afraid.
Good.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm only afraid of losing you.
I feel like you're gonna disappear.
You don't know how long I've waited for you.
So the lion fell in love with the lamb.
What a stupid lamb.
What a sick, masochistic lion.
About three things I was absolutely positive.
First,
Edward was a vampire.
Second, there was a part of him, and I didn't know how dominant that part might be,
that thirsted for my blood.
And third,
I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.
Monte Carlo?
That's our prom theme?
Gambling, tuxedos, and Bond, James Bond.
Oh, my God.
You know, everybody's staring.
Not that guy.
No, he just looked.
I'm breaking all the rules now anyway.
Since I'm going to hell.
So, does a person have to be dying to become like you?
No, that's just Carlisle.
He'd never do this to someone who had another choice.
So, how long have you been like this?
Since 1918.
That's when Carlisle found me dying of Spanish influenza.
What was it like?
The venom was excruciating.
But what Carlisle did was much harder.
Not many of us have the restraint to do that.
But didn't he just have to bite?
Not exactly.
When we taste human blood, a sort of frenzy begins,
and it's almost impossible to stop.
But Carlisle did.
First with me and then with his wife, Esme.
So is Carlisle the real reason that you don't kill people?
No, he's not the only reason.
I don't want to be a monster.
My family, we think of ourselves as vegetarians, right, 'cause we only survive on the blood of animals.
But it's...
It's like a human only living on tofu.
It keeps you strong, but you're never fully satisfied.
It wouldn't be like drinking your blood, for instance.
Was it other vampires that killed Waylon?
There are others out there, and we run into them from time to time.
Can the rest of your family read people's minds like you can?
No.
That's just me.
But Alice can see the future.
I bet she saw me coming.
Alice's visions are subjective.
I mean, the future can always change.
Could you act human?
I mean, I've got neighbors.
I'm gonna take you to my place tomorrow.
Thanks.
Wait, like, with your family?
What if they don't like me?
So, you're worried not because you'll be in a house full of vampires, but because you think they won't approve of you?
I'm glad I amuse you.
What is it?
Complication.
I'll pick you up tomorrow.
Hey.
Come to visit your truck?
Looks good.
Got that dent out.
Actually, we came to visit your flat-screen.
First Mariners game of the season.
Plus Jacob here keeps bugging me about seeing you again.
Great, Dad. Thanks.
Just keeping it real, son.
Vitamin R.
Well done, Chief.
Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.
Good man.
Any luck with that Waylon case?
Well, I don't think it was an animal that killed him.
Never thought it was.
So spread the word out at the rez, huh?
Keep the kids out of the woods.
Will do.
Don't want no one else getting hurt, do we?
This is incredible.
It's so light and open, you know?
What did you expect, coffins and dungeons and moats?
No, not the moats.
Not the moats.
This is the one place we don't have to hide.
I told them not to do this.
You add a little bit of olive oil to a non-stick sauté pan, and you want to cook with the olive oil in medium-high heat.
What I do, I cut this in strips, and then we gonna cut this...
- Is she even Italian?
- Her name is Bella.
I'm sure she'll love it, no matter what.
Get a whiff of that.
Here comes the human.
Bella, we're making Italiano for you.
Bella, this is Esme.
My mother for all intents and purposes.
You've given us an excuse to use the kitchen for the first time.
I hope you're hungry.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- She already ate.
Perfect.
Yeah, it's just because I know that you guys don't eat...
Of course.
It's very considerate of you.
Just ignore Rosalie.
I do.
Let's just keep pretending like this isn't dangerous for all of us.
I would never tell anybody anything.
She knows that.
Yeah, well, the problem is, you two have gone public now, so...
Emmett.
No, she should know.
The entire family will be implicated if this ends badly.
Badly, as in...
I would become the meal.
Hi, Bella.
I'm Alice.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You do smell good.
Alice, what are you...
It's okay.
Bella and I are gonna be great friends.
Sorry, Jasper's our newest vegetarian.
It's a little difficult for him.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
It's okay, Jasper.
You won't hurt her.
All right, I'm gonna take you on a tour of the rest of the house.
- Okay.
- Well, I'll see you soon.
Okay.
- Cute!
- I know.
I think that went well.
Clean this up.
Now.
Was that as weird for you as it was for me?
I don't know.
Graduation caps?
It's a private joke.
We matriculate a lot.
That's kind of miserable.
I mean, repeating high school over and over.
True, but the younger we start out in a new place, the longer we can stay there.
Come on.
Yeah, this is my room.
No bed?
No, I don't...
I don't sleep.
- Ever?
- No, not at all.
Okay.
Boy, you have so much music.
What are you listening to?
It's Debussy.
I don't know...
Claire De Lune is great.
- What?
- I can't dance.
Well, I could always make you.
I'm not scared of you.
Well, you really shouldn't have said that.
You better hold on tight, spider monkey.
Do you trust me?
In theory.
Then close your eyes.
What?
This isn't real.
This kind of stuff just doesn't exist.
It does in my world.
Hold up.
It's human.
Arizona.
Yo, what's happening?
So you and Cullen, huh?
That's... I don't like it.
I mean, I don't know, he just looks at you like you're something to eat.
Here's your veggie plate, Stephenie.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Biology project.
I ordered you the spinach salad.
I hope that's okay.
You should order one for yourself next time.
Cut back on the steak.
Hey, I'm as healthy as a horse.
Say, Chief, boys want to know, did you find anything down by Queets River today?
Yeah, we found a bare human footprint, but it looks like whoever that is, is headed east, so Kitsap County sheriff is gonna take over from here.
- Okay. - Okay?
I just hope they catch him fast.
Looks like your friends are flagging you.
It's okay if you wanna go join them.
I'm just gonna turn in early anyway.
Me, too.
Bella, it's Friday night.
Go out.
Looks like the Newton boy's got a big smile for you.
Yeah, he's a good buddy.
What about any of these other yahoos in town?
Anybody interest you?
Dad, we gonna talk about boys?
Yeah, I guess not.
I just feel like I leave you alone too much.
You should be around people.
I don't really mind being alone.
I guess I'm kind of like my dad in that way.
So, how's all the baseball stuff going?
Phil's working so hard.
You know, spring training.
We're looking for a house to rent in case things become more permanent.
You'd like Jacksonville, baby.
I'm really liking Forks.
What?
Forks is growing on me.
Could a guy have anything to do with that?
Well, yeah.
I knew it.
Tell me everything.
What is he? Jock? Indie?
I bet he's smart.
Is he smart?
Mom, can I talk to you later?
Come on, we gotta talk boys.
Are you being safe?
How did you get in here?
The window.
Do you do that a lot?
Well, just the past couple of months.
I like watching you sleep.
It's kind of fascinating to me.
I always want to try one thing.
Just stay very still.
Don't move.
Stop it!
I'm sorry.
I'm stronger than I thought.
I wish I could say the same.
I can't ever lose control with you.
Hey, don't go.
- Hey, got you another one.
- Thanks.
I have a date with Edward Cullen.
He's a little old for you, isn't he?
No.
He's a junior.
I'm a junior.
I thought you liked the Cullens.
I thought you didn't like any of the boys in town.
Edward doesn't live in town.
Technically.
He's right outside.
He is?
Yeah, he wanted to meet you, officially.
All right.
Bring him in.
Could you be nice?
He's important.
Chief Swan.
I want to formally introduce myself. I'm Edward Cullen.
Hi, Edward.
Bella won't be out too late tonight.
She's just gonna play baseball with my family.
Baseball?
Yes, sir, that's the plan.
Bella's gonna play baseball.
Well, good luck with that.
I'll take good care of her.
I promise.
Hey.
Still got that pepper spray?
Yeah, Dad.
And since when do vampires like baseball?
Well, it's the American pastime, and there's a thunderstorm coming.
It's the only time we can play.
You'll see why.
Hey.
Glad you're here.
We need an umpire.
She thinks we cheat.
I know you cheat.
- Call them as you see them, Bella.
- Okay.
It's time.
Okay, now I see why you need the thunder.
That's gotta be a home run, right?
Edward's very fast.
Ooh, baby, don't you know I suffer?
Ooh, baby, I'm a fool for you
Come home, Rosalie!
- You're out.
- Out!
Babe, come on. It's just a game.
Nice kitty.
What are you doing?
My monkey man.
Stop!
They were leaving.
Then they heard us.
- Let's go.
- It's too late.
Get your hair down.
Like that'll help.
I can smell her from across the field.
I shouldn't have brought you here.
I'm so sorry.
- What?
What are you...
- Just be quiet and stand behind me.
I believe this belongs to you.
Thank you.
I am Laurent.
And this is Victoria and James.
I'm Carlisle.
This is my family.
Hello.
I'm afraid your hunting activities have caused something of a mess for us.
Our apologies.
We didn't realize the territory had been claimed.
Yes, well, we maintain a permanent residence nearby.
Really?
Well, we won't be a problem anymore.
We were just passing through.
The humans were tracking us, but we led them east.
You should be safe.
Excellent.
So, could you use three more players?
Come on.
Just one game.
Sure.
Why not?
A few of us were leaving.
You could take their place.
We'll bat first.
I'm the one with the wicked curveball.
Well, I think we can handle that.
We shall see.
You brought a snack.
A human?
The girl is with us.
I think it best if you leave.
I can see the game is over.
We'll go now.
James.
Get Bella out of here.
Go.
Okay, I've got it!
I've got it!
I'm all right!
What, now he's coming after me?
Listen to me.
James is a tracker. The hunt is his obsession.
I read his mind.
My reaction on the field set him off.
I just made this his most exciting game ever.
- He's never gonna stop.
- What should we do?
We have to kill him.
Rip him apart and burn the pieces.
- Where we going?
- Away from Forks.
- We'll get a ferry to Vancouver.
- I have to go home. Now.
- You have to take me home.
- You can't go home.
He's just gonna trace your scent there.
It's the first place he's gonna look.
- But my dad is there. We...
- It doesn't matter!
Yes, it does!
He could get killed because of us!
Just let me get you out of here first, all right?
It's my dad!
We have to go back!
We'll figure a way to lead the tracker away somehow.
I don't know.
But we have to do something.
- Edward, I said leave me alone.
- Bella, don't do this, please.
It's over!
Get out!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Bella? What's going on?
I just gotta get out of here.
I'm leaving now.
Hey.
Bella?
What am I gonna say to him?
I can't hurt him.
- Bella, what's going on?
- You just have to.
I'll be down at the truck.
Did he hurt you?
No.
Break up with you or something?
No, I broke up with him.
I thought you liked him.
Yeah, that's why I have to leave.
I don't want this.
I have to go home.
Home?
Your...
Your mom's not even in Phoenix.
She'll come home.
I'll call her from the road.
You're not gonna drive home right now.
You can sleep on it.
If you still feel like going in the morning,
- I'll take you to the airport.
- No.
I want to drive.
It'll give me more time to think.
I mean, if I get really tired, I'll pull into a motel.
I promise.
Look, Bella, I know I'm not that much fun to be around, but I can change that.
We can do more stuff together.
Like what?
Like watch baseball on the flat-screen?
Eat at the diner every night?
Steak and cobbler?
Dad, that's you. That's not me.
Bella, come on, I just...
I just got you back.
Yeah, and, you know, if I don't get out now, then I'm just gonna be stuck here like Mom.
Your father's gonna forgive you.
Why don't you let me drive?
He won't.
You should've seen his face.
I told him the same thing that my mom told him when she was leaving him.
It's the only way he'd let you go.
Just don't worry about him now.
He's safe.
The tracker's following us.
- Oh, God.
- It's just Emmett.
Alice is in the car behind us.
Wait.
He came to warn us about James.
This isn't my fight, and I've grown tired of his games, but he's got unparalleled senses, absolutely lethal.
I've never seen anything like him in my 300 years.
And the woman, Victoria, don't underestimate her.
I've had to fight our kind before.
- They're not easy to kill.
- But not impossible.
We'll tear them apart and burn the pieces.
I don't relish the thought of killing another creature, even a sadistic one like James.
- What if he kills one of us first?
- I'm gonna run Bella south.
Can you lead the tracker away from here?
No, Edward.
James knows you would never leave Bella.
- He'll follow you.
- I'll go with Bella.
Jasper and I will drive her south.
I'll keep her safe, Edward.
- Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
- Yes.
Rosalie, Esme, could you put these on so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent?
Why?
What is she to me?
Rosalie, Bella is with Edward.
She's part of this family now, and we protect our family.
Oh, God.
If anything...
What if...
If anything happens, I swear to God...
Nothing's gonna happen.
There's seven of us, and there's two of them, and when everything's done, I'm gonna come back and get you.
Bella, you are my life now.
Hey, Mom. It's me again.
You must have let your phone die or something.
I'm not in Forks, but everything's okay, and I'll explain it later.
Rosalie, mark the tree.
That's good.
What is it?
What do you see?
He's figured it out.
The tracker, he just changed course.
- Where will it take him, Alice? - Mirrors.
A room full of mirrors.
Edward said the visions weren't always certain.
She sees the course people are on while they're on it.
If they change their minds, the vision changes.
Okay, so the course that the tracker's on now is gonna lead him to a ballet studio?
- You've been here?
- I took lessons as a kid.
The school I went to had an arch just like that.
Was your school here in Phoenix?
- Edward, are you okay?
- We've lost the tracker.
The woman's still in the area.
Rosalie and Esme are going back to Forks to protect your father.
I'm coming to get you.
Then you and I are gonna go somewhere alone.
And the others will keep hunting.
I'll do whatever it takes to make you safe again.
Hey, Mom, I'm glad you got my message.
What are you doing home?
Bella?
Bella?
Bella, where are you?
Calm down, everything's fine.
I'll explain everything later.
Mom, are you there?
Forks High School doesn't protect its students' privacy very well.
It was just too easy for Victoria to find your previous address.
It's a nice house you have here.
I was prepared to wait for you, but then Mom came home after she received a very worried call from your dad, and it all worked out quite well.
Wait, wait...
Don't touch her! Don't...
You can still save her.
But you're gonna have to get away from your friends.
- Can you handle that?
- Where should I meet you?
How about your old ballet studio?
And I'll know if you bring anyone along.
Poor Mommy would pay the price for that mistake.
I'd never given much thought to how I would die.
But dying in the place of someone I love seems like a good way to go.
I can't bring myself to regret the decisions that brought me face-to-face with death.
They also brought me to Edward.
Bella? Bella?
Bella, where are you?
- Mom?
- Bella?
- Mom?
- There you are.
What are you doing in here?
Everyone makes fun of me.
Come on, you're a wonderful dancer.
Mom, I suck.
You do not suck.
That's my favorite part.
You were a stubborn child, weren't you?
- She's not even here.
- No.
Sorry.
You know, but you really made it too easy.
So to make things more entertaining,
I'm gonna make a little film of our time together.
I borrowed this from your house.
I hope you don't mind.
Good.
And action.
That'll break Edward's little heart.
You have...
Edward has nothing to do with this!
But he does.
His rage will make for more interesting sport than his feeble attempt to protect you.
And let's continue.
Beautiful.
Very visually dynamic.
I chose my stage well.
It's too bad he didn't have the strength to turn you.
Instead, he kept you this fragile little human.
It's cruel, really.
Tell Edward how much it hurts.
Tell him to avenge you.
Tell him!
- No, Edward, don't!
- Tell him!
Tell him!
You're alone 'cause you're faster than the others.
But not stronger.
I'm strong enough to kill you.
I'm sorry.
Bella, Bella, it's okay.
Son. Enough.
Remember who you are.
Bella, you're okay.
Bella needs you.
It's okay.
Oh, God.
Carlisle?
Her blood.
- Your brothers will take care of him.
- I got him.
- Carlisle!
- Start the fire.
Get the floorboards.
- Alice!
- Alice, go.
Her femoral artery's been severed.
She's losing too much blood.
No, no, my head is burning!
It's the venom.
You have to make a choice.
You could let the change happen.
No.
No.
- It's gonna happen, Edward.
I've seen it.
- It doesn't have to be that way.
She's still hemorrhaging.
Alice, make me a tourniquet.
Your belt.
Carlisle, what's my other option?
Tie it above my hands.
Carlisle!
Go.
- We could try to suck the venom out.
- You know I won't be able to stop.
Then find the will to stop.
But choose.
She only has minutes left.
I'm gonna make it go away, Bella.
I'm gonna make it go away.
Edward, stop.
Her blood is clean.
You're killing her.
Edward.
Stop.
Stop.
Find the will.
Death is peaceful, easy.
Life is harder.
Bella?
Baby?
Bella.
- Mom?
- Hey.
Where is he?
Where's...
Where's Edward?
He's asleep.
He never leaves.
And your dad, he's down at the cafeteria.
What happened?
Well, when you fell, you broke your leg, and you lost a lot of blood.
You don't remember any of this, do you?
Edward came down with his dad to try to convince you to come back to Forks.
So you went over to their hotel, then you tripped, and you fell down two flights of stairs.
Went through a window.
Yeah, that sounds like me.
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
It's Phil.
He's so worried about you.
You're texting.
Finally, yeah.
I told him to stay down in Florida.
Honey, you are gonna love Jacksonville.
It's sunny every day, and we found the cutest little house, and you've got your own bathroom.
Mom, I still want to live in Forks.
What?
I want to live in Forks.
Well, okay, but we'll talk about it.
Do you mind getting Dad?
I have to talk to him.
Apologize.
Okay, baby.
I'll go get him.
- And I'll go get a nurse, okay?
- Okay.
So what happened?
Where's James?
We took care of it.
And the woman, Victoria, she ran off.
I'm alive because of you.
No, you're in here because of me.
The worst part of it was that
I thought I wasn't gonna be able to stop.
You did stop.
Bella, you gotta go to Jacksonville so I can't hurt you anymore.
What?
Are you...
No!
No!
I don't even know what you're...
How...
What are you talking about?
You want me to go away?
I can't...
No, I can't...
I can't just leave you...
I know.
We can't be apart.
You can't leave me.
I'm here.
Okay, just don't...
You just can't say stuff like that to me.
Ever.
Where else am I gonna go?
Alice lent me the dress.
The cast is...
You're perfect.
I'll take care of her, Chief Swan.
I've heard that before.
All right, Bells.
I put a new can of pepper spray in your bag.
Dad.
And...
Well, you look beautiful.
Thanks.
See you.
Hey. I'll be right back.
- Bella.
- Jacob.
Hey.
- Nice.
- You, too.
Are you crashing the prom or something?
Did you come with a date?
No.
My dad paid me to come talk to you.
Twenty bucks.
Let's hear it.
Just don't get mad, okay?
He wants you to break up with your boyfriend.
It's just, he said, quote,
"We'll be watching you."
- Okay, well, tell him, "Thanks."
- Okay.
- And to pay up. - Okay.
Let me help you.
Jacob.
I'll take it from here.
Guess I'll see you around, Bella.
All right.
I leave you alone for two minutes, and the wolves descend.
- I can't believe you're making me do this.
- Just smile.
You are really trying to kill me.
The prom is an important rite of passage.
I didn't want you to miss anything.
Bella, hey!
Do you want to go?
All right, slowing it down.
Shall we?
You're serious?
Why not.
See, you're dancing.
At prom.
Edward, why did you save me?
If you just let the venom spread,
I could be like you by now.
You don't know what you're saying.
- You don't want this.
- I want you.
Always.
I'm not gonna end your life for you.
I'm dying already.
Every second, I get closer.
Older.
That's the way it's supposed to be.
Alice said that she saw me like you.
- I heard her.
- Her visions change.
Yeah, based on what people decide.
I've decided.
So that's what you dream about.
Becoming a monster.
I dream about being with you forever.
Forever?
And you're ready right now?
Yes.
Is it not enough just to have a long and happy life with me?
For now.
No one will surrender tonight, but I won't give in.
I know what I want.
Towels.
Lord Miraz?
You have a son.
The heavens have blessed us.
You know your orders.
General Glozelle?
Yes, my lord.
Five more minutes.
Won't be watching the stars tonight, my prince.
Come. - Your aunt has given birth to a son.
- Professor, what's going on?
Come.
You must make for the woods.
- The woods?
- They won't follow you there.
It has taken me many years to find this.
Do not use it except at your greatest need.
Will I ever see you again?
I dearly hope so, my prince.
There is so much more I meant to tell you.
Everything you know is about to change.
Close the drawbridge!
Now, go.
- Halt!
- Halt!
A son!
A son!
Lady Prunaprismia has this night given Lord Miraz a son!
Which of you superstitious old women wants to spend the night in a cell?
He's seen us.
Take care of him.
No!
- Mind yourself, love.
- I'm sorry.
Watch where you're going!
Wait for me!
You go to Saint Finbar's?
That's right.
I go to Hendon House. Across the road.
I've seen you sitting by yourself.
Yes, well, I prefer to be left alone.
Me, too.
What's your name?
- Phyllis.
- Susan!
You'd better come quickly.
Paper here!
Get your daily paper!
Edmund!
Go on!
Kick him in the face!
Stop it.
Break it up.
That's enough. Come on.
That's it. Get up.
Act your age!
- You're welcome.
- I had it sorted.
What was it this time?
- He bumped me.
- So you hit him?
No. After he bumped me, they tried to make me apologize.
- That's when I hit him.
- Really?
- Is it that hard just to walk away?
- I shouldn't have to.
I mean, don't you ever get tired of being treated like a kid?
We are kids.
Well, I wasn't always.
It's been a year.
How long does he expect us to wait?
I think it's time to accept that we live here.
It's no use pretending any different.
Oh, no.
- Pretend you're talking to me.
- We are talking to you.
- Quiet, Lu.
- Something pinched me!
- Stop pulling!
- Not touching you.
Look, would all of you just... What is that?
- It feels like magic.
- Everyone hold hands.
- I'm not holding your hand!
- Just...
Shame you're not as quick as me, Ed!
Last one in's a rotten egg.
Watch out!
Here it comes!
Wait a minute!
Come on, Susan.
Hurry up!
Come on, it's lovely.
Edmund.
Ed?
Ed!
- What is it?
- Where do you suppose we are?
Well, where do you think?
Well, I don't remember any ruins in Narnia.
Wonder who lived here.
I think we did.
Hey, that's mine.
- From my chess set.
- Which chess set?
I didn't exactly have a solid gold chess set in Finchley, did I?
Can't be.
- Don't you see?
- What?
Imagine walls.
And columns, there.
And a glass roof.
Cair Paravel.
Wait. Wait, my lord. It is not what you think.
Then what is it?
We're not exactly sure.
Impossible.
I warned this council when it put its trust in Lord Miraz there would be consequences.
We can't accuse the Lord Protector without proof.
How long are we going to hide behind that excuse?
Until every chair in this chamber is empty?
Lords of the council, my apologies for being late.
I wasn't aware we were in session.
No doubt you were otherwise occupied.
My lord?
Ever since the death of Caspian the ninth, you've behaved as if you were king.
Now it seems that from behind his walls even Prince Caspian has gone missing.
My deepest condolences, Lord Miraz.
Imagine, losing your nephew, the rightful heir to the throne, on the very night your wife has blessed you with a son.
Thank you, Lord Sopespian.
Your compassion is a boon in this troubled time.
I trust you can tell us how such a tragedy could have occurred.
That is the most disturbing news of all.
Our beloved Caspian was abducted by Narnians.
You go too far, Miraz.
Expect us to stand by while you blame such a blatant crime on fairy tales?
What?
We forget, my lords, Narnia was once a savage land.
Fierce creatures roamed free.
Much of our forefathers' blood was shed to exterminate this vermin.
Or so we thought.
But while we've been bickering amongst ourselves they've been breeding like cockroaches under a rock!
Growing stronger.
Watching us.
Waiting to strike!
And you wonder why we don't like you.
Well, I intend to strike back.
Even if I have to cut down the entire forest,
I assure you, I will find Prince Caspian and finish what our ancestors began.
- Catapults.
- What?
This didn't just happen.
Cair Paravel was attacked.
Don't suppose you have any matches, do you?
No, but would this help?
You might have mentioned that a bit sooner.
I can't believe it. It's all still here.
I was so tall.
Well, you were older then.
As opposed to hundreds of years later... when you're younger.
- What is it?
- My horn.
I must've left it on my saddle the day we went back.
When Aslan bares his teeth, winter meets its death.
When he shakes his mane we shall have spring again.
Mr. Tumnus and the Beavers they're all gone.
I think it's time we found out what's going on.
He won't stop staring.
So don't look.
Here's far enough.
Drop him!
Crows and crockery!
"Drop him"!
That's the best you can come up with?
A simple "thank you" would suffice.
They were doing fine drowning me without your help.
Maybe we should have let them.
Why were they trying to kill you, anyway?
They're Telmarines. That's what they do.
Telmarines?
In Narnia?
Where have you been for the last few hundred years?
It's a bit of a long story.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
You're it?
You're the kings and queens of old?
High King Peter, the Magnificent.
You probably could've left off the last bit.
Probably.
You might be surprised.
You don't want to do that, boy.
Not me.
Him.
Edmund!
You all right?
Beards and bedsteads!
Maybe that horn worked after all.
What horn?
This bread is so stale.
I'll just get him some soup.
He should be coming around soon.
I don't think I hit him hard enough.
Nikabrik, he's just a boy.
He's a Telmarine, not some lost puppy.
You said you were gonna get rid of him.
No.
I said I'd take care of him.
We can't kill him now.
I just bandaged his head.
It would be like murdering a guest.
How do you think his friends are treating their guest?
Trumpkin knew what he was doing. It's not the boy's fault.
Stop!
Stop!
Hold it.
No, no!
I told you we should have killed him when we had the chance.
- You know why we can't.
- If we're taking a vote, I'm with him.
We can't let him go. He's seen us.
That's enough, Nikabrik!
Or do I have to sit on your head again?
And you. Look what you made me do.
I spent half the morning on that soup.
What are you?
You know, it's funny that you would ask that.
You think people would know a badger when they saw one.
No.
You're supposed to be extinct.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Here you go. Still hot.
Since when did we open a boarding house for Telmarine soldiers?
I'm not a soldier.
I am Prince Caspian. The tenth.
What are you doing here?
Running away.
My uncle has always wanted my throne.
I suppose I have only lived this long because he did not have an heir of his own.
- Well, that changes things.
- Yeah.
Means we don't have to kill you ourselves.
You're right.
- Where are you going?
- My uncle won't stop until I am dead.
But you can't leave.
You're meant to save us.
Don't you know what this is?
You have quite a library, doctor.
Is there anything particular you seek, my lord?
I think I've already found what I'm looking for in one of my soldiers!
What do you know of Queen Susan's horn?
It was said to be magic.
Magic?
The Narnians believed it could summon their kings and queens of old.
At least, such was the superstition.
And what does Caspian know of this superstition?
My lord, you forbade me from mentioning the old tales.
So I did.
I will say this. If Caspian does know of the Deep Magic, my lord would have good reason to be nervous.
First our prince now his tutor.
If the members of Miraz's own house are not safe,
- are any of us?
- Lord Sopespian!
Those are dangerous words, Lord Sopespian.
But these are dangerous times, general.
One should choose his words as carefully as he chooses his friends.
How long until the bridge is finished?
- Construction continues on schedule.
- That's not good enough.
I need my army across that river now.
May I suggest you contribute some of your own men?
I've only so many at my disposal.
A fact you'd be wise to remember.
Go to Beruna.
Take as many troops as you need. We must get to Caspian before they do.
"They," my lord?
It's time you learned your history.
They're so still.
They're trees.
What'd you expect?
They used to dance.
Wasn't long after you left that the Telmarines invaded.
Those who survived retreated to the woods.
And the trees, they retreated so deep into themselves that they haven't been heard from since.
I don't understand. How could Aslan have let this happen?
Aslan?
Thought he abandoned us when you lot did.
We didn't mean to leave, you know.
Makes no difference now, does it?
Get us to the Narnians and it will.
Hello, there.
It's all right. We're friends.
Don't move, Your Majesty.
Stay away from her!
Shoot, Susan!
Shoot!
- Why wouldn't he stop?
- I suspect he was hungry.
Thanks.
He was wild.
I don't think he could talk at all.
Get treated like a dumb animal long enough, that's what you become.
You may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember.
I can hear you.
I just think we should wait for the kings and queens.
Fine! Go then!
See if the others will be as understanding!
Or maybe I'll come with you.
I want to see you explain things to the minotaurs.
Minotaurs?
They're real?
And very bad-tempered.
- Yeah, not to mention big.
- Huge.
What about centaurs?
Do they still exist?
Well, the centaurs will probably fight on your side.
But there's no telling what the others will do.
What about Aslan?
How do you know so much about us?
- Stories.
- Wait a minute.
Your father told you stories about Narnia?
No, my professor, he...
Listen, I'm sorry.
These are not the kind of questions you should be asking.
- What is it?
- Human.
- Him?
- No. Them.
- There they are!
- Run!
Now!
- Oh, no.
- Wait. I'll go.
Take it. Go!
It's more important than I am.
Get him out of here.
Where are you?
Choose your last words carefully, Telmarine.
You are a mouse.
I was hoping for something a little more original.
Pick up your sword.
No, thanks.
Pick it up! I will not fight an unarmed man.
Which is why I might live longer if I choose not to cross blades with you, noble mouse.
I said I would not fight you.
I didn't say I'd let you live!
Reepicheep!
- Stay your blade!
- Trufflehunter?
I trust you have a very good reason for this untimely interruption.
- He doesn't. Go ahead.
- He's the one who blew the horn.
- What?
- Then let him bring it forward.
This is the reason we have gathered.
I don't remember this way.
That's the problem with girls. You can't carry a map in your heads.
That's because our heads have something in them.
I wish he'd just listen to the D.L.F. in the first place.
- D.L. F?
- Dear Little Friend.
Oh, that's not at all patronizing, is it?
I'm not lost.
No.
You're just going the wrong way.
You last saw Caspian at the Shuddering Woods, and the quickest way there is to cross at the river Rush.
But unless I'm mistaken, there's no crossing in these parts.
That explains it, then. You're mistaken.
You see, over time, water erodes the earth's soil, carving deeper...
Oh, shut up.
- Is there a way down?
- Yeah, falling.
Well, we weren't lost.
There's a ford near Beruna. How do you feel about swimming?
I'd rather that than walking.
He's right there.
It's Aslan!
It's Aslan over there!
Don't you see?
Do you see him now?
I'm not crazy.
He was there. He wanted us to follow him.
I'm sure there are any number of lions in this wood.
- Just like that bear.
- I think I know Aslan when I see him.
Look, I'm not about to jump off a cliff after someone who doesn't exist.
The last time I didn't believe Lucy
I ended up looking pretty stupid.
Why wouldn't I have seen him?
Maybe you weren't looking.
I'm sorry, Lu.
Kill him!
- Telmarine!
- Liar!
Murderer!
All this horn proves is they've stolen yet another thing from us!
- I didn't steal anything.
- Didn't steal anything?
Shall we list the things the Telmarines have taken?
- Our homes!
- Our land!
- Our freedom!
- Our lives!
You stole Narnia!
You would hold me accountable for all the crimes of my people?
Accountable and punishable.
That is rich coming from you, dwarf.
Have you forgotten it was your people who fought alongside the White Witch?
And I'd gladly do it again, if it would rid us of these barbarians.
Then it's lucky that it is not in your power to bring her back.
Or are you suggesting that we ask this boy to go against Aslan now?
Some of you may have forgotten, but we badgers remember well, that Narnia was never right except when a Son of Adam was king.
He's a Telmarine!
Why would we want him as our king?
Because I can help you.
- It's a trick!
- At least hear him out!
Beyond these woods, I'm a prince.
The Telmarine throne is rightfully mine!
Help me claim it, and I can bring peace between us.
It is true.
The time is ripe.
I watch the skies, for it is mine to watch as it is yours to remember, badger.
Tarva, the lord of victory, and Alambil, the lady of peace, have come together in the high heavens.
And now here, a Son of Adam has come forth to offer us back our freedom.
Is this possible?
Do you really think there could be peace?
Do you? I mean, really?
Two days ago, I didn't believe in the existence of talking animals or dwarves... or centaurs.
Yet here you are in strength and numbers that we Telmarines could never have imagined.
Whether this horn is magic or not, it brought us together.
And together, we have a chance to take back what is ours.
If you will lead us, then my sons and I offer you our swords.
And we offer you our lives, unreservedly.
Miraz's army will not be far behind us, sire.
If we are to be ready for them, we need to hurry to find soldiers and weapons.
I'm sure they will be here soon. These ones! And these ones!
So where exactly do you think you saw Aslan?
I wish you'd all stop trying to sound like grown-ups.
I don't think I saw him, I did see him.
I am a grown-up.
It was right over...
Lucy!
...here.
Lucy, are you awake?
Why do you think I didn't see Aslan?
You believe me?
Well, we got across the gorge.
I don't know.
Maybe you didn't really want to.
You always knew we'd be coming back here, didn't you?
I hoped so.
I finally just got used to the idea of being in England.
But you're happy to be here, aren't you?
While it lasts.
Lucy.
Lucy.
Aslan!
I've missed you so much!
- Every year you grow so shall I.
Where have you been?
Why haven't you come to help us?
Things never happen the same way twice, dear one.
Susan!
Wake up!
Certainly, Lu. Whatever you like.
Wake up.
Aslan?
No, stop!
Prince Caspian?
Yes?
And who are you?
Peter!
- High King Peter.
- I believe you called.
Well, yes, but...
I thought you'd be older.
If you like, we could come back in a few years...
No. No, that's all right.
You're just...
You're not exactly what I expected.
Neither are you.
A common enemy unites even the oldest of foes.
We have anxiously awaited your return, my liege.
Our hearts and swords are at your service.
Oh, my gosh, he is so cute.
- Who said that?
- Sorry.
Your Majesty, with the greatest respect,
I do believe "courageous," "courteous," or "chivalrous"
might more befit a knight of Narnia.
Well, at least we know some of you can handle a blade.
Yes, indeed. And I have recently put it to good use, securing weapons for your army, sire.
Good. Because we're going to need every sword we can get.
Well, then, you will probably be wanting yours back.
How much did they take?
Enough weapons and armor for two regiments.
But... there's more.
"You were right to fear the woods."
- "X"?
- Caspian. The tenth.
I apologize, my lord.
The blame is mine.
I know.
Tell me, general how many men did you lose?
- None, my lord.
- None?
They came like ghosts, in the dead of night.
We never saw them.
Then how do you explain your injuries?
I asked how many men were killed during this bloody Narnian attack?
Of which you were a fortunate survivor.
General how many?
Three.
I apologize, Lord Sopespian.
Caspian is not a victim of this savage uprising.
He is the instigator.
It seems Narnia is in need of a new king.
Well, it's good you have troops, but we need some fortifications.
So?
What are they like?
Malcontents, complainers, stubborn as mules in the morning.
So you like them, then.
Well enough.
It may not be what you are used to, but it is defensible.
Peter.
You may want to see this.
It's us.
What is this place?
You don't know?
He must know what he's doing.
I think it's up to us now.
It's only a matter of time.
Miraz's men and war machines are on their way.
That means those same men aren't protecting his castle.
What do you propose we do, Your Majesty?
- We need to get ready for it.
- To start planning for...
Our only hope is to strike them before they strike us.
Crazy. No one has taken that castle.
- There's always a first time.
- We'll have the element of surprise.
- But we have the advantage here!
- If we dig in, we could probably hold them off indefinitely.
I, for one, feel safer underground.
Look. I appreciate what you've done here, but this isn't a fortress.
It's a tomb.
Yes.
And if they're smart, the Telmarines will just wait and starve us out.
- We could collect nuts!
- Yes! And throw them at the Telmarines.
Shut up!
I think you know where I stand, sire.
If I get your troops in, can you handle the guards?
Or die trying, my liege.
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Sorry?
You're all acting like there's only two options.
Dying here, or dying there.
- I'm not sure you've been listening.
- No, you're not listening.
Or have you forgotten who really defeated the White Witch, Peter?
I think we've waited for Aslan long enough.
Professor?
- I have to find him.
- You don't have time.
- You need to get the gate open.
- You wouldn't be here without him.
And neither would I.
You and I can deal with Miraz.
And I can still get to the gate in time.
Yes, I'm a mouse.
We were expecting someone, you know, taller.
- You're one to talk.
- Is that supposed to be irony?
Five more minutes?
What are you doing here?
I didn't help you escape just so you could break back in.
You have to get out before Miraz learns you're here.
He's going to learn soon enough.
We are giving him your cell.
Don't underestimate Miraz as your father did.
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry.
Thank goodness you're safe.
Get up.
- Caspian?
- Stay where you are.
- What are you doing?
- I should think it's obvious, dear.
You know, some families might consider this inappropriate behavior.
That doesn't seem to have stopped you!
But you are not like me, are you?
It's sad. The first time you've shown any backbone and it's such a waste.
Put the sword down, Caspian.
- I don't want to do this.
- We don't want you to either.
This used to be a private room.
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be in the gatehouse!
No!
Tonight for once, I want the truth.
Did you kill my father?
Now we get to it.
You said your brother died in his sleep.
That was more or less true.
Caspian, this won't make things any better.
We Telmarines would have nothing had we not taken it.
Your father knew that as well as anyone.
How could you?
For the same reason you will pull that trigger.
- For our son.
- Stop!
- Stay right there.
- You need to make a choice, dear.
Do you want our child to be king?
Or do you want him to be like Caspian here?
- Fatherless!
- No!
Caspian!
What's that supposed to mean?
- We're under attack!
- Sound the alarm!
Men!
Grab your bows!
- Peter!
- Our troops are just outside!
Come on!
Now, Ed!
Now!
- Signal the troops!
- I'm a bit busy, Pete!
Peter! It's too late.
We have to call it off while we can.
No, I can still do this!
Help me!
Exactly who are you doing this for, Peter?
Come on!
Charge!
We're under attack!
Attack! Attack!
For Narnia!
Archers!
Pick a target!
Take aim!
Ed!
Get that gate closed.
Fall back!
We need to retreat!
Now!
Go! Get her out of here!
Back to the gate!
Go!
- Caspian!
- I'll find him!
Go!
Get out!
Go!
Get out!
Retreat!
Follow me!
Give the order.
My men are still down there.
Draw back!
Get out!
Retreat!
Now!
Fire!
Run for your life!
Save yourself!
Peter!
The bridge!
Leave us!
Go, brothers!
In the name of Aslan!
What happened?
Ask him.
- Peter.
- Me?
You could've called it off. There was still time.
No, there wasn't, thanks to you.
If you kept to the plan, those soldiers might be alive.
If you'd stayed here like I suggested, they definitely would be!
- You called us, remember?
- My first mistake.
No. Your first mistake was thinking you could lead these people.
I am not the one who abandoned Narnia.
You invaded Narnia. You have no more right to lead it than Miraz does.
You, him, your father...
Narnia's better off without the lot of you.
Stop it!
What are you all standing around for?
Telmarines will be here soon enough.
Thank you...
Galma pledges its troops.
Tashbaan pledges its troops.
Ettinsmoor pledges its troops.
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Are you so glad of that magic horn now, boy?
Your kings and queens have failed us.
Your army's half dead. And those that aren't will be soon enough.
What do you want?
Congratulations?
You want your uncle's blood. So do we.
You want his throne?
We can get it for you.
You tried one ancient power. It failed.
But there is a power greater still.
One that kept even Aslan at bay for near a hundred years.
Who's there?
I am hunger.
I am thirst.
I can fast a hundred years and not die.
I can lie a hundred nights on the ice and not freeze.
I can drink a river of blood and not burst.
Show me... your enemies!
What you hate, so will we.
No one hates better than us.
And you can...
guarantee Miraz's death?
And more.
Let the circle be drawn.
Wait.
This isn't what I wanted.
One drop of Adam's blood and you free me.
Then I am yours, my king.
No!
Stop!
Come on!
Come.
Get away from him!
Peter, dear.
I've missed you.
Come.
Just one drop.
You know you can't do this alone.
I know. You had it sorted.
Why did you never tell me about my father?
My mother was a Black Dwarf from the Northern Mountains.
I risked my life all these years so that one day you might be a better king than those before you.
Then I have failed you.
Everything I told you, everything I didn't, it was only because I believe in you.
You have a chance to become the most noble contradiction in history.
The Telmarine who saved Narnia.
You're lucky, you know.
What do you mean?
To have seen him.
I wish he'd just given me some sort of proof.
Maybe we're the ones who need to prove ourselves to him.
Pete. You'd better come quickly.
Cakes and kettledrums. That's your next big plan?
Sending a little girl into the darkest parts of the forest? Alone!
- It's our only chance.
- And she won't be alone.
Haven't enough of us died already?
Nikabrik was my friend too. But he lost hope.
Queen Lucy hasn't. And neither have I.
For Aslan.
For Aslan!
- Then I'm going with you.
- No. We need you here.
We have to hold them off until Lucy and Susan get back.
If I may...
Miraz may be a tyrant and a murderer but as king, he is subject to the traditions and expectations of his people.
There is one in particular that may buy us some time.
Perhaps they intend to surrender.
No.
They are much too noble for that.
"I, Peter, by the gift of Aslan, by election and by conquest,
High King of Narnia, Lord of Cair Paravel and emperor of the Lone Islands, in order to prevent the abominable effusion of blood, do hereby challenge the usurper Miraz to single combat upon the field of battle.
The fight shall be to the death. The reward shall be total surrender."
- Tell me, Prince Edmund...
- King.
- Pardon me?
- It's King Edmund, actually.
Just "King," though. Peter's the high king.
I know, it's confusing.
Why would we risk such a proposal when our armies could wipe you out by nightfall?
Haven't you already underestimated our numbers?
I mean, only a week ago Narnians were extinct.
And so you will be again.
Well, then you should have little to fear.
This is not a question of bravery.
So you're bravely refusing to fight a swordsman half your age?
I didn't say I refused.
You shall have our support, Your Majesty.
Whatever your decision.
Sire, our military advantage alone provides the perfect excuse to avoid
- what might otherwise be...
- I'm not avoiding anything!
I was merely pointing out that my lord is well within his rights to refuse.
His Majesty would never refuse.
He relishes the chance to show the people the courage of their new king.
You.
You should hope your brother's sword is sharper than his pen.
Destrier has always served me well. You are in good hands.
Or hooves.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Look.
Maybe it is time you had this back.
Why don't you hold on to it. You might need to call me again.
- You might need to call me again?
- Oh, shut up.
If it should appear to be going poorly...
Understood, Your Majesty.
I hope you won't be too disappointed when I survive.
There is still time to surrender.
Well, feel free.
How many more must die for the throne?
Just one.
- Ride!
- They've seen us!
- Take the reins.
- What are you doing?
I'm sorry, Lucy. But it looks as if you'll be going alone after all.
Are you sure you don't need that horn?
Does His Highness need a respite?
Five minutes?
Three!
Lucy?
She got through... with a little help.
- Thanks.
- Well, you were busy.
I assume you won't let things get that close again!
You better get up there.
Just in case.
I don't expect the Telmarines will keep their word.
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
Be careful.
Keep smiling.
How does he look to you?
Young.
But His Majesty's doing extremely well... for his age.
I think it's dislocated.
What do you think happens back home if you die here?
You know you've always been there, and I never really...
Save it for later.
Respite!
Respite.
Now's not the time for chivalry, Peter!
Show no mercy!
Look out!
What's the matter, boy?
Too cowardly to take a life?
It's not mine to take.
Perhaps I was wrong.
Maybe you do have the makings of a Telmarine king after all.
Not one like you.
Keep your life.
But I am giving the Narnians back their kingdom.
My king.
I'll deal with you when this is over.
It is over.
Treachery!
They shot him!
They murdered our king!
Be ready!
Peter!
Go!
To arms, Telmar!
To arms!
Loose!
Cavalry!
Attack!
Archers to the ready!
Narnians!
Charge!
One, two...
Three, four...
Five, six...
Take your aim!
Stay with them!
Eight, nine...
Get ready!
Now!
Stop! Back! Back!
Charge!
Charge!
You're a mouse.
You people have no imagination. Loose! Loose!
Back to the How!
Cut off their escape! Loose! Loose!
Back to the How!
Crush them all.
Aslan!
I knew it was you.
The whole time, I knew it.
But the others didn't believe me.
And why would that stop you from coming to me?
I'm sorry. I was too scared to come alone.
Why wouldn't you show yourself?
Why couldn't you come roaring in and save us like last time?
Things never happen the same way twice, dear one.
If I'd have come earlier, would everyone who died... could I have stopped that?
We can never know what would have happened, Lucy.
But what will happen is another matter entirely.
- You mean you'll help?
- Of course.
- As will you.
- Oh, I wish I was braver.
If you were any braver, you'd be a lioness.
Now, I think your friends have slept long enough, don't you?
Come on!
Lucy.
For Aslan!
We can defeat them if we draw them to the river.
We must regroup. To Beruna!
To the bridge!
Charge!
What is happening?
- The river!
- Retreat!
Back!
You will not be harmed!
Surrender your weapons!
Take off the armor!
Rise, kings and queens of Narnia.
All of you.
I do not think I am ready.
It's for that very reason I know you are.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Thank you.
Hail, Aslan!
It is a great honor to be in...
I'm completely out of countenance.
I must crave your indulgence for appearing in this unseemly fashion.
Perhaps a drop more?
- I don't think it does that.
- You could have a go.
It becomes you well, small one.
All the same, great king,
I regret that I must withdraw, for a tail is the honor and glory of a mouse.
Perhaps you think too much of your honor, friend.
Well, it's not just the honor. It's also great for balance.
And climbing. And grabbing things.
May it please Your High Majesty, we will not bear the shame of wearing an honor denied to our chief.
Not for the sake of your dignity, but for the love of your people.
Look! Thank you, my liege. I will treasure it always.
From this day forward it will serve as a great reminder of my huge humility.
Now, where is this dear little friend you've told me so much about?
Do you see him now?
Because you have snuck in...
I'm sorry, but their future in that world shall be good.
Your Majesty?
We are ready. Everyone has assembled.
Narnia belongs to the Narnians, just as it does to man.
Any Telmarines who want to stay and live in peace are welcome to.
But for any of you who wish,
Aslan will return you to the home of our forefathers.
It's been generations since we left Telmar.
We're not referring to Telmar.
Your ancestors were seafaring brigands.
Pirates run aground on an island.
There they found a cave, a rare chasm that brought them here from their world.
The same world as our kings and queens.
It is to that island I can return you.
It is a good place for any who wish to make a new start.
I will go.
I will accept the offer.
So will we.
Because you have spoken first, your future in that world shall be good.
- Where did they go?
- They killed them.
How do we know he is not leading us to our death?
Sire. If my example can be of any service,
I will take 11 mice through with no delay.
- We'll go.
- We will?
Come on. Our time's up.
After all we're not really needed here anymore.
I will look after it until you return.
I'm afraid that's just it.
We're not coming back.
We're not?
You two are.
At least, I think he means you two.
But why?
- Did they do something wrong?
- Quite the opposite, dear one.
But all things have their time.
Your brother and sister have learned what they can from this world.
Now it's time for them to live in their own.
It's all right, Lu.
It's not how I thought it would be but it's all right.
One day you'll see, too.
Come on.
I'm glad I came back.
I wish we had more time together.
It would never have worked, anyway.
Why not?
I am 1,300 years older than you.
I'm sure when I'm older I'll understand.
I'm older and don't think I want to understand.
Aren't you coming, Phyllis?
You don't think there's any way we can get back?
I've left my new torch in Narnia.
NARRATOR:
Have you ever wondered how nature gets its glow?
Who gives it light and color as the seasons come and go?
Who helps all creatures, great and small, to walk, to swim, to fly?
Who crafts such tiny details?
You might see them if you try.
For it's all the work of fairies, but they stay well out of sight.
(COOING)
(LAUGHING)
And the first time that a baby laughs, a fairy's life takes flight.
(SINGING) When the moon comes out
To shine her face
The birds are fast asleep
And the lanterns hang from every post The fairies leave their keep
They join their hands and sing their songs
That nary a soul can hear
In the springtime when the earth is new
(RINGS)
To the fairies they draw near
To the fairies they draw near
(BAB Y LAUGHING)
(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
FAIRY 1:
Hello.
FAIRY 2:
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hello?
Queen Clarion.
Born of laughter, clothed in cheer, happiness has brought you here.
Welcome to Pixie Hollow.
I trust you found your way all right.
I think so.
(QUEEN CLARION LAUGHS)
Now, let's see about those wings.
(ALL GASPING)
(FAIRIES GIGGLING)
(LAUGHS)
(SIGHS)
(GASPS)
What are these things?
They will help you find your talent, little one.
But how will I know which one is...
You'll know.
(GASPS)
(SIGHS)
Hmm.
(GASPS)
(ALL CHEERING)
SILVERMIST:
Whoa!
Never seen one glow that much before, even for Vidia.
ROSETTA:
You know, I do believe you're right.
Little daisy top might be a very rare talent indeed.
(SCOFFS)
(CHUCKLES)
Come forward, tinker fairies, and welcome the newest member of your talent guild, Tinker Bell.
BOBBLE:
Glad we had a bath today, eh, Clank?
CLANK:
Excuse us! BOBBLE:
Coming through!
CLANK:
Sorry!
Make way for tinkers!
Hady-hi, hady-ho, Miss Bell.
I'm Clank.
Splinters, Clank.
Say it, don't spray it.
Phineas T. Kettletree, Esquire, at your service.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Oh, foo!
He's Bobble, I'm Clank.
(SIGHS)
Clank, Bobble.
We're pleased as a pile of perfectly polished pots you're here.
Uh...
Me, too.
(CHUCKLES)
Come on, Miss Bell.
There's so much to show you.
You've arrived at a most wondrous and glorious time.
Really?
Why?
BOBBLE:
Why, it's almost time for the changing of the seasons.
You see, here in Pixie Hollow, there are different realms for every time of year.
Well, there's one up ahead.
(TINKER BELL SHIVERS)
(CLANK SHIVERS)
Winter Woods.
It's always cold here.
Look there!
Snowflake and frost fairies returning home for...
For some well-deserved rest.
BOBBLE:
Aye.
They've just finished bringing winter to the world.
It's the off-season for the autumn fairies, too.
CLANK:
Always practicing that perfect shade of amber, eh?
BOBBLE:
And the fairies of Summer Glade still have plenty of time to get ready.
CLANK:
But not as much as the autumn fairies, of course, because, well...
BOBBLE:
Yes, Clanky.
Because right now, fairies of every talent are preparing for my favorite season, springtime!
Oh!
ROSETTA:
Get along.
Get along, little sproutlings, and dig.
(ALL TWITTERING)
Hello, there!
Come on, Miss Bell.
You've got to see where we live.
(CHUCKLES)
Welcome to Tinker's Nook.
Oh, wow!
Oh.
Come on.
There's so much to show you.
(TINKER FAIRIES CHATTERING)
(SQUEAKS)
Cute.
Just taking some supplies down...
They're taking supplies down to the workshop.
TINKER FAIRY:
Let her go.
BOBBLE:
Watch out for falling...
Watch out for falling maple seeds!
Wow!
And over here is where most of us live.
There's your house...
There's your house, Tinker Bell.
(TINKER BELL GASPS)
- It's mine?
- CLANK:
Sure is.
We were hoping the new arrival would be one of us, so we got the place all ready.
We rounded up some work clothes...
- We didn't know your size.
- Yes, our apologies, but...
- But they might be too big.
- Yeah, well, that's only...
'Cause you're so tiny.
That'll do, Clank.
Please come on down to the workshop when you're ready.
Fairy Mary will want to meet you.
CLANK:
Goodbye.
Oh.
(CHUCKLES)
(GASPS)
(TINKER FAIRIES CHATTERING)
Stop!
What?
A five-gauge twig for an axle?
Clank, I told you it took a seven.
Oh, Clank, I tell you, sometimes you can be pretty, pretty...
I said seven!
So pretty.
- Who's that, then?
- It's Tinker Bell, you snail brain.
(GASPS)
Wow, everyone seems so busy.
CLANK:
Well, spring won't spring itself.
Indeed, my bellowing buddy. And we tinkers are a big part of it.
Allow us to elucidate, Miss Bell.
- We fiddle and fix.
- We craft and create.
- We carve acorn buckets.
- To hold flower paint.
- Weave saddles and satchels.
- For birdies, you see.
- Make baskets and bushels.
- To carry the seeds!
- BOBBLE:
When preparing for spring.
- We do all this and more!
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!
That was great.
So you see, Miss Bell, we help fairies of every talent with our creations.
Unfortunately, all those fairies are out of luck this year.
Unless we can actually deliver these things to them.
The wagon repairs are finished, I trust?
(BOTH STAMMERING)
Yes, Fairy Mary.
- Tip-top shape.
- No wheels missing whatsoever!
Then let's see it.
- Ah, you see...
Well...
- See,
- with your eyes?
- Define "see," actually...
- You have to meet Tinker Bell! - What?
Who?
- She's new, Fairy Mary.
- Nice to meet you.
Rapture!
A new charge on whom we can lavish all our tinkering wisdom and expertise!
Let me see those hands.
Teetering teapots, so dainty.
Don't worry, dear. We'll build up those tinker muscles in no time.
(CHUCKLES) Okay.
- Now, boys, the deliveries?
- Aye, we're on it.
As a matter of fact, we're heading out right this second.
- But we've only got one wheel.
- What was that?
(STAMMERING) Nothing really, Clank was just asking...
If I can go as well!
- Yeah!
Good one. Very nice.
- Yes!
I wondered that,
- if you could go with us. Yes.
- That's exactly what he was saying.
Very well.
Get on with it, then.
(PANTING)
Slow down, Cheese, I can't keep up!
(SQUEAKS)
TINKER BELL:
The mouse's name is Cheese?
BOBBLE:
Must be.
He always comes when we yell it.
(CROW CAWING)
(SQUEAKS)
(SCREAMS)
(YELLS)
CLANK:
Sprinting thistles!
Bobble!
Bobble!
(SCREAMS)
(BOBBLE EX CLAIMING)
(ALL SHRIEKING)
(THUDDING)
Easy.
Easy, boy.
It's all right. Fawn's got you.
Easy.
Easy, girl.
It's all right. Silvermist's got you.
Oh, you all right, sugar cane?
Be careful, Rosetta, she may faint!
(TINKER BELL GRUNTS)
Elevate her legs.
No, wait. I mean her head.
Wait, wait, wait.
Okay. If she's red, raise the head.
If she's pale, raise the tail.
Does she look pale or red?
She looks squished.
Sorry.
Here, let me, raindrop.
So, what happened to you, anyway?
- Well, I...
- It was sprinting thistles!
(ALL GASPING)
Those weeds are an absolute menace.
Always trampling things, poking people in the petunia.
BOBBLE:
Gather round, ladies.
We've brought some selections from the new spring line of tinker specialties!
- All right!
- Show us, show us!
- What'd you bring?
- Your rainbow tubes, Iridessa.
(GASPS) Finally!
Silvermist, could you help me?
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Oh.
What're you gonna do with that?
I'm gonna take it to the mainland.
What's the mainland?
It's where we're gonna go change winter to spring.
The seasons change all the time there.
I'll get to apply my artistic sensibilities.
And I'll have breakfast ready for all the wittle fuzzies coming out of hibernation.
We just follow the second star...
Ride the breeze, follow the waves...
All the way across the sea...
And then, there it is.
Wow!
The mainland sounds flitterific!
(ALL GIGGLING)
(CHUCKLES) Yes.
The glamorous lives of the nature-talent fairies, eh?
We'd love to stay and chat, but...
But we tinkers have real work to do. Right?
FAWN: Don't get your wings in a bunch. ROSETTA:
Don't be like that.
Nice to meet you all!
FAWN: You, too!
Fly with you later!
ROSETTA: Fly with you later!
BOBBLE:
Right!
Here we are.
A pretty large order of pollen pots for the... (ALL GASPING)
Last thing is berry bushels to deliver to the glen...
Is it okay if I just catch up with you later?
Oh, I suppose.
Can you find your way back?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure I can.
- BOBBLE:
Well, I...
- All right, then.
- Just be careful!
Hi, there!
(VIDIA GASPS)
Sorry.
Vidia, right?
(SNEEZES)
We didn't officially meet.
I'm Tinker Bell.
Oh, yes.
The new girl.
That's right!
So, what's your talent?
What do you think it is?
You're a pollen-izer?
Pollen-ator?
Pollen-picker?
Pollen-plucker?
I am a fast-flying fairy, a true rare talent.
And this is but a small part of what I do.
I make breezes in the summer, blow down leaves in the fall.
My winds even brought you here, dear.
Fairies of every talent depend on me.
Hey, that's just like what I do.
(SNORTS)
Excuse me?
I mean, tinkers help fairies of every talent, too.
So we're kind of the same, you know?
Sweetie, I make forces of nature.
You make pots and kettles.
I work up in the sky, and you work down in a ditch.
Hey!
Don't get me wrong, sunshine.
Being a tinker is really swell and all, but I wouldn't go around bragging about your talent.
It's not like spring depends on you.
Of course it does!
And when I go to the mainland, I'll prove just how important we are.
When who goes to the mainland?
Me, of course!
For spring!
Oh, of course.
You'll prove it, huh?
Yes, I will.
Well, I, for one, am looking forward to that. Excuse me.
No. Excuse me.
"Mine is a rare talent."
Ugh.
Try and tell me tinkers don't matter.
I'll show her what a rare talent really is, when I... (GASPS)
(CLANKING)
(LAUGHING)
(GRUNTS)
Oh.
(TINKER FAIRIES CHATTERING)
(CLANGING)
(BOBBLE AND CLANK EX CLAIM)
- Hey, Tink, what you got there?
- Oh, hi.
I don't know. I just found them.
(SNIFFS)
Lost things.
- Lost things.
- BOBBLE:
Aye.
Stuff gets lost and washes up on Neverland from time to time.
You know, from the mainland.
These come from the mainland?
That place sounds more fascinating all the time.
Berry bushels, check.
Pollen pots, check.
Lost things, check.
Huh?
Lost things?
Why are you fiddling with that junk?
Oh, um...
Well, they were just so unusual.
You mustn't be wasting your time with that rubbish.
And I won't have it cluttering up my workshop.
And as for you two, no more dilly-dallying around.
And don't forget about the Queen's review tonight.
Goodness, there's still so much to be done!
(SIGHS)
Thank you.
Sorry about your trinkets, Miss Bell.
Well, we'd best be getting ready for the review, anyway.
What is the Queen's review?
You see, the Queen is going to review all the preparations for spring!
Yeah, it's a good time for us tinkers to show what we can do, eh?
- Oh, indeed.
- Really?
CLANK:
Like me. I can be a wheel.
Hmm.
Perfect. That's my chance.
Okay, everybody, turn!
Ready for the base coat over here!
Splendid, splendid. Stack those neatly, plenty of time before the Queen arrives.
FLOWER FAIRY 1:
It's the Queen!
What?
She's here?
Now? Play, music fairies.
Yes, play!
(PLAYING CELTIC MUSIC)
Queen Clarion, Your Illustriousness!
As Minister of Spring, I welcome you to Springtime Square.
What?
No fireworks, Minister?
Oh, well, yeah, that could be arranged.
Light fairies!
Light fairies!
I'm teasing.
You always make such a fuss, and everything always turns out wonderfully.
(CHUCKLING)
Well, I think you'll find that we have things well in hand.
When the Everblossom blooms, we'll be ready to bring spring to the mainland!
Music to my ears.
I know you've all put in months of practice and preparation, but keep up the good work these last few days,
- because just as fairies...
- TINKER BELL:
Queen Clarion!
(MUSIC STOPS)
Huh?
Queen Clarion!
- Did I miss anything?
- No, no, no.
Phew!
Good.
It's all right.
I came up with some fantastic things for tinkers to use when we go to the mainland.
(ALL GASPING)
What's she talking about?
TINKER BELL:
Let me show you!
First, baby chipmunks can't eat the whole nut, right?
Their little teeth can't chew big bites.
So you just crank back this lever, and it's... (GRUNTS)
(CRYING)
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
Whoops.
- It's kind of a work in progress.
- Yes, yes, yes. Very clever.
Oh!
And I made this, too.
It's a flower-sprayer.
- QUEEN CLARION:
Tinker Bell, I...
- Here, allow me to demonstrate.
(WHIMPERS)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(MUSIC STOPS)
Sorry.
- But wait till you see this last one.
- Tinker Bell, sweetheart, has no one explained?
Explained what?
Tinker fairies don't go to the mainland, dear.
What?
All of those things are done by the nature-talent fairies.
Your work is here in Pixie Hollow.
- But I thought that...
- I'm sorry, Tinker Bell.
Oh, okay. No.
No, that's good.
I mean, I really couldn't make it anyway.
So, good.
Yeah.
This actually works out good.
I mean, well...
So, I'm just gonna...
Yeah.
(FAIRY MARY HUMMING)
Back so soon?
You didn't go?
Goodness, no.
Far too much work to do down here.
(GRUNTING)
Vidia was right.
Being a tinker stinks.
Excuse me?
It's just, why don't we get to go to the mainland?
The mainland?
Who gives a pile of pebbles about the mainland?
But, Fairy Mary, the other fairies get to go.
Now, Tinker Bell, are you a garden fairy?
Well, no.
- Are you a light fairy?
- No.
Animal fairy?
Water fairy, perhaps?
No and no.
No. You're not.
You are a tinker.
It's who you are.
Be proud of it.
The day you can magically make the flowers grow, or capture the rays of the sun and whatnot, then you can go.
Until then, your work is here.
(SIGHS)
Good idea, Fairy Mary.
FLOWER FAIRY 1:
Get your pixie dust yet?
SPARROWMAN 1:
Just did.
- Nice day for flying.
- FLOWER FAIRY 1:
Sure is.
Here you go, Silvermist.
Thank you, Terence.
I hope Tinker Bell is okay.
I know. That poor little sapling.
She looked pretty wilted yesterday.
Well, I wouldn't blame her if she stayed in bed all day.
Morning, girls!
ROSETTA:
Tinker Bell?
FAWN:
Tinker Bell?
Guess what?
I've decided I'm not gonna be a tinker fairy anymore.
- What?
- What?
Well, I was thinking.
Why do I have to be a tinker?
Just 'cause some silly hammer glowed?
I mean, who's to say it wasn't some big mistake?
Maybe I can just switch my talent.
Switch your talent?
I don't know, Tinker Bell...
If you could teach me your talents, any of them, maybe I could show the Queen I can work with nature, too.
(BUZZING)
And then she'd let me go to the mainland for spring.
Oh, Tinker Bell.
That's just not how it works.
- Well, maybe she could.
- She's right. She could.
Well, I've never heard of someone switching talents before.
She's right. Me, neither.
Look. You all do things that are beautiful and magical and important.
But me, well, there's gotta be more to my life than just pots and kettles.
All I'm asking is that you give me a chance.
I'll help you, Tinker Bell.
Thank you, Sil.
Me, too. Could be fun.
Well, first time for everything, I guess. What harm can come from trying?
Well, I still think this is a bad idea.
(FROG CROAKING)
SILVERMIST:
So, for your first day of water fairy training,
I could show you how to make ripples in the pond.
Okay!
Or teach you how to talk to the babbling brook.
Oh, that sounds fun, too.
Or wait, wait, wait.
I got it, I got it, I got it!
Dewdrops on spider webs!
Come on. I'll show you how to do it.
- Good luck, Tink!
- You can do it!
Oh, um...
Go get 'em.
Just cup your hands like this, reach into the water, and...
Okay, you've heard of a dewdrop?
This is a don't drop.
That's water fairy humor.
It's good.
Come on.
Okay, Tink, now, this next part can be a little tricky.
It takes a very steady, delicate hand to...
Where's your dewdrop?
Oh.
(GIGGLES)
Forgot my dewdrop.
I did it.
Shake that one off. Shake it off. You can do this!
That's it. That's it, Tink.
You're... (GROANS)
Now, Tink, try to...
No, no, sweetie, you need to...
Well, maybe if you... (SPLASHING)
Well, you have to admire her persistence.
SILVERMIST:
Tinker Bell!
Although, sometimes hammers glow for a reason.
(TINKER BELL GROANS)
Whoa.
(ALL GASPING)
(ALL SCREAMING)
You know, you always struck me as a light fairy kind of gal.
(SCREAMS)
(BOBBLE HUMMING)
(SINGING) Here we go in the treasure...
- Have you seen Tink?
- No, thank you. Not thirsty!
No, no.
Not "drink," Tink!
Pink?
I like purple meself!
Tink!
Have you seen Tink?
What?
I do not stink! Maybe it's you, eh?
Hey, have you seen Tink?
We'd better take some of this off Miss Bell's plate, so...
- CLANK: All right, then.
- No, no, no! Wait, wait, Clank!
What are...
Will you two stop mucking about?
- What Clank did was, he took it off...
- Bobble told me that I should...
I see Tinker Bell has got her work done, mysteriously.
Where is she, anyway?
(BOTH STAMMERING)
Well, you see, she's...
She went with Cheese to... (GASPS)
No, no. Clank means she went to get cheese, you see,
- the food, for Cheese the mouse...
- Yes, the food, for Cheese the mouse.
...because he was whining.
Yeah. Like a baby.
BOBBLE:
Like a wittle, wee baby, there.
Okay, what can I teach you that's gonna do the least amount of damage?
Oh, I know. Follow me, Tinker Bell.
The last light of day, it's the richest kind of all!
Wait for it. Wait for it.
Okay, and now!
Oh, wow.
Huh?
It's incredible.
Now for the fun part.
- Do you think it's heavy?
- No. It's light.
(EXAGGERATED LAUGH)
(WHISTLES)
(BUZZING)
Okay, okay.
(GROANS)
Stay.
- Here, Tink. Let me...
- No! I almost got it.
If I just get you started...
This is impossible!
Look out!
(GASPS)
Oh, no.
Whoa!
I wonder how it's going.
Fly, Tink, fly!
Uh-oh.
FAWN:
We'll save you, Tink!
SILVERMIST:
Bob and weave!
Bob and weave!
ROSETTA: Cover your tushy!
(CLANK HUMMING)
- We fiddle and fix.
- Craft and create.
- Carve acorn buckets.
- To hold flower paint.
- Preparing for spring.
- CLANK:
We do all this and more.
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!
(BOTH GIGGLING)
FAIRY MARY: Tinker Bell, I'd like a word with you.
Fairy Mary!
See, I was on my deliveries, and it's actually kind of...
Save it.
I know what you've been up to, missy.
And I had such high hopes for you.
(BOTH HUMMING)
(SIGHS)
- You'd do well to listen to her...
- Why?
So I can do this my whole life?
I don't wanna be just a stupid tinker!
No, no, not that you guys are...
I didn't mean that...
Guys, I wasn't...
I have to go.
Now, flap them. Flap them.
That's it!
Have fun!
Hey, Tink! You ready?
A little nervous, actually.
Oh, don't be silly.
Come on, you'll be fine.
FAWN: We're teaching baby birds how to fly.
First, you have to get their attention.
Smile and establish trust.
See?
Okay, open your wings, honey, and flap them up and down.
Up and down. That's the way. Faster, faster.
That's right.
Yes! You're doing it! Okay.
Come out this way a little bit.
You're okay. You're okay. You got it.
Keep flapping, keep flapping!
Hey, why don't you help that last little guy?
(GROANS)
Okay, okay.
Just smile and establish trust.
Hi, there!
Hey, little fella, you wanna do some flap-flap today?
Oh, sure you do!
All you do is, you just flap your wings, like this.
No, no, no.
None of that. Come on. All we got to do is...
Ow!
Look. I'm going to level with you, okay?
I kind of bombed out on the whole water and light fairy things, and I'm starting to run out of options here.
If you could see fit to flap your little wings and take flight for a few measly seconds,
I might be able to go to the mainland and bring happiness to the world!
What do you say?
Wrong answer.
(SQUAWKS)
If I end up making acorn kettles for the rest of my life,
I am holding you personally responsible.
(SQUAWKING)
(LAUGHING) Hey, hey. Look at this!
Okay, just stop squirming.
Would you just...
Hey!
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm letting go.
I am letting go.
This is not working.
Hey, maybe that guy can help.
He's a really good flyer.
Hey, up there!
(HAWK SCREECHING)
(GASPS)
Hawk!
(BLOWING HORN)
- FAIRY 1:
What's happening?
- Quick, hide!
FAIRY 2:
Look out!
(SCREECHING)
(TINKER BELL SHRIEKS)
A hawk!
Tinker Bell's in trouble!
- Hey!
- Vidia?
This is my hiding spot!
(BOTH SCREAM)
But it's all yours, now.
No!
- Get him!
- ALL:
Get him!
(GRUNTS)
FAIRY 1:
What?
FAIRY 2:
You all right?
FAIRY 1:
So scary.
(ALL CHATTERING)
(ALL SNICKERING)
Are you okay, Vidia?
(GROWLS)
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch me!
I'm fine!
- But I was only trying to help.
- Well, stop trying.
Tinker Bell...
I can't hold water.
I can't hold light.
Birds hate me.
I'm just so useless!
Tink.
Great. I failed for the third time in a row.
At this rate, I should get to the mainland right about...
Oh... Never!
(METALLIC CLANG)
Huh?
Yes!
Sil!
(MELODY PLAYS)
(GASPS)
(ALL GASPING)
Beautiful.
(MELODY PLAYING)
FAWN:
You fixed it!
SILVERMIST:
Wow!
IRIDESSA:
Beautiful!
ROSETTA:
Amazing!
What are you guys doing here?
IRIDESSA:
It might be the sparkliest thing I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of sparkly things!
It's a really pretty thingy.
What is it?
I don't know.
I just found it.
Tinker Bell, don't you even realize what you're doing?
You're tinkering!
What?
No, no, this isn't...
I was just...
Creating those gadgets, figuring things out, fixing stuff like this, that's what tinkering is, sweetie!
Don't you like doing this?
Isn't it what you really love?
Well, I do, remember?
I want to see where these things come from.
Why are you saying this?
Are you just giving up on me?
I mean, aren't you going to teach me to be a garden fairy anymore?
Sweet pea, I think this is your talent.
Tink, we just want you to be happy.
If you really want me to be happy, you'll help me get to the mainland like you promised.
Please, Tinker Bell, just think about it.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Will you teach me how to be a fast-flying fairy?
Please?
I know I could do it!
With your help, I could be flying as fast as you in no time.
Vidia, you're my last hope.
All my friends have given up on me.
Rosetta won't even try to teach me to be a garden fairy now.
I bet I could at least paint some flowers or plant some sproutlings.
I mean, there must be something I could do.
Or if you really want to be a garden fairy... (SQUEAKING)
Capture the sprinting thistles.
Well, okay.
I can do this.
Yeah!
Okay.
Ready, Cheese?
Come on.
They're just weeds.
Besides, there were only seven or eight at the most, right?
Hyah!
We can do this.
I know we can do this.
What do you say?
Attaboy.
This ought to be good.
Hey!
TINKER BELL:
Come on, you!
Oh, come on!
Just a bit this way!
It's working! It's working!
Come on!
(GRUNTS)
Wait, wait, wait.
Come back!
Come back!
These things just won't listen!
Come on, Cheese.
Go, go, go!
Okay, definitely more than eight.
Please file into the corral in an orderly manner!
Wait!
Oh, no!
Come on!
Come on, now.
(RUMBLING)
TINKER BELL:
Sorry.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
So sorry.
This is the last batch.
(GARDEN FAIRIES SCREAMING)
GARDEN FAIRY:
Look out!
Sorry.
Sorry!
Oh, no.
Tink.
What happened?
- I...
- Tinker Bell, what did you think you were doing?
I was just...
I was just trying to...
I thought if I could capture the thistles, then...
There isn't a garden fairy alive who can control those weeds!
- What were you trying to prove?
- I...
She's right, Tink.
This has all gone too far.
By the second star!
All the preparations for spring...
How did this...
Queen Clarion, it was me.
I did it.
It was all my fault.
Tinker Bell.
(WEEPING) I...
I'm sorry.
SPRING:
I don't think we can fix this in time.
We're going to have to cancel spring, or postpone it at the very least.
WINTER:
What, and put my snowflake fairies back to work?
Oh, no.
SUMMER:
But we can't!
We can't do that!
If the snow isn't melted, the seedlings won't grow, the fruit won't ripen in the summer...
And in the autumn, there will be nothing to harvest.
Spring must happen on time, or the balance of nature will be undone!
There must be something we can do!
Certainly this has happened before!
It has!
Did you ever hear of the Ice Age?
Settle down, all of you.
Fairy Mary, is it even possible to redo everything in such a short time?
- No.
- SPRING:
Oh, no.
We were so close, and now it's all gone.
SUMMER:
Who's going to paint our leaves now?
AUTUMN:
The apples and pumpkins will never grow.
SUMMER:
No rolling hills covered in daffodils?
SPRING:
And it took months to harvest all those seeds!
Animals waking from hibernation will have nothing to eat!
You okay, Tink?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just came hoping to get a quick refill.
I'm going away for a while.
Oh.
- Well, how long you going to be gone?
- Well, actually, forever.
Forever? Well,
(CHUCKLES) in that case, a double scoop.
Forever's a pretty long time, so I hear.
Thanks, Terence.
You know my name?
Well, sure.
Why wouldn't I?
I don't know.
I'm just a dust-keeper guy.
I'm not exactly seen as the most important fairy in Pixie Hollow.
Terence, what are you talking about?
You're probably the most important one there is!
Without you, no one would have any magic!
Why, your talent makes you who you are!
- You should be proud of it!
I mean... - I am.
(STAMMERING) I'd better get going.
Hey, Cheese.
"Be proud of your talent." What talent?
I couldn't even get these silly things to work.
Lost things.
That's it!
Attention, everyone!
I'm afraid I have distressing news.
There is no way spring can come on time.
Months of work was lost, and it will take us months to restore it all.
So when the Everblossom opens tomorrow,
I'm afraid we will not be going to the mainland for spring.
(ALL MURMURING)
Wait!
I know how we can fix everything!
Tinker Bell?
Tinker Bell, I don't think this is...
Just hear me out.
Please.
You!
How long does it take you to paint a ladybug?
I don't know. 10, 15 minutes, I guess.
(WHIMPERS)
See?
We can build more.
I can show you how.
Making paint, gathering seeds, we can do it all in no time.
We have to at least try!
Wait a...
Are we really gonna listen to her?
She's the reason we're in this mess in the first place!
But I can fix it.
Yippee!
Tinker Bell's going to save us with her dopey little doohickeys.
- VIDIA:
Hide the squirrels!
- What is your problem, Vidia?
Why do you think you're so much better than me?
I am better than you, sweetie. I didn't ruin spring.
At least now I'm trying to help.
Have you ever helped anyone besides yourself?
Well, I tried to help you!
Maybe I should have told you to capture the hawk instead of the thistles!
(ALL GASPING)
Perhaps Tinker Bell was not the only one responsible.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
It seems to me that your fast-flying talent is well-suited to chasing down each and every one of the thistles.
Me?
Yes.
And I expect them all to be returned to Needlepoint Meadow as soon as possible.
But that could take forever!
Then I suggest you get started.
Now, Tinker Bell, are you sure you can do this?
Yes.
Because I'm a tinker.
It's who I am.
And tinkers fix things.
But I can't do it alone.
BOTH:
Command us, Miss Bell.
- I'll help.
- Show us how, Tink!
- I'll help you.
- Me, too!
Okay, gather up all the twigs you can, all different sizes, and tree sap.
We need lots of that.
But most importantly, we need to find lost things.
Okay, what have you got?
- How about this?
- Will this do?
Can you use this fuzzy thing, Miss Bell?
- Oh, yeah!
- BOBBLE:
It's not fuzzy.
- CLANK:
Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.
Twig.
Hammer.
Magnification, please.
Thank you.
And that's how you do it!
Now, what do you suppose the... (BLOWS MELODY)
You smell funny.
Oh!
- I saw it first.
- I bumped into it.
TINKER BELL:
Just tie this off here.
So, you just squeeze this, then let it go, and...
See?
Simple!
Now, just put the berries in, and we'll have plenty of paint in no time!
(ALL CHEERING)
Six, seven and eight.
(ALL CHEERING)
You did it, Tinker Bell.
You saved spring.
We all did it.
Queen Clarion?
Can't Tink come with us to the mainland?
Yeah, she's done so much for everyone.
No, no, you guys, really. I don't need to go.
Buttercup, it's what you wanted.
It's okay.
My work is here.
And I still have so much to do.
I gotta...
FAIRY MARY:
Not here, you don't!
Well... But I don't...
Surprise, Miss Bell.
We found your tiny dancer!
Actually, I ran across this myself many seasons ago.
I didn't have a clue what it was or how to fix it.
But you did, Tinker Bell.
You are quite a rare talent indeed.
And I'd imagine there's a little girl out there who's missing this.
What do you mean?
How...
I think that perhaps a certain tinker fairy might have a job to do after all, on the mainland.
You mean, I...
IRIDESSA:
I knew you'd get to go!
FAWN:
Oh, Tink!
- We can help, Miss Bell.
- We can help.
I'm strong.
I'm so happy for you.
Come on.
We gotta go line up.
Thank you, Your Highness.
But how will I find who it belongs to?
You'll know.
Now go!
Good heavens.
Thank you.
Tink.
Hey, something to help you on the mainland.
Terence, that's so sweet.
Good luck, Tink.
To the air, fairies!
To the air!
The mainland awaits!
NARRATOR: (SINGING) Come away with me now to the sky
Up o'er the hills and the sea
Far beyond where our memories lie
To a place where I'm free to be me
Oh gather ye now one and all
No matter what all ye may do
Let the stars fill your soul when the moon cradles all
So to yourself be true
The blanket of snow is all gone
Each flower waits for the sun
And the whispering tears of the rain
Holds promise for everyone
Then come away with me friends
No matter where you call your home
With a light in our hearts We will never part
Fairies to the north!
Fairies to the south!
To the east and west!
Deep in the forest we go
The creatures are all fast asleep
Wake up, sleepyheads!
Come on!
There you go.
Good squirrel.
With a kiss and a wink we will waken our souls
While always their safety we'll keep
And then, then we'll dance through the night
Till the sunbeams sparkle at dawn
And away we will go Like last winter's snow
Soon our work will be done
Oh gather ye now one and all
No matter what all ye may do
Let the stars fill your soul when the moon cradles all
So to yourself be true
Oh gather ye now one and all
No matter what all ye may do
Let the stars fill your soul when the moon cradles all
So to yourself be true
(WHISTLES)
So to yourself be true

Mummy!

MRS. DARLING:
Yes, Wendy. What is it, darling?
NARRATOR:
A fairy's work is much more than, at first, it might appear.
You did it!
Suppose your broken clock ticks, though it hasn't in a year.
(CHIMING)
Perchance you find a toy you lost, or jingling bells you hear.
It all means that one very special fairy might be near.
(SINGING) Watch all the flowers dance with the wind
Listen to snowflakes whisper your name
Feel all the wonder lifting your dreams
You can fly
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly to your heart
Touch every rainbow painting the sky
Look at the magic glide through your life
A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night
You can fly
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
When you believe you'll find your wings
Fly
To your heart
Rise to the heights of all you can be
Soar on the hope of marvelous things
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
When you believe you'll find your wings
Fly
Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly
You can fly
To your heart

Honestly, it's the one thing I get to do on this ship.
Well, good morning, everybody, and welcome to day 255,642 aboard the Axiom.
As always, the weather is a balmy 72 degrees and sunny and...
Oh, I see the ship's log is showing that today is our 700th anniversary of our five-year cruise.
Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be proud to know that 700 years later we'd be doing the exact same thing they were doing.
Fore!
So, be sure next mealtime to ask for your "free

Wow, look at that!
Also today we have a...
Hey, Auto, what's that flashing button?
Captain, Probe One has returned positive.
Positive?
EVE.
But no probe's ever come back positive before.
# Buy N Large #
Greetings and congratulations, Captain.
If you are seeing this, that means your Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, or EVE probe, has returned from Earth with a confirmed specimen of ongoing photosynthesis.
That's right.
It means it's time to go back home.
Home?
We're going back?
Now that Earth has been restored to a life-sustaining status, by golly, we can begin Operation Recolonize.
Simply follow this manual's instructions to place the plant in your ship's holo-detector and the Axiom will immediately navigate your return to Earth.
- It's that easy.
- Huh!
Now, due to the effects of microgravity, you and your passengers may have suffered some slight bone loss.
But I'm sure a few laps around the ship's jogging track will get you back in shape in no time.
We have a jogging track?
If you have any further questions, just consult your operation manual.
See you back home real soon.
"Operate Manuel."
Uh...
Manuel, relay instructions.
Manuel?
Wow.
Will you look at that?
Let's see.
Huh?

Well, let's open her up.

Ooh.

Where is it?
Maybe we missed a step.
- Show me how you change...
- Plant.
- Okay.
- WALL-E.
WALL-E!
- EVE?
- Plant!
Why don't you scan her to be sure?
Contains no specimen.
Probe's memory is faulty.
- So then, we're not going to Earth?
- Negative.
I guess things go back to normal, huh?
Correct, Captain.
- Well, false alarm!
- False alarm.
The probe must be defective.
GO-4, send her to the repair ward, and have them run diagnostics on her.
Ah!

Hi.
Hi.
Define "hoedown."
Hoedown, a social gathering at which lively dancing would take place.
Auto, Earth is amazing!
These are called "farms."
Humans would put seeds in the ground, pour water on them, and they grow food, like pizza.
Good night, Captain.
Psst!
Computer.
Define "dancing."
Dancing, a series of movements involving two partners where speed and rhythm match harmoniously with music.

"Yay, Captain!
Captain, we're home!
It's so beautiful!"
"No.
It's nothing.
I was pleased to do this.
"It's all about you people.
It's not about me."
How?
How did you find it?
We can go back home!
For the first time!
- What's it like now?
- Oh!
No, no, no.
Don't tell me.
I want to see for myself.
Wait.
That doesn't look like Earth.
Where's the blue sky?
Where's the grass?

We have to go back.

- Aye, aye, sir.
WALL-E.
WALL-E.
Auto, EVE found the plant.
Fire up the holo-detector.
Not necessary, Captain.
You may give it to me.
- You know what?
I should do it myself.
- Captain.
Sir, I insist you give me the plant.
- Auto, get out of my way.
- We cannot go home.
- What are you talking about?
Why not? - That is classified, Captain.
- Give me the plant.
- What do you mean, "classified"?
You don't keep a secret from the captain.
Give me the plant.
- Tell me what's classified.
- The plant.
Tell me, Auto!
That's an order.
Aye, aye, sir.
# Buy N Large is your superstore We got all you need #
Just cut it off, will you?
Hey,there,autopilots.
Got some bad news.
Um...
Operation Cleanup has, well, failed.
Wouldn't you know, rising toxicity levels have made life unsustainable on Earth.
"Unsustainable"?
What?
Darn it all, we're going to have to cancel Operation Recolonize.
So, just stay the course.
Um...
Rather than try and fix this problem, it'll just be easier for everyone to remain in space.
"Easier"?
- Huh?
- Sir, time to go.
Okay. I'm giving Override Directive A 113.
Go to full autopilot.
Take control of everything, and do not return to Earth.
Repeat, do not return to Earth.
Let'sget the heck out of here.
Now, the plant.
No.
Wait a minute.
Computer, when was that message sent out to the Axiom?
Message received in the year 2110.
That's...
That's nearly 700 years ago!
Auto, things have changed!
We've got to go back.
Sir, orders are "do not return to Earth."
But life is sustainable now.
Look at this plant.
Green and growing.
- It's living proof he was wrong.
- Irrelevant, Captain.
What?
It's completely relevant!
Out there is our home.
Home, Auto.
And it's in trouble.
I can't just sit here and do nothing.
That's all I've ever done.
That's all anyone on this blasted ship has ever done.
Nothing!
On the Axiom you will survive.
- I don't want to survive.
I want to live!
- Must follow my directive.
I'm the captain of the Axiom.
We are going home today.
GO-4?
Hey!
That's not...
This is mutiny!

I'll have activated the holo-detector.

The man taken on a stretcher is none other than my friend Arya.
Ever since I got acquainted to him, I didn't have any more enemies.
Because if you've a friend like Arya, you don't need another enemy at all.
Mother Theresa Orphanage
Name?
- Arya.
- Age?
- 9 years.
Native place?
- Don't know.
Any relative?
Drink water!
I want a friend!
If I hadn't stepped on the bubble gum that day, my life would've been different.
Bloody!
I can't get it off my slipper.
Who are you?
Why are you sitting in my place?
I'm your friend.
- Friend?
A friend must help, did you help me till now?
Do you know to swim?
No, I can't.
- Why?
Friends!
I became his friend from that day.
He became my enemy.
Why are you so late?
Ajay
Why did you do it?
- l'm your friend, right?
Are you my friend?
Are you my friend?
Do it little slowly...slowly...
Arya
Ajay Arya
Arya, Ajay, sir is calling you both.
They liked you both.
But they want only one of you two.
You both are best friends, decide who will go with them.
One minute.
Heads or tails?
- Heads, no...no...tails.
You go...
Why?
You won the toss, right?
Tails you win and whatever you win is mine.
Go!
I was very happy.
Not because I was leaving, but for going away from him.
I thought I left him for all good, but... I want to be with Ajay.
I want to be with Ajay.
Drag him out boys!
Get down!
What did you abuse from inside?
He used bad words in English, boss.
- English?
Come on, come again.
Come again.
What are you looking at?
Go now, if I see you again, I'll thrash you.
Are you great if you're in a BMW?
Bloody!
Take right from the KBR park main road.

Yes, why?
You must be wearing a cap.
I don't use cap in home, why?
- Just a minute.
Who are you man?
Who are you man?
Tell me...
You're dead man!
Who are you man?
Hey!
Who are you man?
Who are you?
Ajay's friend.
Who are you guys?
Prakash's friends.
- Friends?
Will you watch fun somebody beating up your friend?
How many times I've told it's impossible for you to stay with me?
First time I came to a police station because of you.
Do you remember the first time we smoked?
Ever since then I smoke only half cigarette.
Take your half.
Whatever you may say, it's impossible that you stay with me.
I'll give whatever you want, start your own business.
Go slow!
I'm telling you. Can't you hear it?
You and your style, I can't tell anyone that you're my friend.
I get irritated if you're with me.
You're very bad, I can't tolerate you.
If you're with me, not only me even my company will get bad name.
Stay away from me.
Vehicles are coming.
Hey stop!
Apply brake.
- Brake?
Where is it?
Don't you know to drive?
- First time.
What are you waiting for?
Pull me up!
I'll be with you only.
Let's discuss it later, first pull me up.
I'll be with you only.
What job can I offer you?
You're not even a graduate.
My degree, I earned it.
What's this discussion hanging for life?
I'm staying with you.
- Okay, I agree, pull me up.
I'm offering you a job in my company, please save me.
What?
Mad boy!
You're my best friend.
I would've saved you even if you didn't want, why did you accept?
But on one condition, if proven bad, I'll dismiss you.
If I'm proven as bad, I'll quit the company.
I want everyone to say I'm a good boy.
Hero is on move...
Nobody can catch him...
Very smart...
Very clever...
He wears a mask...
Salt and camphor do look alike...
But don't cheated by his innocent face...
He's a cheat...
He's a fraud...
Don't fall into his trap...
He's most cunning...
His timing is perfect...
He's wrong in right...
He's king in palaces...
Changes colour faster than chameleon...
Master in planning...
Don't try to find a defect in him, you can never find it...
Oh he's a big cheat...
I know very well about him...
My tongue has gone dry saying about him...
But nobody believes it...
Moreover there's great demand for such guys...
But anyway I'll try once again...
I'll surely rip out his skin...
Sorry, I want to be a good boy.
That's why I don't smoke when people are around...
Cat walking beauties...
Don't fall for him...
Don't get swept...
don't fall flat...
Life is watching...
He's fox under the garb of sheep...
His mind is like manhole...
He's a cheat...and very cheap guy...
He's confusing puzzle...
Don't trust the heart hijacker...
He's a magician...
Don't touch him...
Oh My god!
He's a black sheep...
If you give him a chance, he'll steal everything...
Oh God!
He raises dust...
Some nymph from heaven must stop him...
You got best employee award.
Sir, feed a sweet to your friend.
He's not my friend!
I feel like shouting loudly!
But can't do it.
Sir, feed a sweet to your friend.
He appears always as an enemy.
I want him out but he's pitching in.
He's everything, Ajay is nothing.
But Ajay boasts as if it's all his.
Without Arya, he's nothing, he got lucky.
I felt like everyone was discussing about me only.
Though this office is mine, but I feel it's not.
My office, the suit I'm wearing, my home, my cars, my status, I feel it's all aims given by him.
Even the cigarette I'm smoking now.
I feel that too is not mine.
But for the first time in life I felt something is mine at first sight.
Geetha.
Geetha sister, come.
Bye sister!
You're going to hi-tech city, aren't you?
Look, how I got it right!
Don't consider me cheap for taking lift.
Today is my first day in office, I don't want to be late.
Can I switch on the radio?
We too have many cars, I can also use a car.
But my father insists me to marry if I want to use a car.
Can't marry to use a car, right?
This is not your car, right?
Though it is yours, you feel it is not, right?
Did you see how I found it?
If it was your car, would you pose for photo while driving?
Little further.
Little further.
Just a show off to get down at the entrance.
We are best friends, right?
What?
- l'll spin the coin.
Heads or tails?
Heads, Geetha is mine.
- No, she's mine.
We are friends, whatever you win is mine.
Whatever I win is yours.
So, Geetha is mine.
You're hurt because Arya doesn't love you.
What do you feel when you're happy?
- l feel like hugging Arya.
What do you feel when you're angry?
I feel like hugging Arya tightly.
You're totally mad.
No use, put a line between you and Arya.
Who is HR here?
- No informality, please be formal.
That means it's you!
Did you see how found it?
I treat software professionals affected with psychological problems.
Come, I'll introduce your team.
Money and health problems are abundant in software field.
So, I remember health problems more than their names.
He does everything three times.
Except birth.
Neither he knows nor I know when he'll sleep and when he'll wake up.
He got up, take his photo, he may sleep again.
He slept!
He is...
You are...?
He's Ghajini, short term memory.
He sees me everyday but doesn't remember me, how can he remember you?
It's useless to introduce him.
What man?
- To my office sir.
Your office is in ninth floor, this is sixth floor.
Can't differentiate between 6 and 9, his office is in ninth floor but works in sixth floor, yours is ninth floor, get going!
To tell about me...
- Wait, I'll tell you.
You are kleptomaniac, you've two weaknesses, one is lpod.
- Gift from brother-in-law.
Second is laptop.
- Gift from Bill gates.
You love those gifts.
Did you see how I found it?
I'm like that, I can read faces and tell the character.
You forgot to take my photo.
So, nobody here is perfect.
All are defective.
There's a person without any defect.
He'll not even look at girls.
You're not supposed to say it, I must say it.
Where is your Mr. Perfect?
Your team, new recruit.
I know it's common in software for team leaders to harass girls.
But everyone here say that you're decent and sincere, and that you don't even look at girls.
I didn't believe them but felt that on seeing you.
That you're perfect guy.
You're afraid of lifts, right?
Did you see how I found it?
Mr. Perfect, you've a little defect.
Getting a team leader like you is small defect, I praised you.
No reaction for it too.
What?
- Arya kissed me.
What else?
Did he hug too?
Did he say I love you?
is it comedy to you?
I too felt the same thing when I first met Arya.
Like getting kissed, like getting hugged, not only me any girl would feel the same on seeing Arya.
It seems Geetha too has fallen flat for Arya.
No Shanthi, Arya really kissed me.
He's like that!
He disturbs everyone.
But he never falls for anyone.
Geetha, you told me but don't tell this with anyone else, because Arya is perfect, that's it!
Do you say it was my imagination?
- No, hallucination.
First stage of hallucination.
Arya kissed you?
This is a psychological disorder.
You feel what had happened wasn't real, or imagine what didn't happen had really happened, you mind keeps on going somewhere...
- Where?
Go away.
- Who is he?
Luckily you said Arya kissed you, so I could diagnose it easily.
No sir, Arya really kissed me.
Did anyone see Arya kissing you?
Geetha too wouldn't have seen it.
- Why?
Generally girls close eyes at that time, sir.
You keep shut.
Answer me straightly.
What do you feel when you're happy?
Trust me sir, Arya really kissed me, sir.
So, you feel like Arya kissing you.
What?
- l am angry.
What do you feel when you're angry?
Do you feel like beating or scratch or feel like doing something?
What do you feel like doing?
I think she feels like breaking the cell phone, sir.
Yours is ninth floor?
- Yes sir.
- Get going.
- No problem sir.
You...?
Do you know what is this?
Geetha's resignation letter.
She resigned the job but I forced her to reconsider it.
Do you've sense?
Will you kiss at first sight?
I told you already I'll dismiss you if proven you're bad.
is it proved?
Anyone in office believes I did it?
Why did you feel like kissing her?
What was your feeling now?
I felt like I was dying.
- l too felt the same.
I felt I would die if I don't kiss Geetha.
How much you love Geetha?
How much I like you?
I love Geetha that much.
is it enough if you love Geetha?
Do you think Geetha too loves you?
I'm sure she'll love me.
Because any girl would prefer the best.
As far I know there only two best people in this world.
Number one is you and number two is me.
You're number one because I've accepted you as number one.
Anyway you, number one dropped out of race, so I'm the only one.
She must love me.
Can't avoid.
I want to write a love letter to Geetha.
What is this?
Do you want to write a love letter to Geetha?
If you do anything stupid like this, you've to leave me forever.
Please don't say like that, I can't live without you..
I don't have anyone other than you.
Please, I'll listen to whatever you say.
Love letters in Email times?
My dear Geetha, I must tell I love you first, and then write the letter, and then kiss you.
But I couldn't hold myself and kissed you first.
Now I'm writing a letter.
I'll say I love you later.
So, last is first and first is last, and feel about the middle one later.
You must know about me.
I smoke cigarette, I drink, lf l get angry, I'll beat anyone, I'll be happy if you still love me after knowing this, I can't read it any more.
Dasavatharam is very good man.
Please don't show this letter to him.
Because he'll not believe it.
I don't believe it.
Why not sir?
- He wrote I'll not believe it.
Will you stop believing if he writes it?
If I believe even after he has written, trust may lose faith in belief.
Look, how much Arya loves me in this letter which he didn't write.
So you don't believe because Arya wrote you'll not believe, right?
That's all!
- Who wrote you'll not believe it?
Arya!
- Where?
- ln the letter.
Who wrote the letter?
- Arya.
How did I get caught?
- Why are you getting confused, sir?
Arya is writing something there, check his hand writing with this letter, so simple.
Yours is ninth floor.
- But problem is in sixth floor, sir.
You're making me test a gentleman.
You check.
- Okay.
How could Arya write this letter?
- Check it with his hand writing.
Please write, I love you.
What's the spelling sir?
Tell him the spelling.
Though Arya didn't write the letter, she hallucinates he has.
Sir, I'm not hallucinating.
- You're angry, aren't you?
I expected this and changed the original with dummy.
Look there sir.
- Where?
- There!
Bill Gates too is bombed!
- Go to ninth floor, go!
Watch out!
If I don't prove you're a cheat, henceforth my name shall not be Geetha.
If you've guts, you must write the letter, not use services of someone else.
Sorry for writing the letter with my left hand, when will you give the opportunity to write with my right hand?
Geetha, come I'll give you lift.
Geetha, please stop.
Please come, new car, new design.
Why did you say Arya wrote that letter?
You could've told my name, couldn't you?
I would've accepted happily.
Everyone would've believed it.
Do you know how you impressed me for the first time?
The moment you broke Dasavatharam's cell phone, you broke my heart too.
- Just stop the car.
Please give me your phone number to talk to you.
- Take down.
is it 96 or 69?
Seat where Geetha sat is so hot.
Buddy, I got her to board my car.
- That sixth floor girl.
I'll call you later.
What's this car?
Why is it masked?
Where is my car?
If you dare to see Geetha again...
Lower your voice.
- A dangerous thing happened sir.
Geetha has a lover.
Yesterday I gave life to Geetha, he smashed my car with a masked car.
My car has broken into pieces.
Till now I thought only I got my things broken up, yours too has been broken.
- Totally broken.
Nothing remains?
- Look, just this number plate sir.
Was this car met with an accident?
- Yes sir.
Was this car smashed into pieces?
Yes sir, 666 is my car number only sir.
This is not 666 but 999.
This is my car!
Hold this sir.
I'll take that one.
Don't know why all your things are getting broken?
Sorry, I don't drink.
is it?
He got the best employee award too.
Why is he emptying it into the sink?
Mixing it.
Me?
I didn't touch you.
- No, you touched me.
I know you touched me.
You touched me!
Somebody has lost a cell phone.
Arya was drinking and I captured it in my cell phone.
I was coming to show you.
He misbehaved with me.
He touched me, sir.
Did you capture video of Arya having drinks?
Cell phone is broken.
I broke it in a fit of anger.
Really!
Poor girl has hallucination problem.
She imagines what had happened as not happened and vice versa.
Sir, he really touched me.
Say sorry to her.
No need of it, say normally.
Touched you really.
Hair?
Her eyes are more sexy.
I didn't touch you, you felt like I touched you.
Feelings were shattering, babe.
I didn't touch you.
If you feel that I touched you, I'm so sorry.
My top and your bottom is matching.
I didn't take your id card, if you feel I had, I'm sorry.
Buddy!
A toy car!
All the kick has come down.
Start the car.
Put him in back.
- Okay, go back.
Push...
- You pull!
Run boys!
Must tear the red shirt!
French beard guy mustn't see this world again.
Guy with ear ring must lose his ring!
Must break the head of the skinhead!
For this tidal wave of love...
Why just a fist size of heart?
For this unknown happiness...
Why does it need a language?
For this sweet pain...
Why the tears are salty?
For even a blink's distance...
Why one gets dejected?
For the eyes that see you...
Why does it need this world?
For four letter word...
Why so many punishments?
Though I stop breathing...
Though I am dead...
You come into my eyes...
You cut my dreams...
You kill me once atleast every second...
You're cool like snow...
But you burn me like fire...
You chase me and burn my heart to ashes...
If you take a breath...
My life span will increase, my love...
Don't pierce into my heart like a thorn...
Falling like rain drops to touch you...
If it wants to shine...
Shall I gather the clouds and burn it down?
If parrots repeat your words...
Shall I bury it to go silent?
If flowers wish to touch you...
I'll cut down the garden...
If any eye dares see you, I'll pluck them out... 3 months rigorous imprisonment.
Life sentence
Break the car of the man who gave lift to her.
Will you break a car if anyone gives me lift?
Who do you think he is?
My house owner.
He'll ask me to vacate the flat, what has happened now?
Where am I to go?
Who is Geetha here?
- Me!
Come, I'll show you a house, madam.
- Who are you?
House broker, you called me for a house.
I didn't call you.
This is AJ office, right?
I got a call from here only.
You're wasting my time, don't you want a flat?
Wait.
- What happened?
- Will the flat be good?
Very good, if you want call the owner.
Come in madam.
This is your flat.
This is hall, bedroom is on right..
- l'll tell you.
This is bedroom.
To sleep and take rest.
This is kitchen.
This is dining table.
Cook there and eat here.
This is store room.
Owners are in foreign and their things are in it.
This is sofa and that's TV.
Did you see how I found it?
I'm like that, I'll see the flat and tell the flashback.
I like it.
Your cell phone is saved.
Where's the match box?
Match box is in the cupboard.
Found the match box, where's the candle?
Candle is on the tea table.
Milk is boiling on the stove.
It means nothing had happened.
My mind sees things which didn't happen and doesn't see things happening, and flies away.
I'm not able to judge myself.
Sometimes I feel it's hallucination, sometimes not.
I feel you're here somewhere at times and not sometimes.
I feel you're watching me, that you're chasing me, not only that, I feel like you're here and watching me.
I feel like you're watching and smiling at me.
Will you have an egg?
Egg vanished!
Egg vanished!
Do you say Arya came to your home to steal an egg?
is Arya not in a situation to buy an egg?
We can't lodge a complaint with police about egg theft, right?
Only you know I smoke and drink.
I thought this is the safest place.
Very good boy!
You selected a perfect place.
I'll teach you a lesson.
No use in telling them, because nobody would believe it.
I'm myself confused if you're here or not.
How can they believe me?
Why did you stop?
Please have your drink.
Wine in one hand chicken in another and cigarette between fingers, look, how handsome you're like a bad boy.
Listen to me and settle with this image.
Perfect boy!
Do you want an omelette?
Omelette is ready boy.
Eat.
Mustn't do anything with Geetha I mustn't.
No, I'll clear it, you don't do it.
I'll clear it...okay?
Are you feeling sleepy, boy?
Come and sleep here.
Geetha, I want to talk to you.
Let's talk fresh tomorrow morning.
You go to sleep, my sweety.
He's still sleeping.
One... two... three...
Your Mr.Perfect's final episode, come and watch it.
What sir?
Till now she broke four phones, this is fifth phone, my wife's gift, moreover it's blackberry, keep it carefully.
Open sesame!
Hold it.
I put three locks.
Show ends and curtains down.
Come in.
Why did you stop?
Look at him clearly!
Your Mr. Perfect!
Are you feeling like seeing a never happened before thing?
I'm hallucinating, you must answer now.
Am I in love with Arya?
Am I creating all this because he's ignoring me?
Don't spend your life in dreams.
Egg vanished?
!
It didn't, had a full bottle and dozing.
Claims to have earned ten degrees.
Give me your cell.
Not to break it but to take photos.
I must show everyone in office.
Please don't disturb him.
This pose is very nice.
It's me Dasavatharam.
What is Geetha doing in your flat?
Why is Geetha in your flat?
This is Geetha's flat!
You are here!
Why are you here?
How can you be in Geetha's flat?
Do you've any common sense?
No dear, this is indeed your flat, this cell phone is mine, my pulse is racing,
Arya came to your flat, I'm telling that only, hey man, do you've sense?
Why did you come here?
Listen to me, please give it to me dear.
Gave it like that!
Come here, will anyone give the cell phone like that?
How was I?
How you've turned me?
Really you've made me a jerk.
Love?
is this love?
Would anyone in this world love like this?
No Geetha, the world knows me as a good boy only, I wanted to show only you my other bad side.
If you love me, I wanted you to love my bad too.
I really felt to be my true self before you.
Do you really love me?
Then, accept the truth before all.
Accept you did all this.
lmpossible.
If I'm proven bad, I must leave office and everyone there.
Then, do one thing, express your love for me before all, nobody will misunderstand us then
You accept first, then I'll express my love.
My best friend Ajay.
I swear on him.
What I say is truth.
I kissed Geetha in lift.
I wrote the love letter.
Not only that I smoke cigarettes.
I drink.
I don't have any vision problem.
I can see everything clearly.
I made Geetha to come to my flat.
Who sir?
- Me!
I feel like Arya is accepting the truth.
Arya is really accepting all his deeds.
Then you're also hallucinating.
Why I did all this because... I had to express my love for you to escape from him.
Anyway he hung his head in shame before everyone for me.
I felt pity on him.
Do you think he really loves me so much?
I don't know I'm confused.
First when I saw him I was impressed with his sincerity and perfection.
To tell you the truth, may be I would've loved him had he remained like that.
But he tortured me a lot.
Will he break car if anyone gives me lift?
If I say anything, he says it's love.
How am I to believe him?
Do you know why I feel his love may be true?
Seeing your friendship.
He loves you.
I told I love for that only.
If I tell that to anyone else, he'll harm them.
If it is you, he'll not harm you.
He may harm me also.
Because he knows I love you.
The same masked car hit Ajay which I told you about.
Isn't it him?
Isn't it him?
Leave it, nothing happened to me.
What if anything had happened?
- Nothing happened, right?
What if anything had happened?
To escape from you I told Ajay that I love him.
Isn't Ajay your best friend?
I thought you'll not harm him.
But you tried to kill him.
You don't know the value of friendship.
How can you know what is love?
I'm telling you now...
What will you do now?
Will you kill him?
Kill him.
Where are you going?
- Arya, stop...
- Let him go...
You don't know he's very sensitive.
How did it happen?
If you ask how it happened...
When you kissed Geetha, she came to me for solace, I pacified her, I always pacified her friendly, but she misunderstood me.
I'm not asking that but about the accident.
Accident?
I was parking the car...
parked the car, suddenly a car came from behind and hit me.
I almost got down from car after parking it.
But I couldn't see...
- Why didn't you tell me?
Didn't tell you...
I was thinking of calling you but...
But my phone got broken.
I wasn't conscious too.
Not that, why didn't you tell me about pacifying Geetha?
I thought of telling you but...
- Why didn't you tell me?
Situation didn't raise...
- Why didn't you tell me?
I mean...because....
l didn't tell you...
I didn't tell you wantonly.
Because I wanted you to hurt Geetha.
The day you kissed her, she came to me and cried.
I pacified her.
Everytime you hurt her, she came to me.
It means if Geetha has to come close to me, you must keep on hurting her.
that's why I didn't tell you.
I don't know if Geetha loves me or not, but she's angry on you, I wanted to turn that hatred into my love and I succeeded.
She said I love to me getting angry on you, I wanted to turn it real, so I created this accident, I proved that you don't value friendship too, she really expressed her love for me.
How can I agree if you spin a coin and claim Geetha?
It means you cheated me.
- Yes I cheated you.
I didn't get any doubt.
I'm shocked.
I too didn't get any doubt, you're great.
That's why you're number one.
Why didn't you tell me all these days?
Bloody idiot!
One minute.
Geetha expressed her love for you, did you express your love for her?
Didn't express?
Bloody, she may feel bad, express it right now.
Come.
One minute, put your hand into it, she may know the truth.
Geetha expressed love for you getting angry on me, if she comes to know about hand, what if she expresses her love to me getting angry on you?
So, for the present Geetha mustn't know this.
I'll not tell her, promise, you too don't tell her, promise.
Okay?
Come.
Anyway I'm a love failure, I'll be mock angry for few days.
Even I don't talk to you, you must come and talk to me.
If you say, why are you like that Arya?
I'll cool down, okay?
Come.
One minute.
Nothing, if you express your love to Geetha now, she'll become all yours, I can't have any feelings for her, so for one last minute I'll see her as my love.
Over.
Go and tell her.
When did it happen?
Which hospital?
What did the doctor say?
What has she done?
What happened?
Shanthi has committed suicide.
Doctors said they can say anything after 24 hours only.
She committed suicide hearing me saying I love you to Geetha.
How much she loved me?
Never once she expressed it to me.
How is Shanthi?
What's wrong with her?
She's doing fantastic!
Why did you tell last night that she had committed suicide?
What can I do?
I almost cried seeing you expressing love to Geetha.
If I cry at a friend's love success, it will be depressing, so I cried using Shanthi suicide as a ploy.
Even now I want to cry.
But I don't have a reason.
It'll be good if anyone commits suicide.
Okay, had enough of drinks, come.
- Go away...go!
What did I tell you?
I said I'll be angry and you must talk to me even if I don't.
Talk to me.
Okay, come then.
My best friend Ajay...
My lover Geetha...
Their love is grand success.
Gone...gone...my love is gone...
Let it go...
Gone...gone...the girl has gone...
Let her go...
Lights have gone...
story has changed...
It's darkness all the way...
Victory from life slipped out...
It left me alone...
Now it's fine...
Glass will break...
Chain will get snapped...
Rose will wither...
Let it go...
Pond will stay...
Beauty will diminish...
Man also dies...
Let love too go...
Successful lovers...
Those who married...
They remain in homes...
Those who love and fail in it rule the world...
And shine bright in history...
Go away from Geetha and Ajay
Do your work!
To hell with software!
For whom sir?
- Me!
Look at Arya!
Don't you feel he's drunk and stuttering?
What?
Don't you feel he's coming towards us?
I'm a fake and you're a fake.
I felt like he slapped me.
To hell with best employee award!
Must help Geetha and Ajay before I go.
What?
Marriage fixed suddenly?
I don't know, my father fixed it.
Your marriage is your wish, who is he to decide it?
He loves me very much.
If he loves you, will he force marriage on you?
Why are you shouting on me?
What can I do?
I don't have any problems like this.
Are you having a fight?
Will you split?
Have a cigarette, Ajay.
Smoke...oh no!
Geetha will get angry.
She may think I'm giving cigarettes and spoiling Ajay's health.
I'll go away.
What is Arya doing here?
Haven't you sent him out yet?
He's my friend, leave him
- Friend? He tried to kill you.
Do you still consider him as friend?
Shall we discuss about our problem?
No, my best friend and my best Geetha, marriage will happen if I come, if you don't come still it will.
My best friend and my best Geetha.
marriage will happen if I come, if you don't come still it will.
How would I know?
I agreed for this marriage, what's your problem?
Who is on line?
- Look, what a beautiful couple.
Who are you talking to?
- Your phone and your daddy.
Are you mad?
Do you know who my dad is?
- Please forgive me.
Are you from Rayalaseema?
Are you Raji Reddy's daughter?
Ajay, I'm scared, he's no ordinary factionist, I called him unnecessarily, Shanthi, you please tell her.
They will kill him and I can't live without him.
Hey you stop it!
Geetha, there's only one solution to it.
Tomorrow morning we are marrying.
Marrying?
Has Geetha come?
- Not yet sir.
Still last night's hangover isn't gone.
Hey tuft!
Move!
Who is he?
What happened?
- Geetha hasn't come yet.
Why?
Not interested?
Where are you?
Marriage time is almost...
Marriage time?
You know where l'm?
Rayalaseema.
My people brought me here overnight.
I don't know what to do, Ajay?
I'm sacred.
I'm coming, grandma.
Where are you going?
- To Kurnool.
Kurnool?
Why?
- To bring back Geetha.
Are you mad?
Rayalaseema!
They'll kill you.
Let them kill me, I can't live without Geetha.
You don't say like that, I can't live without you.
I'll not let you go.
- What am I to do?
They took her away because of you.
Who will bring her back?
Will you go?
ldea is good, I'll go and bring her back.
No need, already you've done much.
You said they took her away because of me.
I'll go there, stop that marriage and bring her back.
No need. I'll go myself.
Heads, you win and I must go.
It's very danger for you there, this bag is for me and this peg is for you.
I'll bring back Geetha.
You're not playing any drama to pack me off, are you?
Even if you do, I don't mind.
You're my friend, I'll believe you.
Are you Arya?
- Yes.
Geetha madam sent me for you, come.
Don't get scared, they are checking if bombs will blast or not.
Pick up that bag, I don't have a hand, please.
What happened to your hand?
My friend tried to stop a marriage, they cut my hand because I'm his friend.
What about your friend?
- They took his head.
That fresh grave is his.
Pour it.
I'm scared about his reaction for madam's friendship with men, talk to him carefully.
Stop!
Who is he?
Junior madam's friend, he's coming from city.
Why are you staring at him?
He came to attend her marriage.
Give us way.
Sir!
- l cut your hand but still haven't got sense.
Why did you bring a mischievous boy with you?
As far as I know madam doesn't have any friends.
Your native place?
Hyderabad.
- They both work in the same office.
Send the boy here.
Be careful.
Go, boss is calling you.
Sir, tell me to whom should I give after you're gone.
Tell Venkat Reddy that I told this, go.
Who are you?
Stop...stop....
listen to me.
After you do anything.
I said I'm Geetha's lover but didn't say Geetha too loves me.
Leave him.
Yes sir, I love Geetha but she never loved me.
I agreed bravely that I love Geetha because of you sir.
She told great about you sir, that you're marrying her to your enemy Kasi Reddy's son, and two faction families are uniting with this marriage, and that your decision will stop the blood bath in this region,
she told me great about you sir.
You're making an enemy your relative, I couldn't dare lie to you, that's why I told you the truth.
But your people could've beheaded me in seconds.
Why are you talking too much?
- Stop!
Let him talk.
- This is your brashness.
Sickles and bombs are still here.
Men are like that only.
How can you bring peace?
They tried to kill me misunderstanding my one word.
You've enmity for generations now, even if there's a small misunderstanding, entire marriage will turn into battlefield.
I came here to attend marriage but now I know, this marriage will not happen.
I told you earlier too this marriage will not happen.
How can we give our daughter to our enemy in marriage?
You carry on.
If you forgive me, I'll take leave now.
Stop!
We got furious hearing that you're junior madam's lover, but we are not angry now.
See, drop the weapons.
We've changed.
- No, you can't change.
We've changed, tell him boys.
- We've changed.
Brother!
Kasi Reddy's men are coming!
Indeed you've changed completely brothers.
Yes, he's right.
These sickles and bombs will be with us only, and we'll be like this only, this marriage will not happen till we are like this.
Whatever you say they are our enemies, sir, can't trust them.
No, this marriage must go with trust, they must trust us and we must trust them, drop your weapons first.
Not a sickle or bomb must be there in my house.
No sir...
- Follow my order.
- Throw it.
Why are you laughing?
Do you think this marriage will not happen?
It will happen.
Stay here and watch how it happens.
He's our guest, take his luggage.
- Yes boss.
I wanted to kill men here but now I'm getting welcomed by them.
Whatever it is, we must be careful from our side.
- Okay boss.
We trust them, but do they trust us?
We must trust them and they must trust us, you told us.
Trust?
Sickle...sickle...
They really trust you very much.
- What is this Kasi Reddy?
Are you surprized seeing us with weapons in marriage?
To give it up at your feet.
From today we are not enemies, give up your weapons boys.
Brother-in-law...no bombs, right?
All of you hug each other.
This isn't like happy hug but security check.
Enough of squeezing it, leave it.
What are you doing?
We've reached.
Looking after us well...
Got scared?
Hot water is ready for bath, come.
I didn't get scared, you got scared and scared me.
Fools!
We mustn't get scared.
We are grooms' side.
This is black berry tree but it's known as Geetha tree here, because she ate a berry and spit the seed here which grew up, take video.
- Move aside.
Geetha fell knocked down by this threshold.
Boss closed it because it made Geetha to fall down.
Take video.- ls it?
- Take...
- Get up.
I've been trying so much to make her fall, did you make Geetha fall when she was a little girl?
Bloody idiot!
To tell about this tub, when Geetha was little...
Get my bag, I'll go away.
If you go away, I'll lose my another hand too.
Boss wants him to stay here.
He'll not go.
Why is she calling me like a servant?
I came here to help and talk to me affectionately and get things done.
Tell her to call me affectionately.
Please madam, do it.
No feel in it. Look, how I call you.
There's feel in it.
- Did you see?
Try it.
Not good.
Keep on practicing.
You carry on.
Not that, tell about this.
Geetha used to take bath everyday in this tub only.
- Here?
As a little girl.
Why are you taking the video?
I'm not doing it on my own, Ajay asked me to do it.
Come.
There are many things of Geetha like cycle, vessels, etc.,
Tell me.
Tell me what's it?
Did you ask to take video of things connected with my childhood?
Take video?
Me?
I sent him to stop the marriage, what is he doing there?
Give the phone to him.
Geetha used to play mom and dad game as a child.
Geetha madam.
- With phone as a child too.
If I'm not wrong, Geetha would've broken this phone.
How do you know it?
Gold medal won as a kid?
It's not a gold medal but it's shy coin.
Go...go...
- No sir it is...
Shy coin!
Small bangles of Geetha as a toddler.
Small plait bells of Geetha as a little girl.
Small slippers of child Geetha...
Big foot!
Big eyes!
Big Geetha!
Ajay told me to film it.
Ajay didn't ask you to film it.
I know it.
He doesn't love me so much.
- No, he loves you very much.
If he did, he would've come, why would he send you?
If he doesn't come it means he doesn't love you.
Do you know how much he loves you?
Do you know it?
- l know.
As much as anger you felt on seeing me for the first time...
As much as hatred you had when I talked to you first time...
As sinful as I kissed you first time...
As much of relief as you felt when I told you the truth...
No...
As much as light spreads early morning in the village...
As much as the milk foam sticking to the calf's mouth...
As delicious as eating a local delight...
As desirous as a young girl wishing for marriage...
As lovely as the rap of a mother when you're mischievous...
As much as the flowers blooming to spread colour...
As much fear as a poor dull student facing exams...
As brave as a heroic warrior facing the might of an army...
As lively as a standing crop...
As passionate as Ghantasala's songs...
As mouth watering as the delicacies during festivals...
As deep as the sleep of Kumbhakarna...
As long as Lord Hanuman's life...
As much as the black Lord Krishna...
As much as his chant...
As bitter as neem...
As troublesome as the village settlement place...
As confusing as the holy Veda...
As beautiful as the moon's reflection in the pond...
As festive as the yearly festival...
As thunderous as in an open air theatre...
Get up...get up...
What are you doing?
- Geetha has come.
Do you've any idea of stopping this marriage?
Are you playing here with dog while arrangements are going on there?
Will this dog stop this marriage?
He's Sathi Reddy, my...
- l know him, he killed my Veera Reddy.
How are you doing?
Hadn't we become kinsmen, I would've killed him first.
Take a photo.
Geetha is coming.
Sister-in-law is coming.
Ajay's love...
Ajay's love...
They trust you very much, brother.
Not trust, they wet pants on seeing us.
Bloody cover up.
Stop!
Don't eat!
Brother, those bastards poisoned the food.
The dog died.
Where is Raji Reddy?
Get him.
Ask him to come here.
What happened Kasi Reddy?
Have you lost the courage to face us?
Will you poison food to kill us?
Look, the dog died.
No, we didn't do anything.
We didn't poison the food.
Stop your drama, I thought your compromise was genuine.
I didn't expect you'll backstab us.
You ruined our honour.
What a lousy life is yours!
Kasi Reddy, you're crossing the limit, I killed 20 people in one shot,
I don't need to kill anyone with poison, if there had been any lapse, I'm ready to sacrifice my life first.
tell me what do you want me to do?
I'll tell you, bring the food eaten by dog.
Eat...it's not poisoned, right?
Eat!
Stop sir...how can you eat dog's leftover?
No, if I don't eat it's like proving their accusation right.
I don't want to be blamed for poisoning guests unable to face them.
Do you trust me now?
- How did the dog die then?
Where is the dog?
- lt left long back, boss.
Bloody idiot!
I trust you, dog is alive and you're alive, trust is more important, we are ready for the marriage.
Priest, chant the hymns.
Marriage band, carry on playing.
Come boys, let's eat.
No Kasi Reddy, this marriage will not happen.
I thought you came trusting me, I didn't think you'd come with mistrust, even in the last moment, I expected to hear you say, I trust you.
My daughter will not be happy where there is mistrust.
Go away...go away... I didn't come to you seeking peace.
My son liked your daughter, so I agreed for this marriage.
but I expected something will go wrong,
That's why I've come ready.
Father!
I want Geetha.
Bring her.
Let peace prevail!
Father, keep the knife away.
Father...
- Take her inside.
He's trouble, keep him away.
How can she come without brandishing a knife?
How can you marry her?
Go!
Father...
I can't stand him.
Put him in that vehicle, go.
Get that fool into the vehicle.
What ever it may be, you made him eat dog's leftover food.
I wished to brandish a knife at Raji Reddy.
It got fulfilled today. I wish someone had taken a photo of it.
Boss, the city boy was taking photos.
I saw him.- ls it?
Catch it.
I'll make a big cut out of it and hang it in my hall.
Why?
Why did you get into this bus?
Get down.
I'm asking you to get down but you're turning back to see.
Get down!
Get down!
Kill him boys!
Bloody idiots!
Where's my wife?
Raji Reddy!
Are you happy that your daughter returned home?
Even now I won.
Because your honour has gone to the dogs.
How shameful if Raji Reddy's daughter's marriage cancels at last moment?
Were you watching fun when they took away my wife?
I'll kill anyone who marries her.
Bloody bastard!
I would've saved her if I had been there.
Bloody!
Beat me with slipper if you don't marry her.
Your daughter will live if she becomes my daughter-in-law, or else she'll become a widow.
Always a widow!
You talked about peace and staked your daughter's life.
I warned you against this marriage.
You never listened to me.
My grand daughter said she'll marry any dog also other than him.
Yes father, I said no because they are our enemies.
You don't feel sad, father.
Tell me now, I'll do whatever you ask me to do.
They will not do anything, sir.
Bloody cowards!
Next time I'll cut them into pieces.
There's only one way, the marriage must go on as scheduled.
Say yes boss, there are many ready to marry her.
Grandma.
Ram Reddy's son is working in Hyderabad.
He earns Rs.1 lakh a month.
He came to attend marriage.
Venkat Reddy's son...
Mal Reddy's son is also...
Anji Reddy's son...
Come here!
Will you marry my daughter?
I will sir.
Take yellow rice.
Geetha is married.
Bloody fool!
Marriage is over, what are you doing here?
Watching her photo!
I want Geetha!
- Are you mad.
- l want Geetha!
Want Geetha!
How to kidnap her from home?
Son...son...
- What happened mother?
Geetha is missing.
I searched everywhere.
Sir!
Ajay, listen to me.
- What will you say?
What did you say and what have you done?
You promised to bring Geetha but married her.
Please listen to me, one minute.
Leave me.
I married Geetha wantonly.
Else your father-in-law would've got her married to some other man.
Moreover she promised to marry even a dog.
I've become that dog.
Since I married her, I could bring her to you.
Otherwise she would've been in her in-laws place.
You beat me unnecessarily.
Okay, first you go away from here.
Dangerous to be here.
Don't stay in India, go to US.
Your passports and tickets are ready.
As soon as you reach Hyderabad, catch a flight to US.
Stay there for few days and dust will settle down here.
I'll manage everything here.
You get the bag.
I misunderstood you.
That's okay, we can talk later, first leave this place.
Dangerous to be here.
Go!
Not behind, this side.
Quick!
Dear, Geetha is missing.
Don't know where she has gone?
If you know anything, your father-in-law wants you to call this number.
Father-in-law, Geetha is in railway station.
Stop...stop...
Stop it!
Stop!
What are you doing?
Are you mad?
Who do you think he is?
He's my friend Ajay.
He informed about Geetha, won't you bother to know details?
What?
Father-in-law, he's my friend Ajay.
He informed you about Geetha's whereabouts.
He heard about my sudden marriage and came to meet me.
Few moments late it would've been disaster.
Forgive me sir, I found them close and misunderstood it.
I told him to talk to her till you come here.
What's this Tikki Reddy?
Sorry Ajay.
Forgive us. lt was our mistake.
We lost control not finding her.
Did you see how many problems we had to face because of you?
Father-in-law, what could she do?
You didn't ask her opinion before fixing marriage.
May be that's why she left unable to adjust.
Nothing to worry, she'll adjust as times passes.
Will you?
Let bygones be bygones, you tasted our anger, come to my home, you can enjoy our hospitality too.
Yes, father-in-law is very good man.
They respect guests, you'll see it.
Did you see sir?
How he supports our madam?
My son-in-law is gold.
Thank God you came on time, I'm totally confused.
If you hadn't come on time...
How did they know we were in railway station?
I told them.
Be careful!
I could sacrifice lover easily but couldn't sacrifice wife so easily.
I couldn't bear losing Geetha, in that confusion, I called father-in-law and informed him.
Sorry, it'll never happen again.
Thank God, you agreed.
That's enough for me.
Our plan is wrong.
If Geetha leaves alone, father-in-law will get doubt, he'll then...
He'll catch you easily.
If we three go to Hyderabad, if you both fly to US from there, nobody would get any doubt.
This is correct for now, trust me.
Why are you still here?
Get ready quickly for the ring game.
I'm coming grandma.
Who is he?
- My best friend, grandma.
Be careful sunny!
Don't trust friends, they'll cheat you.
Okay granny.
About me.
They want me to play ring game, can I play?
No, then leave it.
Anyway I'm leaving Geetha to you, I'll play just few games.
Are you feeling bad?
If you feel I'll not play.
Friendship is important, no need of all that.
I'm going to feel all my life, what's wrong if you feel for one day?
Ajay is my friend...
Feeling for one day is also feeling.
I managed to stop marriage, this is nothing.
Son-in-law, everything is ready, you must come now.
I'm coming.
Come...
Look dear and you too, I'm going to put this ring into the vessel, whoever takes it out will rule the roost.
Play dear...it's wrong...
come on play dear...
Why are you adamant like a little girl?
Father-in-law, you don't worry, give me your phone.
If you overact they may get doubt. They will kill Ajay.
Then you may have to live with me all your life. Play!
Priest, everything is ready.
Start the game.
Start!
But on one condition, play with smile. Okay?
Son-in-law is magician, he made madam smile so easily.
Don't laugh so much, Ajay may feel bad.
Go and tell him. Go!
Two loads to Basava Reddy in Kurnool, four loads to Muni Reddy of Bagampalli, ten loads to Veera Reddy...
- Father-in-law.
We are going to Hyderabad.
We have plenty of work in office.
Where will you go?
Tonight is your first night.
One minute, father-in-law.
Say now, father-in-law.
What's this son-in-law wants go?
How can he go?
Tonight his first night.
Please advice him, he'll listen to you.
Correct, father-in-law, you found it right, I'll listen to him only.
Isn't it?
If he sees it means okay, I'm his friend I know it, father-in-law.
We'll stay back, father-in-law.
Come here!
Planned anything to spoil first night?
- No.
No?
I told you to plan something.
Ever since marriage I'm desiring Geetha, I'm scared of betraying you.
I feel like giving up Geetha for you and also take away from you.
I'm confused. I'm confused.
Come here.
Come here I say!
Take it.
What would you do if you were in my place?
I would sacrifice Geetha.
- Then do it.
Why am I behaving so selfish?
Ajay is my friend...
No, our friendship is great.
No, I'll sacrifice.
Say something about friendship and inspire me.
You mean what?
Tell me everything you did for me since our childhood.
Tell me...tell me...
As a child I gave you pencil.
Later you gave me pen also, not such things.
I asked for childhood memories and you're talking about trivial things.
Tell me something else.
I came to station and bailed you out.
I went to the police station for you only.
Not that, say something else.
I offered you a job in my company.
I own that company, not that, say something else.
Tell me quickly, try to recollect and tell me.
Say something.
It means you haven't done anything for me till now.
It means I too needn't do anything for you.
So I needn't sacrifice Geetha for you.
Needn't sacrifice Geetha for you!
Needn't sacrifice Geetha for you!
Father-in-law!
I'm a foreigner, I came from foreign...
For proud young men, I left Washington...
Got fed up boarding airbus...
I started liking red bus...
I reached red fort and waited for him...
For whom?
I got fed up kissing clean shaven men...
I searched for young men with big moustaches...
I visited Bangalore, Mangalore, Bihar, Jaipur...
But settled down in Rayalaseema...
What did those men do with you?
They blasted my beauty with a Cuddapah bomb...
They broke open the fencing of virginity with sharp sickles...
O white maiden!
That's all okay, but what's this ringa ringa?
The real game is my original name...
Unable to spell it correctly, they called me fondly as...
They stripped me off jeans and made me wear half sari...
And made a big plait beautifully...
I was like a stone, they turned me into a centre of pleasure...
They changed my English funnily...
They entered my home from backdoor fiercely...
They took my life without killing me...
They devoured my beauty...
They took away all my shyness...
Did they took away?
What else did they do?
They followed me like a birth mole...
They gave me new touches...
They fulfilled all my desires...
They taught me to walk like queen...
Hey girl!
How is our hero's power?
Young men in dhotis have shown me the best...
I liked the men who pull out arrack...
Tasteless pizza is useless...
Local food with onions is delicious...
I informed everyone about it on phone...
Did you tell?
Big star hotels are boring...
Roadside tea stalls are great fun...
Hearing this girls from Ireland, Greenland,
New Zealand, Netherlands, Thailand, Finland landed here....
Landed here?
What should we do now?
Put hand over hand and dial the land line...
I'll put hand over hand and dial the land line...
Do you want to kill yourself for not helping me?
Please don't jump, Ajay.
Please stop...don't jump.
0lf you jump, I'll not save you. I'll let you die.
I've changed.
You don't know to swim also, foolish fellow.
You'll die instantly.
We are leaving to Hyderabad tomorrow morning.
No, I'll not come, if I come you'll take away my Geetha.
No need.
- No, don't jump.
Heads or tails?
- Tail.
Don't put useless conditions like you win I win and I win you win.
Whoever wins, it's theirs.
Heads.
Okay, we are going to Hyderabad tomorrow.
- Why?
You won the toss.
I'll not change promises like you.
What you win is mine and what I win is yours.
Geetha is yours.
I asked you what did you do for me?
You're my friend, do you've to do something for me?
Had you told me you were my friend?
That would've been enough.
Must handover Geetha to Ajay.
Bloody lovelorn son!
My daughter-in-law is boarding train in station, go and abduct her.
Will not spare him today.
He took away my wife.
They have just reached the station, sir.
May you be blessed a long life with your husband.
Be careful dear.
Just a minute.
Tie this to your husband.
Why?
- According to your horoscope, your husband will die young.
To ward off that defect.
Tie it.
Don't disappoint her, tie it.
It won't be nice.
You're not my husband.
It won't affect you.
Granny, I asked and she promised to tie in train.
You don't mind it.
Don't feel sad, Geetha will definitely love you, because wife must love her husband, that's the wonder of marriage.
How can she love now which she didn't all these days?
Mad boy!
You don't need years to sprout love.
Just a moment is enough.
You must wait for that moment.
That's all.
Be careful.
- Bye granny.
- Bye.
Sir, your fish.
Be careful.
- Bye.
How could I forget you gold fish?
Hey Tikki Reddy!
Where is Ajay?
- He'll come, you go.
Father-in-law!
- You forgot your book.
Over, it's all over!
He'll kill...my father will kill Ajay.
My father will do anything for honour.
You were waiting to kill Ajay, you will kill him.
You tried to kill him in an accident.
Now you wantonly left behind that book.
Wantonly!
I'm getting you now.
If Ajay dies, no more hurdles.
We can live happily together.
Isn't that your intention?
Isn't she sad there?
Why are you disturbing her?
Don't you've common sense?
You carry on Geetha, carry on.
- Are you mad?
Why are you feeling for Ajay more than me?
You're just a lover, do you know what he's to me?
Friend, my blood friend.
If you're so sad for your lover, how sad should I be for my friend?
Train has left, brother.
Pull the chain after the second bridge, we'll bump him off.
Okay brother.
I didn't expect this, I'm worried about Ajay.
They will kill him.
Will they kill him?
Even if they think of killing Ajay, I'll kill them.
Whatever it may be, my daughter-in-law will come home today.
Turn my neck.
Who has come?
Who has come?
- That comb boy!
Stop!
Stop!
If I had come here it means I've something for you.
What's that?
Didn't I tell you my daughter-in-law will come home?
You want Raji Reddy's daughter, right?
Take her.
I don't need her.
Keep her with you.
My father-in-law has kidnapped Ajay, till he releases Ajay, you don't release Geetha.
Till then keep her with you.
Hey stop...stop...
Ajay?
Why should I release her?
I didn't get you.
- You don't know Ajay, right?
Geetha's lover.
Not Geetha's lover, he's my blood friend first.
Then Geetha's lover.
Father-in-law has kidnapped him.
Unless he releases Ajay, you mustn't release Geetha.
If he refuses, you must also refuse.
Till then keep her with you, let me see what he can do.
Son-in-law has joined us.
Hey stop...stop...
I've a doubt.
- What?
Can't you threaten your father-in-law keeping Geetha with you?
That one, I thought something else.
I love Geetha and father-in-law knows I won't harm her.
If she's with you, father-in-law will fear you may harm her.
That's why I'm leaving her with you.
Stop...stop...you said another doubt, what is that?
Geetha is with you now.
You can do anything, even get her married to your son.
- Correct, I can do that.
But you can't.
- Why not?
For that you must have your son.
I do have. - No.
He's with me.
- My... lf Geetha has to be safe with you, your son must be safe with me.
True boss, our men are going in an ambulance to hospital.
To Kurnool.
- To Kurnool...
Tomorrow morning exchange in Dayyaladibba, call my father-in-law, ask him to come with Ajay, call me and ask me to come with your son.
Should I cal you both?
- Yes.
But one condition, father-in-law mustn't come there, because I can't show him my face, I can't face him.
Why are you staring at me?
I don't need you, I need you only if he's there.
If he's not there, I don't need you.
Look, your father is very dangerous man.
He'll take lives for honour.
If anything happens to my Ajay, your son will die.
He risked wife's life for a friend, I like his character.
If he can put wife's life in risk, how much risk he'll take with my son?
I did all this for my friend.
You don't take it personal.
Do you drink?
Love failure, I'm sure you will.
Yours is faction family, how could you fall in love with Geetha amidst so much violence?
Where is he?
How do you feel now?
I feeling like I'm dying.
- l too felt the same.
I felt I may die if I don't love Geetha.
He's my type.
We are same. Lovers batch.
Can one Geetha's lover kill another Geetha's lover?
You left me as soon as I told I'm Geetha's lover.
Your love is true.
What's this twist?
Father said I'm mad, everyone said I'm mad.
But only you told mine is love.
Once more please.
- Subbi, your love is true.
Can I tell you my love story?
- Geetha's love story, carry on.
I was nineteen then...
What?
Did you see Geetha in long skirt?
10 years ago!
Then you're very senior.
You're elder brother and I'm younger brother.
No, you're elder brother and I'm younger brother.
You're elder brother and I'm younger brother.
No, it's swear on Geetha.
Brother.
We mustn't leave her, brother.
We must love Geetha so much that we must sacrifice her also.
Sacrifice means?
- Sacrifice means forfeit.
If you do...
- Will Geetha be happy?
Happy means...
- l know what is happy.
Happy of happy birthday, right?
- You know a lot of things.
That's why let's give up Geetha to Ajay.
Who is Ajay?
Are you asking who is Ajay?
Ajay is my blood friend.
His love is greater than your love, you know that?
I mean not greater than your love.
Geetha loves him, so he's great.
- Geetha loves him?
I fell for him, Geetha is nothing.
Come here.
He cheated me, his best friend for Geetha, that's why he's great.
Cheating?
- Cheating means not exactly cheating, poor boy, whom did he fall in love with?
My lover!
And who Geetha loves...?
My friend!
Nobody is wrong but all of them together... I...
I disturb everyone.
We'll never let this friendship break...
We'll rather die than break up with him...
Brother!
The best thing you like in Geetha.
Her eyes!
- ls it?
I too like Geetha's eyes only.
Go back...
Brother...brother...stop...stop...
What are you doing?
Listen to me.
Why are you hurting yourself?
What happened to you?
For build up, my dad should know you'd beaten me, right?
Brother, you're upstaging me.
You're feeling giddy....
are you okay?
Be careful.
- Come!
Did you bring knife, brother?
- No brother, I forgot.
That's too much.
My son!
Kasi Reddy, here's your son!
Tell him to release my friend, else I'll kill your son.
Wait...wait...don't harm my son.
My clan's first original lover!
Please....please...
I'll free your friend.
Where is the girl?
Come here!
I'll free him if you free our madam.
Free him or else I'll cut her throat.
Cut?
Let me see your courage, do it.
Brother, he's my best friend Ajay, isn't he very handsome?
If you've guts, do it.
He?
He's not that good!
Did Geetha fall in love with him?
I've started doubting Geetha's love.
I don't like him.
I'll not let him take my Geetha.
How dare you say that for my blood friend, brother?
Then I'll point a knife at you.
You're my friend and he's your friend, so, he too is my friend.
Threatening to kill her?
If I cut intestines will come out.
Do as you said.
- l can't, brother.
Do as I told you.
- We were brought up like that.
If you don't do, I swear on Geetha.
- Brother!
My son!
Brother, Subbi Reddy has escaped!
Father, I made it.
Come on boys!
Father, go.
Hold this, look after her.
Come!
Come fast!
Else...
Put the bag in quickly.
Go brother.
- Bye.
- Go. You go, I'll manage.
Be careful.
- Be careful.
Brother...be careful with our Geetha.
Okay, get going, go...go...
Why are you sending away my daughter-in-law?
Stop father.
What's all this?
Sacrifice.
- lt means?
Forfeit!
- Forfeit?
Arya
Got through the line, boss.
Look son-in-law, you're not taking my daughter, my family honour, you don't know about me, I trusted you and gave you my daughter, if there's any alteration in it, with the same hands that washed your feet,
I'll behead you.
Shanthi's phone.
Hi!
Passports and tickets.
Tomorrow evening flight at 7.30 pm.
Take your passports and tickets.
You've 24 hours before leaving to US, you must spend it here.
This is the safest place, okay?
But on one condition!
The next 24 hours...
You must be friendly with me.
Ever since this trouble started, you both haven't talked to me.
I'm confused.
I know once you go to US, you'll never meet me again.
You'll not let her meet me.
We are going to be together for 24 hours only.
Let's forget all these troubles and be friendly.
Hey!
Won't you?
If you don't, I'll inform father-i-law!
Inform him.
- lnform him.
Look, I'll surely inform father-in-law.
That's not the number.
Come on talk to him.
Phone is ringing, definitely I'll tell him.
Phone is ringing, I'll tell him.
Aren't you able to tell him?
Hello father...
Are you mad?
Why is she spoiling the entire plan?
Do you know how much trouble her father can create if he knows?
How can you live with her alone in US?
She has many tricks.
Before these moments die, spend life happily...
Make it cherished and memorable...
Eyes have become seas...
Waves of memories are hitting the shores...
Dropping down from eyes like tears...
Every passing minute is wounding...
Every wound has become a goal...
Those goals have become milestones of my love...
I'm a river that got tired running long distance...
Meandering into dusty sands without reaching any seashore...
I'm a dream that walked out of the eye...
I don't belong to any of the two eyes...
Has my love turned into friendship?
Has my life become an unanswered question?
Is there any name for this relationship?
If it is there, is there any possibility to separate it?
Hey give the phone...
- Wait a minute...
Who do you think he is?
My husband!
If anyone hurts me, he'll kill you.
- Is it?
...you...
What is it?
Before you both fly to US, change garlands as I watch.
Please don't ask me why.
I must get the feeling that you both are united.
Please, do this for me.
- Okay, do as you say.
Then I'll arrange for your marriage in temple at 9 am.
Okay?
Do you believe him?
9 am in temple?
It seems he wants to see us marry.
He has started another drama, I don't believe him.
That's why I changed the plan, we are going to Australia not US.
Not tomorrow evening, tomorrow morning.
How can you cheat your friend?
- Look, he was never my friend.
I'm friendly with him so that he won't harm us till we go from here.
And till we reach Australia....
Must make Geetha fondly call my name Arya.
Why haven't you packed yet?
Didn't I tell you we are leaving by morning?
We'll not have time to pack in the morning.
We must leave silently, he mustn't even get slightest doubt.
He's too smart.
Okay sleep now, don't set alarm, he may get up for that, I'll come and wake you up.
I think it's better if we tell Arya and leave.
No need.
What's all this?
How can Ajay smoke without me?
He'll smoke only when I smoke half of it.
I thought he may face problem in Australia, so...
So all this.
Do you know we are going to Australia?
I know.
Without my knowledge, you can't even take a breath.
May be you both are right, because sadness will be only once for anything, but two sad things are happening to me at a time,
You're leaving and he too is leaving me.
I may do anything to stop you unable to bear this sadness.
Call father-in-law, or do anything.
So, to keep myself doing anything to you,
What's that?
Don't worry, just a small dose.
When you leave tomorrow morning, to stop me from awakening.
Give this gift to Ajay.
Why are you staring at me?
For not giving you any gift?
Auspicious thread on your neck is my gift to you.
Because when I was tying the knot, I remembered Ajay.
That's why I couldn't tie three knots.
If tying three knots completes our marriage, then we are not married at all.
What will you do after we go away?
What will I do?
You never thought of me as your lover.
He too never thought of me as a friend.
But father-in-law thought of me as son-in-law instantly.
I betrayed him.
I'll go to him.
Whatever he wants to do, I'll leave it to him.
My father will kill you.
Let him kill.
If he's so angry to kill me.
I've so much love to die.
Okay, we are getting late.
Arya!
Did I call fondly?
No, but you felt like calling.
That's enough!
Can I ask you something?
Were you really friendly with me?
Or did you act like Ajay?
Can I ask you something?
You love Ajay so much, how could you do that accident?
What is this?
- Arya gave it.
- Arya?
Does he know we are going?
- He knows.
I'm sure he'll inform your father.
Let's go immediately.
This place is no more safe.
No, he'll not inform.
Why not?
He already did once, have you forgotten it?
We are still here because he told your father.
Come.
I know he'll not tell.
How knows him better, you or me?
I know him from childhood.
You know him but haven't understood him.
He loves you and me.
He's struggling between us.
Forget about him, first...
They have come, you said he'll not but I said he will.
He told him.
- He will not.
If not how could your father know it.
I told him.
Yes, I called him here.
We can be happy if we go away now.
After that my father will kill Arya.
Why should Arya die for our love?
This is our problem and we must solve it ourselves.
Get in first.
Are you mad?
Why don't you get in?
They don't talk, they only kill, come.
Let him kill, if he's so angry to kill, I've so much love to die.
Do you've it?
- We must be alive for that.
Father, please don't harm Ajay.
I called you here because Ajay...
Father...
Father...
Father!
Please father, leave Ajay.
Father!
Please father!
No father!
Raji Reddy!
He's my friend, he's my life.
If you harm him, I'll kill everyone here.
Will you kill me?
Kill me...kill me...
why don't you understand him?
Because he's not a man but an idiot.
He is...
- Wrong.
Why are you abusing him?
Who do you think he is?
Father-in-law...
God!
What did he do wrong?
Any father would do like this for his daughter.
Father-in-law, I'm sorry, Ajay is very good man.
But he can't talk properly.
Say sorry to him.
Please listen to me once.
For begetting such a sinful daughter.
Father-in-law!
Geetha is my wife, you don't have any right to beat her.
She's not to be faulted, it's all my fault.
I'm responsible for everything.
Yes, you're responsible for everything.
My mistake was trusting and giving my daughter in marriage to you.
You betrayed my trust.
Please sir, don't beat him, he's our son-in-law.
He may die, sir.
Please listen to me.
Beat me...beat me...
kill me, father-in-law.
Atleast the Geetha and Ajay will live happily.
Kill me, father-in-law!
Father!
I called you here thinking you'll understand me.
Not to kill him.
Nobody must hurt anyone here.
If anyone hurts anybody...
Are you mad?
What's this?
What's this madam?
Boss agreed for that marriage for you.
He ate dog's leftover food also for you.
Everything is over, there's only one way out.
If you harm Ajay, Geetha will die.
No, he must die if Geetha wants to live happily.
Father-in-law, tell him, if he harms Ajay, I'll kill Geetha.
Kill her...kill her...
You can't kill her because you love her.
Yes I love Geetha, father-in-law.
I can't kill Geetha.
But I can kill myself, father-in-law.
I'll kill myself.
Stop...stop...
Leave him.
He may kill himself really, he's mad man.
He'll do anything for anyone.
He wants everyone and wants everyone to be fine.
Leave him.
Arya, stay like that, don't remove the knife, we'll go away.
Stay like that till we go away.
Come Geetha, let's go, we are getting late to our flight.
We can't manage them, he'll take care of them, let's go.
Look at him!
Your friend!
Were you doing all this for him?
For him?
No father-in-law, Geetha loves Ajay, so let her go with him.
Please father-in-law.
He's not right man.
He wasn't right when he sent you to stop the marriage, he isn't right now when he wants to escape putting your life in danger, he can never be right.
- What not right?
When he's accepting, what's your problem?
is it worrying you that she's already married?
is it marriage if you force it against her wish?
Can I marry her if I snap it?
This is root cause of all problems.
Remove it, Geetha.
Now you called me with love.
Just a minute!
What I'd wished never to happen, it did happen.
First time I'm seeing love in Geetha's eyes.
How much she's yearning for him!
I never this when she was with me.
Right, you don't need years to sprout love.
Just a moment is enough.
Arya's relative?
Haven't you yet gone to Australia?
How can we go?
No, Geetha will not come.
Everything is over, she's crying for you out there.
Look!
What are you planning to do?
What option do I've now?
Sacrifice!
If I don't do it now, I'll become a villain.
This time your father-in-law will not miss, he'll stab correctly.
Not that...
- You're not able to understand.
Geetha has changed...changed.
You not only changed Geetha, you've changed me too.
I know you love me.
But didn't know you can give life too for it.
Will you die for me?
First time...
I feel you're my friend.
But I know love isn't greater than our friendship.
Because Geetha loved me getting angry on you.
Now Geetha is not angry on you.
It means she doesn't love me anymore.
Now Geetha is yours, but she's not coming out.
If it has to happen, Geetha must get angry on me.
That's why I'm thinking of telling the truth.
What truth?
About that accident, I'll tell her it was me not you who did it.
No, you promised to keep it a secret.
What do you want me to do now?
Write in the diary what I say.
Must say sorry to Ajay.
To me?
Why?
What happened?
Want me switch it on?
Which switch?
Switch off this?
Who switched off this button?
I mean...
Were you planning to kill him?
Sorry buddy!
We're here!
Time to muscle up.
Hello?
Who's there?
You scared me to death, you mangy thing.
I'm just looking for an old well.
Know it?
Not talking, huh?
Magic dowser, magic dowser, show me the well!
Get away from me!
Let me guess.
You're from Texas or Utah, someplace dried-out and barren, right?
I heard about water witching before, but it doesn't make sense.
- I mean, it's just an ordinary branch.
- It's a dowsing rod.
And I don't like being stalked, not by psycho nerds or their cats!
He's not really my cat.
He's kind of feral. You know, wild.
Of course, I do feed him every night, and sometimes he'll come to my window and bring me little dead things.
Look, I'm from Pontiac.
Michigan.
And if I'm a water witch, then where's the secret well?
You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it.
See?
It's supposed to be so deep, if you fell to the bottom and looked up, you'd see a sky full of stars in the middle of the day.
Surprised she let you move in.
My gramma, she owns the Pink Palace. Won't rent to people with kids.
What do you mean?
I'm not supposed to talk about it.
I'm Wybie.
Wybie Lovat.
- Wybie?
- Short for Wyborne.
Not my idea, of course.
What'd you get saddled with?
I wasn't saddled with anything.
It's Coraline.
- Caroline what?
- Coraline.
Coraline Jones.
It's not real scientific, but I heard an ordinary name like Caroline can lead people to have ordinary expectations about a person.
Wyborne!
I think I heard someone calling you, Wyborne.
- What?
I didn't hear anything.
- I definitely heard someone,
Why-Were-You-Born.
Wyborne!
- Grandma!
Well, great to meet a Michigan water witch, but I'd wear gloves next time.
- Why?
- 'Cause that dowsing rod of yours, it's poison oak.
I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom.
I would've died.
That's nice.
So, can I go out?
I think it's perfect weather for gardening.
No, Coraline.
Rain makes mud. Mud makes a mess.
But, Mom, I want stuff growing when my friends come to visit.
Isn't that why we moved here?
Something like that.
But then we had the accident.
- It wasn't my fault you hit that truck.
- I never said it was.
I can't believe it.
You and Dad get paid to write about plants, and you hate dirt.
Coraline, I don't have time for you right now, and you still have unpacking to do.
Lots of unpacking.
That sounds exciting!
Some kid left this on the front porch.
Hey, Jonesy.
Look what I found in Gramma's trunk.
Look familiar?
Wybie.
A little me?
That's weird.
What's his name, anyway?
Wybie.
And I'm way too old for dolls.
Hey, Dad.
How's the writing going?
Dad!
Hello, Coraline and Coraline doll.
Do you know where the garden tools are?
It's... It's pouring out there, isn't it?
- It's just raining.
- What'd the boss say?
"Don't even think about going out, Coraline Jones!"
Then you won't need the tools.
You know, this house is 150 years old.
- So?
- So explore it.
Go out and count all the doors and windows and write that down on...
List everything that's blue.
Just let me work.
No.
No, no, no.
No.
One boring blue boy in a painfully boring painting.
Four incredibly boring windows and no more doors.
All right, little me.
Where are you hiding?
Hey, Mom.
Where does this door go?
I'm really, really busy.
I think it's locked.
Please!
Will you stop pestering me if I do this for you?
Fine.
Bricks?
I don't get it.
They must've closed this off when they divided up the house.
You're kidding.
And why is the door so small?
We made a deal!
Zip it!
You didn't lock it.
Oh, my twitchy-witchy girl
I think you are so nice I give you bowls of porridge
And I give you bowls of ice cream
Why don't you ever cook, Mom?
Coraline, we've been through this before.
Your dad cooks, I clean, and you stay out of the way.
I swear I'll go food shopping soon as we finish the catalog.
Try some of the chard.
You need a vegetable.
It looks more like slime to me.
Well, it's slime or bedtime, fusspot.
Now what's it gonna be?
Think they're trying to poison me?
Don't forget about me, guys.
Okay?
Good night, little me.
Something smells good.
Mom?
What are you doing here in the middle of the night?
You're just in time for supper, dear.
You're not my mother.
My mother doesn't have...
Buttons?
Do you like them?
I'm your other mother, silly.
Now go tell your other father that supper's ready.
Well, go on.
He's in his study.
Hello?
Hello, Coraline.
Wanna hear my new song?
- My father can't play piano.
- No need to.
This piano plays me.
Making up a song about Coraline
She's a peach, she's a doll She's a pal of mine
She's as cute as a button in the eyes of everyone
Who ever laid their eyes on Coraline
When she comes around exploring Mom and I will never, ever make it boring
Our eyes will be on Coraline
I'm sorry, but she said to tell you the food's ready.
Who's starving?
Raise your hand.
We give our thanks and ask to bless our mother's golden chicken breast.
This chicken is good.
- Hungry, aren't you?
- Do you have any gravy?
- Well, here comes the gravy train.
Choo, choo!
Another roll?
Sweet peas?
Corn on the cob?
I'm real thirsty.
Of course.
Any requests?
Mango milkshake?
- Home?
- We've been waiting for you, Coraline.
- For me?
- Yep.
Wasn't the same here without you, kiddo.
I didn't know I had another mother.
Of course you do.
Everyone does.
- Really?
And soon as you're through eating, I thought we'd play a game.
You mean like hide-and-seek?
Perfect.
Hide-and-seek in the rain.
What rain?
- What about the mud?
- We love mud here.
Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies.
- It's great for poison oak.
- How'd you know I...
I... I'd love to play, but I better get home to my other mother.
But I'm your other mother.
I mean my other, other mother.
Mom number one?
I think I should get to bed.
Of course, sweetheart.
It's all made up.
- But...
- Come along, sleepyhead.
- Hello, Coraline.
Hello, hello, hello, hello.
- What's shaking, baby?
- Hello.
Hey.
How's it going, Loper?
Where's your swampers and chook?
Cripes almighty!
How are my best trolls?
I can't wait till summer.
You're both coming, right?
- We're already here, Coraline.
- Gone to Oregon.
The mud.
- See you soon.
- See you soon.
It's gone.
My poison oak!
It's gone!
It was incredibly real, Mom.
Only you weren't really you. You were my other mother.
Buttons for eyes, huh?
Coraline, you only dreamed you ate all that chicken.
Take your multivitamin at least.
You were in the dream, too, Dad.
You had wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey slippers.
Orange?
My monkey slippers are blue.
Can you get me some of that magic mud you were talking about?
Because I have a terrible case of writer's rash on my...
If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages edited, he better wrap them up ASAP.
Coraline, why don't you go visit downstairs?
I bet those actresses would love to hear your dream.
Miss Spink and Forcible?
But you said they're dingbats.
Bobinsky.
Bobinsky.
Bobinsky.
Hello?
I think our mail got mixed up.
Should I leave it outside, or...
Secret!
Famous jumping mouse circus not ready, little girl.
Circus?
I brought this for you.
New cheese samples.
Very clever using this mix-up to sneak my home and peek at mooshkas?
- Mooshkas?
- The mice!
Sorry.
I'm Coraline Jones.
And I am the Amazing Bobinsky.
But you call me Mr. B because amazing I already know that I am.
You see, Caroline, the problem is...
My new songs go oompah, oompah, but the jumping mice play only toodle-toot, like that.
Is nice but not so much amazing.
So now, I switch to stronger cheese and soon, watch out!
Here, have beet.
Make you strong.
Do svidaniya, Caroline.
Coraline.
Hey, Caroline!
Wait!
No!
The mice asked me to give you message.
The jumping mice?
They are saying do not go through little door.
Do you know such a thing?
The one behind the wallpaper?
But it's all bricked up.
So sorry.
Is nothing.
Sometimes the mice are little mixed-up.
They even get your name wrong, you know?
They call you Coraline instead of Caroline.
Not Caroline at all.
Maybe I work them too hard.
Cease your infernal yapping.
How nice to see you, Caroline.
Would you like to come in?
We're playing cards.
Still Coraline, Miss Spink.
Miriam!
Put the kettle on!
April, I think you're being followed.
It's the new neighbor, Miriam.
Caroline.
She'll be having the oolong tea.
No!
Oh, no, no.
I'm sure she'd prefer jasmine.
No, oolong.
Jasmine it is, then.
Come on, boys.
Are those dogs real?
Our sweet departed angels.
Couldn't bear to part with them, so we had them stuffed.
Now, there's Hamish the third...
Go on.
Have one.
It's hand-pulled taffy from Brighton.
Best in the world.
the third, the ninth, yes.
The fourth, I'm right.
And Jock Jr., Jock Sr., Jock the third, the fourth, and that's Jock's second cousin thrice removed.
I'll read them if you like.
- Read what?
- Your tea leaves, dear.
They'll tell me your future.
Drink up then.
Go on.
No, not all of it.
Not all of it. That's right.
Now hand it over.
Oh, Caroline.
Caroline, Caroline, Caroline.
You are in terrible danger.
Oh, give me that cup, April.
Your eyes are going.
My eyes?
You're blind as a bat.
Well, not to worry, child.
It's good news.
There's a tall, handsome beast in your future.
- A what?
- Miriam, really.
You're holding it wrong.
See?
Danger.
What do you see?
I see a very peculiar hand.
I see a giraffe.
Giraffes don't just fall from the sky, Miriam.
Oh, Lord.
Well, what should I do?
Never wear green in your dressing room.
Acquire a very tall stepladder.
And be very, very careful.
Now, was there something you came to tell us?
No.
I guess not.
Thanks for the tea, though.
Toodle-oo.
- Cheery-bye.
Do you have any nice queens for Mummy?
Danger?
Great!
The village stalker.
I wasn't stalking you.
We're hunting banana slugs.
What do you mean "we?"
Your cat's not wild.
He's a wuss puss.
What?
He hates to get his feet wet.
Jeez.
Wuss puss.
So, that doll.
Did you make it look like me?
Oh, no.
I found it that way.
It's older than Grandma.
Old as this house, probably.
Come on.
Blue hair, my swampers and raincoat?
Dang!
Check out Slugzilla.
You're just like them.
I meant my parents.
They don't listen to me either.
Uh-huh. You mind?
You know, I've never been inside the Pink Palace.
You're kidding.
Grandma'd kill me.
Thinks it's dangerous or something.
Dangerous?
- Well, she had a twin sister.
- So?
When they were kids, Grandma's sister disappeared.
She says she was stolen.
Stolen?
Well, what do you think?
I don't know.
Maybe she just ran away.
Wyborne!
- Look, I gotta go.
- Wait a minute.
- Welcome back, darling.
- Hi.
So thoughtful of you to send this nice cheddar, Coraline.
Cheddar?
The mice bait.
Would you go fetch your father?
I bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now.
You mean my other father.
Your better father, dear.
He's out in the garden.
But my parents don't have time to garden.
Go on.
Hey.
I love your garden!
Our garden, Coraline.
Stop tickling me!
Daughter in distress.
Tickle no more, you dragon snappers.
Well, she says it's time for dinner, breakfast, food.
Hop on, kiddo.
I wanna show you something.
I can't believe you did this.
Mother said you'd like it.
Boy, she knows you like the back of her hand.
Mmm. So good.
I love dinner-breakfast-food.
Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you to come see the jumping mice perform after dinner.
Really?
That know-it-all Wybie said it was all in Mr. B's head.
I knew he was wrong.
Well, everything's right in this world, kiddo.
Your father and I will clean up while you and your friend head upstairs.
My friend?
Great.
Another Wybie.
Hello, Why-Were-You-Born.
Hello!
I thought you'd like him more if he spoke a little less.
So I fixed him.
- So he can't talk at all?
- Nope.
I like it.
Now, run along, you two, and have fun.
You're awful cheerful considering you can't say anything.
It didn't hurt, did it, when she...
Cool!
Look at you!
Lady and gentleman, for to tickle your eyes and ears and making hearts to thump,
I, Sergei Alexander Bobinsky, am introducing my astoundishing,
stupendulous and amazing jumping mouse circus!
My name!
It's wonderful, Wybie.
That was great!
Very, very thank you, lady and gentleman.
We loved it, Mr. B. It was so...
So...
Amazing!
You are very welcome anytime you like.
You and also your good friend there.
Do svidaniya, Coraline.
There were garden squash like balloon animals and snapdragons.
Oh, and upstairs, I saw a real mouse circus.
Not pretend like the crazy man's in our house.
You sure you won't come?
Don't fret, Charlie.
They'll love the new catalog.
At least they'll love my chapters.
I did not call him crazy, Coraline.
He's drunk.
Well, I guess I'll see you around, you dizzy dreamer.
Dad!
I'm not five anymore.
My kingdom for a horse!
Put them back.
But, Mom, the whole school's gonna wear boring gray clothes.
No one will have these.
Put them back.
My other mother would get them.
Maybe she should buy all your clothes.
So what do you think is in the other apartment?
I don't know.
Not a family of Jones imposters.
- Then why'd you lock the door?
I found some rat crap, and I thought you'd feel safer.
They're jumping mice, Mom, and the dreams aren't dangerous.
They're the most fun I've had since we've moved here.
- Your school might be fun.
- With those stupid uniforms?
Right.
Had to give it a try.
How do you feel about a mustard, ketchup, salsa wrap for lunch?
Are you kidding me?
Had to go food shopping, anyway.
Dad's planning something special.
Grossgusting.
You wanna come along?
You can pick out something you like.
Oh.
Like the gloves.
Look, Coraline, if things go well today, I promise I'll make it up.
That's what you always say.
Won't be long.
But I might be.
I knew it was real.
Dearest Coraline,
Miss Spink and Miss Forcible have invited you downstairs after lunch.
I hope you like the new outfit I made you.
Love, Mother.
Wybie's got a cat like you at home.
Not the quiet Wybie.
The one that talks too much.
You must be the other cat.
No, I'm not the other anything.
I'm me.
I can see you don't have button eyes, but if you're the same cat, how can you talk?
I just can.
Cats don't talk at home.
- No?
- Nope.
Well, you're clearly the expert on these things.
After all, I'm just a big fat wuss puss.
Come back.
Please?
I'm sorry I called you that.
I really am.
How'd you get here?
I've been coming here for a while.
It's a game we play.
She hates cats and tries to keep me out, but she can't, of course.
I come and go as I please.
The other mother hates cats?
Not like any mother I've ever known.
What do you mean?
She's amazing.
You probably think this world is a dream come true, but you're wrong.
The other Wybie told me so.
That's nonsense.
He can't talk.
Perhaps not to you.
We cats, however, have far superior senses than humans, and can see and smell and...
I hear something.
Right over...
Hey, Wybie.
She's practically naked!
I'm known as the siren of all seven seas
The breaker of hearts by the bay
So if you go swimming With bowlegged women
I might steal your weak heart away
Oh, my God.
A big-bottomed sea witch May bob through the waves
And hope to lead sailors astray
But a true ocean goddess Must fill out her bodice
To present an alluring display
Oh!
Beware of old oysters too large in the chest
Let's banish them from the buffet
I'm far more nutritious
You smell like the fishes
Did I hear a banshee?
You're sea green with envy
This mermaid enchantress
No, I, Birth of Venus
- Will send sailors swooning... - Will send sailors swooning all day
I can't look.
Ready to break a leg, Miriam?
Our lives for the theater, April.
"What a piece of work is man!
How noble in reason!"
"How infinite in faculty."
"In form, in moving how express and admirable!"
"In action like an angel."
"In apprehension how like a god!"
"The beauty of the world!"
"The paragon of animals!"
Yeah!
Hey, there.
Was it wonderful, dear?
Oh, yeah.
They swooped down and pulled me right out of my seat,
Spink and Forcible, only they weren't old ladies.
That was just a disguise.
But then, I was flying through the air, and it was...
It was magic.
You do like it here, don't you, Coraline?
Good night, Wybie.
You could stay here forever if you want to.
- Really?
- Sure.
We'll sing and play games, and Mother will cook your favorite meals.
There's one tiny little thing we need to do.
- What's that?
- Well, it's a surprise.
For you, our little doll.
Black is traditional.
But if you'd prefer pink or vermillion or chartreuse...
Though you might make me jealous.
No way!
You're not sewing buttons in my eyes!
But we need a "yes" if you want to stay here.
So sharp you won't feel a...
There, now. It's your decision, darling.
We only want what's best for you.
I'm going to bed.
Right now!
- Bed?
- Before dinner?
I'm really, really tired.
Yeah.
I just need to sleep on things.
Well, of course you do, darling.
I'll be happy to tuck you in.
Oh, no, thanks.
You've done so much already.
You're welcome.
And I...
We aren't worried at all, darling.
Soon you'll see things our way.
What's wrong, Coraline?
Don't you wanna play?
Yeah!
I wanna hug your face!
Get a grip, soldier!
Hey!
- Hey!
Where's your buttons, Loper?
You want to stay, don't you?
Going home tonight, robots, and I won't be back.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
Gotosleep.
Gotosleep .
... a tiny little thing we need to do.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
So sharp you won't feel a thing.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
Soon you'll see things our way.
Mom!
Dad!
Oh, God.
I'm still here?
Hey, you!
Where's the other mother?
I wanna go home.
All will be swell, soon as Mother's refreshed.
Her strength is our strength.
Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.
If you won't even talk to me, I'm gonna find the other Wybie.
- He'll help me.
- No point.
He pulled a long face, and Mother didn't like it.
And what do you think you're doing?
Well, I'm getting out of here.
That's what I'm doing.
Something's wrong.
Shouldn't the old well be here?
Nothing out here.
It's the empty part of this world.
She only made what she knew would impress you.
But why?
Why does she want me?
She wants something to love, I think.
Something that isn't her.
Or maybe she'd just love something to eat.
Eat?
That's ridiculous.
Mothers don't eat daughters.
I don't know.
How do you taste?
But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it?
Walk around the world.
Small world.
Hang on.
Stop!
He's one of the circus mice!
I don't like rats at the best of times, but this one was sounding an alarm.
Good kitty.
They say even the proudest spirit can be broken with love.
Of course, chocolate never hurts.
Like one?
They're cocoa beetles from Zanzibar.
I want to be with my real mom and dad.
I want you to let me go.
Is that any way to talk to your mother?
You aren't my mother.
Apologize at once, Coraline!
No!
I'll give you to the count of three.
One.
Two.
Three!
What are you doing?
Ow! That hurts!
You may come out when you've learned to be a loving daughter.
Who's there?
Hush!
And shush.
For the beldam might be listening.
You...
You mean the other mother?
Who are you?
Don't remember our names, but I 'member my true mommy.
Why are you all here?
The beldam.
She spied on our lives through the little doll's eyes.
And saw that we weren't happy.
So she lured us away with treasures.
- And treats.
- And games to play.
Gave all that we asked.
Yet we still wanted more.
So we let her sew the buttons.
She said that she loved us.
But she locked us here.
And ate up our lives.
Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever.
Not if she wants to win my life.
Beating her is my only chance.
Perhaps, if you do win your escape, you could find our eyes.
Has she taken those, too?
Yes, miss.
And hidden them.
Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls will be freed.
I...
I'll try.
Wybie?
Did she do this to you?
- I hope that feels...
Coraline?
Is that you?
Let's go!
Coraline!
Come on!
She'll hurt you again.
Coraline!
How dare you disobey your mother!
Coraline!
I'm home!
Anybody here?
Hello?
Hello, hello!
Real Dad?
Real Mom?
Oh, Mom's groceries!
That's disgusting.
I missed you guys so much, you'll never...
The Wybie that talks.
Yeah, so, you know that old doll I gave you?
My grandma's real mad.
Says it was her sister's.
- The one that disappeared.
- You stole that doll, didn't you?
Well, it looked just like you, and I figured...
It used to look like this pioneer girl, then Huck Finn Jr., then it was this Little Rascals chick with all these ribbons and braids and...
Grandma's missing sister.
I think I just met her.
Come on.
Listen, I'm really not supposed to...
She's in there.
Can you...
Can you unlock it?
Not in a million years.
But it wouldn't matter.
She can't escape without her eyes.
None of the ghosts can.
Yeah.
So I really need to get that doll.
Great!
I'd love to get rid of it.
Where are you hiding, you little monster?
- You and Grandma been talking?
- The doll's her spy.
It's how she watches you, finds out what's wrong with your life.
- The doll is my grandma's spy? - No.
The other mother.
She's got this whole world where everything's better.
The food, the garden, the neighbors.
But it's all a trap.
Yeah, I think I heard someone calling me, Jonesy.
Don't believe me?
You can ask the cat.
The cat?
I'll just tell Grandma that you couldn't find the doll. Ow!
You're not listening to me!
That's 'cause you're crazy!
You creep!
- Crazy!
Crazy?
You're the jerk wad that gave me the doll!
Mom!
Dad!
Pick it up, Dad.
Pick it up.
Dad!
Where...
I'm digging in my garden right now, but leave a message and I'll get right back to you.
Where have you gone?
Uh... Don't you only make wings for the dead ones?
Just looking ahead, dear.
Angus hasn't been feeling very well of late.
April?
Aren't you getting ready?
We've lost our ride, Miriam.
Caroline says her parents have vanished quite completely.
What?
We've waited months for those tickets.
I suppose we could walk.
With your gammy legs?
It's nearly two miles to the theater.
Oh, yes.
Your missing parents.
We know just what you need.
Miriam, get...
That's right.
How is 100-year-old candy gonna help?
There you go, sweetie.
- What's it for?
- Well, it might help.
They're good for bad things sometimes.
No.
They're good for lost things.
It's bad things, Miriam.
Lost things, April.
- Bad.
Lost.
- Bad things.
- Lost.
- Bad.
- Lost.
- Bad.
- Lost.
- Bad.
Lost!
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.
Hello.
How did you get in?
Do you know where Mom and Dad are?
Mom?
Dad!
How did this happen?
She's taken them.
They're not coming back, are they?
Mom and Dad.
Not on their own.
Only one thing to do.
You know, you're walking right into her trap.
I have to go back.
They are my parents.
Challenge her, then.
She may not play fair, but she won't refuse.
She's got a thing for games.
Okay.
Coraline?
- Mom?
Coraline!
You came back for us.
Mom!
Darling, why would you run away from me?
Where are my parents?
Gosh, I have no idea where your old parents are.
Perhaps they've grown bored of you and run away to France.
They weren't bored of me.
You stole them!
Now, don't be difficult, Coraline.
Have a seat, won't you?
- Why don't you have your own key?
- Only one key.
The garden squash need tending, don't you think, pumpkin?
Squish-squash, pumpkin sauce.
Mom?
Dad?
Where'd she hide you?
Breakfast time!
Be strong, Coraline.
Why don't we play a game?
- I know you like them.
- Everybody likes games.
What kind of game would it be?
An exploring game.
A finding things game.
And what is it you'd be finding, Coraline?
My real parents.
Too easy.
And the eyes of the ghost children.
What if you don't find them?
If I lose, I'll stay here with you forever and let you love me.
And I'll let you sew buttons into my eyes.
And if you somehow win this game?
Then you let me go.
You let everyone go.
My real father and mother, the dead children, everyone you've trapped here.
Deal.
Not till you give me a clue.
Oh, right.
In each of three wonders I've made just for you, a ghost's eye is lost in plain sight.
And for my parents?
Fine.
Don't tell me.
It's a deal.
What does she mean, "wonders?"
No!
Stop!
Why steal this?
That must be it!
Sorry.
So sorry.
Mother making me.
Don't wanna hurt you!
Take it!
Bless you, miss.
You found me!
But there's two eyes still lost.
Don't worry.
I'm getting the hang of it.
The pearl.
- Thief!
- Thief!
- Give it back!
- Give it back!
- Thief!
- Thief!
Give it back!
- Thief!
- Thief!
- Thief!
- Thief!
- Give it back!
- Thief!
- Thief!
- Give it back!
- Give it back!
- Thief!
- Give it back!
- Give it back!
Thief!
- Thief!
- Thief!
Stop!
Stop!
Thief!
Thief!
Thief!
Stop!
Hurry on, girl.
Her web is unwinding.
Oh, Wybie.
Evil witch!
I'm not scared!
Hello, galoobooshka.
I'm Coraline.
Is this what you're looking for?
You think winning game is good thing?
You'll just go home and be bored and neglected, same as always.
Stay here with us.
We will listen to you and laugh with you.
If you stay here, you can have whatever you want.
Always!
You don't get it, do you?
I don't understand.
Of course you don't understand.
You're just a copy she made of the real Mr. B.
Not even that anymore.
No!
No!
No!
Oh, God.
I've lost the game.
I've lost everything.
I think I mentioned that I don't like rats at the best of times.
I think you might have said something like that.
It looked like you needed this one, however.
Thank you.
I'm heading inside.
I still have to find my parents.
Come on, quickly!
So you're back.
And you brought vermin with you.
No.
I...
I brought a friend.
You know I love you.
You have a very funny way of showing it.
So where are they?
The ghost eyes?
Hold on.
We aren't finished yet.
Are we?
No, I suppose not.
After all, you still need to find your old parents, don't you?
Too bad you won't have this.
Be clever, miss.
Even if you win, she'll never let you go!
I already know where you've hidden them.
Well, produce them.
They're behind that door.
Oh, they are, are they?
There.
Mom.
Dad.
Go on. Open it.
They'll be there, all right.
You're wrong, Coraline.
They aren't there.
Now you're going to stay here forever.
No, I'm not!
No!
You horrible cheating girl!
No!
Where are you?
You selfish brat!
You dare disobey your mother?
Please shut it!
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!
I'll die without you!
Coraline, we're home.
Mom!
Dad!
I missed you so much!
Missed us?
Oh, no.
You broke my favorite snow globe.
I didn't break it.
It must've broke when you escaped.
And cut your knee.
Coraline, I asked you to count all the windows, not put your knee through them.
- But...
- Well, get yourself cleaned up.
- We're going out tonight.
- We got a lot to celebrate.
You're talking about your garden catalog?
Of course.
What else?
But look at the snow on your...
What's gotten into you, Coraline?
- So, gonna order the tulips?
- What's that?
For the garden party?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Dad!
So, Ma, invitations?
- Don't forget the invitations.
- Even Bobinsky?
Mr. B.'s not drunk, Mom.
He's just eccentric.
Good night, Coraline.
Hello again.
You still mad?
I'm really sorry I threw you at her, the other mother.
It was all I could think of.
I think it's time, don't you?
To set them free?
It's a fine, fine thing you did for us, miss.
Well, I'm glad it's finally over.
It is over and done with for us.
What about me?
You're in terrible danger, girl!
But how?
I locked the door!
It's the key, miss.
There's only one, and the beldam will find it.
'Tain't all bad, miss.
Thou art alive.
Thou art still living.
I gotta hide this somewhere, somewhere she can never...
Out of my way!
Oh, my twitchy-witchy girl
I think you are so nice
I give you bowls of porridge and I give you bowls of ice cream
I give you lots of kisses
And I give you lots of hugs
But I never give you sandwiches
With grease and worms and mung beans
I'm really sorry I didn't believe you about all this evil stuff, Coraline.
Why did you change your mind?
Well, Grandma showed me this picture after I called you crazy.
It's her and her sister, before she disappeared.
The Sweet Ghost Girl.
Wyborne!
Come home!
Oh, man.
What am I gonna tell her?
Just bring her by the house tomorrow.
We can tell her together.
We...
We can?
You know, I'm glad you decided to stalk me.
It wasn't my idea.
Thanks for helping me, Miss Spink, Miss Forcible.
Oh, look, April.
Pink ladies!
Actually, it's just lemonade.
How's Angus doing?
Oh, much better, dear, but he can't duck his wings forever.
Here comes a burp.
Charlie!
Excusez-moi, but that pizza, that was delicious.
Cold drinks?
- Oh, yeah.
Great.
You were right, Coraline.
I really hate dirt!
But the tulips look nice.
Thanks, Mom.
That is possible.
How are the mooshkas, Mr. B?
They tell me that you are savior, Caroline.
And soon as they are ready, they wish to give special thanks you performance.
Wyborne, I know where I'm going.
I grew up here.
Welcome, Miss Lovat!
Oh. Hello.
I'm Coraline Jones.
I've got so much to tell you.
Here.
- Thanks.
Do you want to pop a little gin in it, dear?
Of course.
When I was lying there in the VA hospital, with a big hole blown through the middle of my life,
I started having these dreams of flying.
I was free.
Sooner or later, though, you always have to wake up.
They can fix a spinal, if you got the money, but not on vet benefits, not in this economy.
A VA check and 12 bucks will get you a cup of coffee.
I'm what they call... waitlisted.
The Bengal Tiger, extinct for over a century is making a comeback.
These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo are the latest of a number of species that have been cloned back into existence in the past five years.
I became a marine for the hardship.
To be hammered on the anvil of life.
I told myself I can pass any test a man can pass.
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
Let's get it straight, upfront.
I don't want your pity.
You want a fair deal, you're on the wrong planet.
The strong prey on the weak.
That's just the way things are.
And nobody does a damn thing.
Get off!
Get off of him!
All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a single thing worth fighting for.
I hope you realized you just lost yourself a customer.
Candy-ass bitch.
If it ain't raining, we ain't training.
- It doesn't look like him.
- It's him.
You Jake Sully?
Step off.
You're ruining my good mood.
It's about your brother.
We're looking for Sully, T.
In there.
Jesus, Tommy.
The strong prey on the weak.
A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be for the paper in his wallet.
The concern of the suits was touching.
Your brother represented a significant investment.
We'd like to talk to you about taking over his contract.
And since your genome is identical to his, you could step into his shoes, so to speak.
It'd be a fresh start on a new world.
You could do something important.
You can make a difference.
And the pay is good.
Very good.
Tommy was the scientist, not me.
He was the one who wanted to get shot light-years out in space to find the answers.
Me, I was just another dumb grunt getting sent someplace he was gonna regret.
In cryo, you don't dream at all.
It doesn't feel like six years.
More like a fifth of tequila and an ass-kicking.
Are we there yet?
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.
We're there.
You've been in cryo for five years, nine months and 22 days.
You will be hungry.
You will be weak.
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks provided for your convenience.
The staff thanks you in advance.
Up ahead was Pandora.
You grew up hearing about it, but I never figured I'd be going there.
Valkyrie 1-6, copy...
Valkyrie 1-6, you are clear for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.
Copy, Venture Star. Go for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.
- Exo-packs on!
Let's go!
Exo-packs on!
- Exo-packs on! Let's go!
Remember, people, you lose that mask, you're unconscious in 20 seconds, you're dead in four minutes!
Let's nobody be dead today!
Looks very bad on my report.
Hell's Gate tower, this is TAV 1-6 on approach.
Crossing outer marker.
Mine is in sight.
Harnesses off!
Get your packs!
- Put it together, let's go!
Let's go!
- Harnesses off!
One minute!
When that ramp comes down, go directly into the base.
Do not stop!
Go straight inside.
Wait for my mark!
Go, go, go, go!
Get out of there! Keep moving!
Let's go, let's go!
There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.
You may be out, but you never lose the attitude.
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!
Well, well, ladies.
Look at all this fresh meat!
Back on Earth, these guys were Army dogs, Marines, fighting for freedom.
Look out, hot rod!
But out here they're just hired guns, taking the money, working for the company.
Check this out, man.
Meals on wheels.
Oh, man, that is just wrong.
I got two guys free in about 20 minutes!
Got it!
Need them!
You're not in Kansas anymore.
You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.
Respect that fact every second of every day.
If there is a hell, you might want to go there for some RR after a tour on Pandora.
Out there, beyond that fence, every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for Jujubes.
We have an indigenous population of humanoids called the Na'vi.
They're fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin that'll stop your heart in one minute.
And they have bones reinforced with naturally occurring carbon fiber.
They are very hard to kill.
As head of security, it is my job to keep you alive.
I will not succeed.
Not with all of you.
If you wish to survive, you need to cultivate a strong mental attitude.
You've got to obey the rules.
Pandora rules.
Rule number one...
There's nothing like an old-school safety brief to put your mind at ease.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Jake!
You're Jake, right?
Tom's brother.
Wow!
You look just like him.
Sorry, I'm Norm.
Spellman.
I went through avatar training with him.
...into the bio-lab.
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.
Hey!
How you doing?
Norm, avatar driver.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Link...
Here's the link room right here.
This is where we're connecting to the avatar.
Me and Norm are here to drive these remotely controlled bodies called avatars.
And they're grown from human DNA mixed with the DNA of the natives.
- Hey.
Welcome.
- Hey.
- Welcome to Pandora.
Good to have you.
- Thanks.
Damn!
They got big.
Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.
So the proprioceptive sims seem to work really well.
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.
It'll take us a few hours to get them decanted, but you guys can take them out tomorrow.
There's yours.
Hey.
Dr. Norm Spellman.
- Dr. Max Patel.
Great to meet you.
- Good to meet you, yeah.
Looks like him.
No, it looks like you.
This is your avatar now, Jake.
And the concept is that every driver is matched to his own avatar, so that their nervous systems are in tune,
or something.
Which is why they offered me the gig, because I can link with Tommy's avatar, which is insanely expensive.
Is this right?
I just say whatever to the video log?
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit of documenting everything.
You know, what we see, what we feel.
- It's all part of the science.
- And good science is good observation.
Plus it'll help to keep you sane for the next six years.
All right.
Whatever.
So...
Well, here I am, doing science.
They're coming out!
Attention.
Drivers coming out of link.
Oh, God.
Where's the lab coat?
Where's the lab coat?
Who's got my goddamn cigarette? Guys!
What's wrong with this picture?
- Thank you!
- Grace Augustine is a legend.
She's the head of the Avatar Program.
She wrote the book,
I mean, literally wrote the book on Pandoran botany.
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants better than people.
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.
Grace, I'd like you to meet Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.
Norm.
I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?
- Grace?
This is Jake Sully.
- Ma'am.
Yeah, yeah.
I know who you are, and I don't need you.
I need your brother.
You know, the PhD who trained for three years for this mission?
He's dead.
I know it's a big inconvenience for everyone.
- How much lab training have you had?
- I dissected a frog once.
You see?
You see?
I mean, they're just pissing on us without even the courtesy of calling it rain.
- I'm going to Selfridge.
- No, Grace,
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No, man, this is such bullshit!
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.
He has no business sticking his nose in my department.
Here tomorrow, 0800.
Try and use big words.
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.
You are cleared for south departure.
Hover taxi, Delta runway.
Squawk ident.
- You see that?
- Yes, sir.
No, you didn't.
You were looking at the monitor.
I love this putter, Ronnie!
I love this putter.
Parker, you know, I used to think it was benign neglect, but now I see that you're intentionally screwing me.
Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.
I need a researcher.
Not some jarhead dropout.
Well, actually, I thought we got lucky with him.
- Lucky?
- Yeah.
How is this in any way lucky?
Lucky your guy had a twin brother, and lucky that brother wasn't some oral hygienist or something.
A Marine we can use.
I'm assigning him to your team as security escort.
The last thing I need is another trigger-happy moron out there!
Look, look, you're supposed to be winning the hearts and the minds of the natives.
Isn't that the whole point of your little puppet show?
If you look like them and you talk like them, then they'll start trusting us.
We build them a school, we teach them English, but after, what, how many years?
Relations with the indigenous are only getting worse.
Yeah, that tends to happen when you use machine guns on them.
Right.
Come here.
I can't...
I can't...
This is why we're here.
Unobtanium.
Because this little gray rock sells for 20 million a kilo.
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.
It's what pays for your science.
Now, those savages are threatening our whole operation, we're on the brink of war, and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution.
So use what you've got, and get me some results.
So, how much link time have you logged?
- About 520 hours.
- That's good.
You're in there.
You're here.
How much have you logged?
Zip.
But I read a manual.
Tell me you're joking.
This is cool.
Let's go.
Don't.
I got this.
So you just figured you'd come out here, to the most hostile environment known to man, with no training of any kind, and see how it went?
What was going through your head?
Maybe I was sick of doctors telling me what I couldn't do.
- Biometrics are good.
- Link three is ready.
Keep your arms in, hands in, head down.
Down.
Just relax and let your mind go blank.
That shouldn't be hard for you.
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white...
Initiate link.
Run sequence unit three.
Go.
Launching.
I have the first congruency.
- That's a gorgeous brain.
Nice activity.
- Go figure.
Phase-Iock 40%.
All right.
Going in.
I'm going in in four.
Phase-Iock 99%.
Link is stable.
He's in.
Jake, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Jake?
Pupillary reflex is good.
Pinna response normal.
How you feeling, Jake?
Hey, guys.
Welcome to your new body, Jake.
Good!
Yeah, we're gonna take this nice and easy, Jake.
- And touch your thumb to your fingers.
- Yeah.
- Thumb to your fingers.
- No problem.
That's good.
I can see you can remember that one.
- Got it.
- Well, if you want to sit up,
- that's fine.
- Okay, good.
Just take it nice and slow, Jake.
Good.
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all?
You're wiggling your toes!
- Good.
Good, Jake.
- That's great.
Distal motor control is good.
Good, Jake.
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?
That's great, Jake.
Hold on, now.
Take it easy.
Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?
There's a few more sensory motor reflex tests we need to run,
- so take it easy.
- Wait.
- Jake.
- Sit down, Jake.
Jake!
Listen to me.
Jake!
- I need you to sit down.
Jake!
- It's okay.
- Buddy, listen to me.
- It's all good.
I got this.
- Jake, you need to sit down right now.
- Guys, get him back on the gurney now.
Listen to me.
For your own safety, you need to sit down.
You need time to adjust to the avatar... Whoa!
Jake!
- God, Jake, watch your tail.
- Yeah!
Sedate!
Sedate him!
A thousand milligrams of Supitocam!
Stat!
Guys!
Guys!
Whoa!
Whoa!
By the numbers.
- Jake.
Come on.
- Jake!
Listen to me.
You're not used to your avatar body.
- This is dangerous.
- This is great.
- Jake?
Jake, listen to me.
- Come on.
They're gonna put you out.
- Norm, sit down.
- No, no.
I gotta get out of these leads.
God damn it!
Bring them home!
- Norm!
Do not leave control!
- You're not ready for it!
- Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.
- So close!
I don't even have to play defense on it.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
- It's okay, I'll get him.
- Jake, you have to come back!
Jake!
Jake!
Excuse me.
- Watch it!
- Sorry!
Come on!
Jake!
We're not supposed to be running!
- Jeez!
Sorry.
- Watch it!
Hey, Marine!
Damn.
- Grace?
- Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?
Think fast.
Motor control's looking good.
Come on, everybody, quiet down!
All right, gang, lights out.
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't play with that, you'll go blind.
That's kind of freaky.
Come on.
Scat.
Good night.
Lights out!
See you at dinner, kiddies.
Welcome back.
- You okay?
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm Trudy.
I fly all the science sorties.
And this here is my baby.
Hold on a second.
Hey, Wainfleet!
Get it done!
- We bounce at zero-nine.
- Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!
Vine strike's still loose.
You guys are packing some heavy gear.
Watch it!
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not the only thing flying around out there.
Or the biggest.
I'm gonna need you on a door gun.
I'm a man short.
I thought you'd never ask.
There's your man.
See you on the flight line.
You wanted to see me, Colonel?
This low gravity'll make you soft.
You get soft,
Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning.
I pulled your record, Corporal.
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.
Nothing like this here, though.
You got some heart, kid, showing up in this neighborhood.
I figured it's just another hellhole.
I was First Recon myself.
A few years ahead of you.
Well, maybe more than a few.
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.
I come out here?
Day one.
Think I felt like a shavetail louie?
Yeah.
They could fix me up, if I rotated back.
Yeah, and make me pretty again.
But you know what?
I kind of like it.
It reminds me every day what's waiting out there.
The Avatar Program is a bad joke.
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.
However, it does present an opportunity both timely and unique.
- Clear!
- Clear!
A recon gyrene in an avatar body.
That's a potent mix.
Give me the goose bumps.
Such a Marine could provide the intel I need, right on the ground.
Right in the hostiles' camp.
Look, Sully.
I want you to learn these savages from the inside.
I want you to gain their trust.
I need to know how to force their cooperation or hammer them hard if they won't.
- Am I still with Augustine?
- On paper.
Yeah, you walk like one of her science pukes, you quack like one, but you report to me.
Can you do that for me, son?
Hell, yeah, sir.
Well, all right, then.
Son, I take care of my own.
You get me what I need,
I'll see to it you get your legs back when you rotate home.
Your real legs.
That sounds real good, sir.
- Link's ready!
- Phase-Iock 40%.
Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking.
I have five congruencies.
Phase-Iock 90%.
Link three ready.
All right, I'm going in.
Sturmbeest herd coming up on your right.
Got it!
Thanks.
Looks like a bull, a dozen cows and some juveniles.
Shut it down.
We're gonna stay a while.
- Norm!
Your pack.
- Pack.
Stay with the ship.
One idiot with a gun is enough.
You the man, Doc.
Prolemuris.
They're not aggressive.
Relax, Marine.
You're making me nervous.
So, how will they know we're here?
I'm sure they're watching us right now.
This was our school.
Now it's just... storage.
The kids were so bright.
Eager to learn.
They picked up English faster than I could teach it.
So, we'll take a couple of these Ph monitors and a soil probe.
That little yellow case back there.
The old microscope.
Here.
Oh, yeah.
I love this one.
The stingbats knocked them down.
I keep hoping someone will come back in and read them.
Why don't they come back?
The Omaticaya...
learned as much about us as they needed to.
What happened here?
Are you going to help us with this gear?
We've got a lot to do.
- Keep moving, Norm.
- Keep up, guys!
- And here I go.
- Scanning.
Wow!
It's that fast?
- Amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah.
So, that is signal transduction from this root to the root of the tree next to it.
Okay.
Sample.
You know, it's probably electrical, based on the speed of the reaction.
Norm, you've contaminated the sample with your saliva.
Right.
So, here I go.
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.
It's already pissed off.
Jake, that armor's too thick.
Trust me.
It's a territorial threat display.
Do not run, or he'll charge.
So, what do I do, dance with it?
Just hold your ground.
Yeah?
Come on!
What you got?
Oh, yeah.
Who's bad?
That's right.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.
That's right, get your punk ass back to mommy.
Yeah?
Yeah, you got nothing.
You keep running.
Yeah, and why don't you bring back some of your friends, huh?
Oh, shit.
So what about this one?
Run? Don't run?
What?
Run!
Definitely run!
I'm gonna have to call it, guys.
We're not allowed to run night ops.
Colonel's orders.
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have to hang on till morning.
He won't make it till morning.
I don't have all goddamn night.
Come on!
Come on!
Hey, wait.
Don't!
Great.
Look, I know you probably don't understand this,
but thank you.
Thank you.
That was pretty impressive.
I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along.
It was...
Hey, wait a second.
Hey, where you going?
Wait up!
Just...
Hey, slow down.
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say thanks for killing those things.
- Damn!
- Don't thank.
You don't thank for this.
This is sad.
Very sad only.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Whatever I did, I am sorry.
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.
My fault?
They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?
Your fault!
- Your fault!
- Easy.
Easy.
You're like a baby.
Making noise, don't know what to do.
Easy.
Fine.
Fine.
If you love your little forest friends, why not let them just kill my ass?
What's the thinking?
- Why save you?
- Yeah.
Yeah, why save me?
You have a strong heart.
No fear.
But stupid!
Ignorant like a child.
Well, if I'm like a child, then...
Look, maybe you should teach me.
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.
Well, then teach me how to See.
- No one can teach you to See.
- Whoa.
Look, come on, can't we talk?
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?
Dr. Augustine's school?
You're like a baby.
I need your help.
You should not be here.
- Okay, take me with you.
- No!
Go back.
No.
Go back.
No!
What...
What are they?
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.
Very pure spirits.
What was that all about?
Come.
Come!
Where are we going?
Come.
What's your name?
Shit!
Okay.
What's going on?
Wait.
What's happening?
Hey!
What's he saying?
Hey, what's he saying?
My father is deciding whether to kill you.
Your father.
It's nice to meet you, sir.
That is Mother.
She is Tsahik.
The one who interprets the will of Eywa.
Who's Eywa?
What are you called?
Jake Sully.
- Why did you come to us?
- I came to learn.
We have tried to teach other Sky People.
It is hard to fill a cup which is already full.
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.
Just ask Dr. Augustine.
I'm no scientist.
What are you?
I was a Marine.
A...
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.
It is decided.
My daughter will teach you our ways.
Learn well, Jakesully.
Then we will see if your insanity can be cured.
Good evening.
Please don't get up.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Hey, how you doing?
Thank you.
You know, I don't even know your name.
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.
Again, a whole lot slower?
Neytiri.
Neytili.
Neytiri.
Neytiri.
It's nice to meet you, Neytiri.
It's nice.
- Jake.
Jake!
- He's in alpha.
- He's coming out right now.
- Jake. Jake!
Come on back, kid. Come on.
That's it.
There you go.
There you go, there you go.
You're okay.
You're okay.
Damn!
You were dug in like a tick.
- Is the avatar safe?
- Yeah, Doc.
And you are not gonna believe where I am.
The last thing we see is this Marine's ass disappearing into the brush with this angry thanator coming after him.
- Hey, it's not something you can teach.
- That is awesome.
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom, the Omaticaya have chosen you.
God help us all.
"Jarhead clan"?
- And it worked?
- Hey, I'm practically family.
They're gonna study me.
I have to learn to be one of them.
That's called taking the initiative, son.
- I wish I had 10 more like you.
- Look, Sully.
Sully.
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.
You know, I mean, we try to give them medicine, education, roads.
But no, no, no, they like mud.
And that wouldn't bother me, it's just that they're...
Hey, can you...
Can somebody just...
Sector 12.
Okay, go, go, go, stop.
Stop...
Rich, stop!
That's...
Jesus!
Their damn village happens to be resting on the richest unobtanium deposit within 200 klicks in any direction.
I mean, look at all that cheddar!
- Well, who gets them to move?
- Guess.
- What if they won't go?
- I'm betting that they will.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey.
Look.
Look.
Killing the indigenous looks bad, but there's one thing that shareholders hate more than bad press, and that's a bad quarterly statement.
I didn't make up the rules.
So just find me a carrot that'll get them to move, otherwise it's gonna have to be all stick.
You got three months.
That's when the 'dozers get there.
Well, we're wasting time.
I like this guy.
- Guys, right now...
- Okay, let's run through them again.
Mo'at.
Dragon lady.
- Eytucan.
- Eytukan.
He's the clan leader.
But she's the spiritual leader.
Like a shaman.
Got it.
- T'su'tey.
- Tsu'tey.
- Tsu'tey.
- He'll be the next clan leader.
- Neytiri.
- She'll be the next Tsahik.
They become a mated pair.
- So who's this Eywa?
- Who's Eywa?
Only their deity.
Their goddess, made up of all living things.
Everything they know!
You'd know this if you had any training whatsoever.
Who's got a date with the chief's daughter?
Come on.
That's...
Knock it off.
It's like kindergarten around here.
Neytiri was my best student.
She and her sister, Sylwanin.
Just amazing girls.
I got a date with Sylwanin too.
She's dead.
Let's go.
Village life starts early.
Don't do anything unusually stupid.
Easy, boy.
Pale is female.
Okay.
Easy, girl.
That is shahaylu.
The bond.
Feel her.
Feel her heartbeat.
Her breath.
Feel her strong legs.
You may tell her what to do.
Inside.
For now, say where to go.
Forward!
- You should go away.
- No, you'd miss me.
I knew you could speak English.
Again.
If you want to hit this thing, it's gonna be complicated.
Your scan doesn't show the internal structure.
There's an outer row of columns.
Real heavy duty.
There's a secondary ring here, and an inner ring.
There's a core structure like a spiral.
That's how they move up and down.
We're gonna need accurate scans on every column.
Roger that.
What else can you tell us about the structure?
I'm guessing this secondary ring, that's also load-bearing.
- So where are we going?
- Getting out of Dodge.
I'm not about to let Selfridge and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.
There's a mobile link up at Site 26 we can work out of, way up in the mountains.
The Hallelujah Mountains?
- That's right.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
- Yes!
The legendary floating mountains of Pandora.
Heard of them?
We're getting close.
Yeah, look at my instruments.
Yep.
We're in the Flux Vortex.
We're VFR from here on.
What's VFR?
Means you gotta see where you're going.
- You can't see anything.
- Exactly.
Ain't that a bitch?
Oh, my God.
You should see your faces.
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.
So what does hold them up?
Grace explained it to me.
Some kind of maglev effect.
Because unobtanium is a superconductor... or something.
Welcome to camp.
- So, this is my bunk.
- This stuff is nasty.
- Norm, go under.
- All right.
- Grace didn't miss a thing.
- Trudy, you'll take the top one.
She knew I was talking to the Colonel.
But I had what she needed, a way back in with the clan, so she's playing nice.
All right.
Jake, hang a left.
You'll be in the link at the end.
Unit one.
Beulah.
She's the least glitchy.
Holy shit!
Do not look in her eye.
Ikran is not horse.
Once shahaylu is made,
ikran will fly with only one hunter in the whole life.
To become taronyu, hunter, you must choose your own ikran and he must choose you.
- When?
- When you are ready.
Okay.
This is video log 12.
Time's 2132.
Do I have to do this now?
I really need to get some rack.
No, now.
When it's fresh.
Okay, location, shack, and the days are starting to blur together.
The language is a pain, but, you know,
I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon.
Just repetition, repetition.
- Navi.
- "Nari."
- Nari.
- "Narrri"!
Narrri!
TxurnÌ'ul.
Stronger.
Neytiri calls me skxawng.
It means moron.
This is a very important part of it.
- Norm's attitude has improved lately.
- I see you. I see you.
But it's not just, "I'm seeing you in front of me,"
it's "I see into you.
I See you."
It's good he's back on board, but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.
"I'm accepting you.
I understand you." So you gotta get this, okay?
I gotta run! Okay?
Let's go.
My feet are getting tougher.
I can run farther every day.
I have to trust my body to know what to do.
Yeah!
Check it out!
Oh, crap!
Every day it's reading the trails, the tracks at the waterhole, the tiniest scents and sounds.
She's always going on about the flow of energy, the spirits of animals.
I really hope this tree-hugger crap isn't on the final.
This isn't just about eye-hand coordination out there, you know.
You need to listen to what she says.
Try to see the forest through her eyes.
Excuse me.
This is my video log here.
With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.
You gotta be kidding me.
I talked Mo'at into letting Grace into the village.
It's the first time since her school was closed down.
Come on, Marine.
I'm trying to understand this deep connection the people have to the forest.
She talks about a network of energy that flows through all living things.
She says all energy is only borrowed, and one day you have to give it back.
You were in 16 hours today.
You're still losing weight.
No, you don't.
- I gotta get some sleep.
- Come back here.
Bon appétit.
Today I made a kill.
And we ate it.
At least, I know where that meal came from.
Other body.
You need to take care of this body.
Okay?
- Get it?
Let's eat it.
- Yeah, yeah.
Here.
I'll make it easy for you.
Give it to me.
- You look like crap.
- Thank you.
You're burning way too hard.
Get rid of this shit.
And then you can lecture me.
Now, I'm telling you, as your boss, and as someone who might even consider being a friend someday to take some down time.
Eat this, please.
Trust me, I...
learned the hard way.
What did happen at the school, Grace?
Neytiri's sister, Sylwanin, stopped coming to school.
She was angry about the clear-cutting.
And one day, she and a couple of other young hunters came running in all painted up.
They had set a bulldozer on fire.
I guess they thought I could protect them.
The troopers pursued them to the school.
They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.
Right in front of Neytiri.
And then shot the others.
I got most of the kids out.
But they never came back.
I'm sorry.
A scientist stays objective.
We can't be ruled by emotion.
But I put 10 years of my life into that school.
They called me sa'nok.
Mother.
Mother.
That kind of pain reaches back through the link.
A clean kill.
You are ready.
Learning to ride an ikran, we call them banshees, is the test every young hunter has to pass.
But to do that, you gotta go where the banshees are.
Oo-rah.
Now what?
Jakesully will go first.
Now you choose your ikran.
This you must feel inside.
If he also chooses you, move quick like I showed.
You will have one chance, Jake.
How will I know if he chooses me?
He will try to kill you.
Outstanding.
Let's dance.
Make the bond!
No!
Jake!
Shahaylu, Jake.
Shahaylu!
Stop!
Yeah, that's right.
You're mine.
Huh?
First flight seals the bond.
You cannot wait.
- Think, "Fly!"
- Fly?
God damn!
Oh, shit!
Shut up and fly straight!
That's it.
Bank left!
Level out!
That's it.
Jakesully!
Hey!
Let's go!
Yeah, baby, I got this!
Oh, shit!
I may not be much of a horse guy, but I was born to do this.
Yeah!
- I came like this.
This you.
- Yeah, yeah.
- I turn.
I feel the wind.
I turn very strong.
- Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard...
The Tree of Souls.
It's their most sacred place.
See the Flux Vortex in these false color images?
Yeah, that's what messes up my instruments.
There is something really interesting going on in there biologically.
I would die to get samples.
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.
You lucky swine.
Hell, yeah!
Hell, yeah!
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.
Death from above.
Only problem is, you're not the only one.
Dive!
Go, go!
Follow me!
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.
It is Toruk.
Last Shadow.
Yeah, right.
It's the last one you ever see.
My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk Macto.
Rider of Last Shadow.
He rode this?
Toruk chose him.
It has only happened five times since the time of the First Songs.
- That's a long time.
- Yes.
Toruk Macto was mighty.
He brought the clans together in a time of great sorrow.
All Na'vi people know the story.
Everything is backwards now.
Like out there is the true world and in here is the dream.
It's hard to believe it's only been three months.
I can barely remember my old life.
I don't know who I am anymore.
Haven't gotten lost in the woods, have you?
Your last report was more than two weeks ago.
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!
The way I see it, it's time to terminate the mission.
No, I can do this.
You already have.
You give me good, usable intel.
This Tree of Souls place.
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that when this turns into a shit fight, which it will.
Yeah.
Now it's time to come in.
By the way, you gonna get your legs back.
Yeah.
I got your corporate approval.
It's a done deal.
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.
I'm a man of my word.
I gotta finish this.
There's one more thing.
Ceremony.
It's the final stage of becoming a man.
If I do it, I'm one of them.
And they'll trust me.
And I can negotiate the terms of their relocation.
Well, then, you'd better get it done, Corporal.
The Na'vi say that every person is born twice.
The second time is when you earn your place among The People forever.
Come.
Come.
This is a place for prayers to be heard.
And sometimes answered.
We call these trees Utraya Mokri.
The Tree of Voices.
The voices of our ancestors.
I can hear them.
They live, Jake, within Eywa.
You are Omaticaya now.
You may make your bow from the wood of Hometree.
And you may choose a woman.
We have many fine women.
Ninat is the best singer.
But I don't want Ninat.
Beyral is a good hunter.
Yeah, she is a good hunter.
I've already chosen.
But this woman must also choose me.
She already has.
I am with you now, Jake.
We are mated for life.
What the hell are you doing, Jake?
Ma Jake!
Don't forget your phase integration.
- Jake!
- No, no, the middle button.
- You gotta eat something.
- Yeah, there you go.
Jake!
Jake.
Wake up!
Jake, please!
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.
Grace, I don't want...
Hey!
Jake!
Okay.
Here.
I'm done.
Let's go.
And when was the last time you took a shower?
- I don't need a shower.
- Jesus, Marine.
Jake!
Jake!
Wake up!
Jake!
Wake up!
Hey!
Stop!
Stop!
- Jake!
- Go back, stop!
Hey, boss.
Hey!
- What?
- I got a native doing the funky chicken here.
He's blocking my blade.
Well, keep going.
He'll move.
These people have to learn that we don't stop.
Come on, go, go, go.
Stop!
Hey!
Go!
Go!
There, see?
He moved.
Dude, dude.
Whoa, dude!
Dude, no!
I'm blind.
- Jake!
- Neytiri!
Here, come on!
Freeze it right there.
Scale up.
Enhance.
Son of a bitch.
Unbelievable.
- Get me a pilot.
- Yes, sir.
You do not speak here!
Tsu'tey!
Don't do this.
- You!
- Listen.
Brother...
- You mated with this woman?
- Oh, shit.
Is this true?
We are mated before Eywa.
It is done.
Brother, please.
Do not attack the Sky People.
Many Omaticaya will die if you do.
You are not my brother!
And I am not your enemy!
The enemy is out there, and they are very powerful!
Go!
Go!
Go!
- I can talk to them.
- No more talk.
Tsu'tey!
I am Omaticaya.
I am one of you.
And I have the right to speak.
The words are like stones in my heart.
Sir, I'm sorry.
No, no, no!
Hold on!
You can't interrupt a link in progress!
It's very dangerous!
Grace!
Oh, no.
- Wait!
- Stay down, sir.
Okay.
Look...
I was sent here to...
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- You crossed the line.
Wheel this meat out of here.
Jake!
What the hell is going on here?
You let me down, son.
So, what, you find yourself some local tail and you just completely forget what team you're playing for?
Parker, there is time to salvage the situation.
- Parker...
- Shut your pie hole!
Or what, Ranger Rick?
You gonna shoot me?
- I could do that.
- You need to muzzle your dog.
Yeah, can we just take this down a couple of notches, please?
You say you want to keep your people alive?
You start by listening to her.
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya
- in a way you can't imagine.
- You know what?
You throw a stick in the air around here, it's gonna land on some sacred fern,
- for Christ's sake!
- I'm not talking about some kind of pagan voodoo here.
I'm talking about something real, something measurable in the biology of the forest.
Something measurable in the biology of the forest.
Which is what, exactly?
What we think we know is that there is some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees, like the synapses between neurons.
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth connections to the trees around it.
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees on Pandora.
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.
It's more connections than the human brain.
Get it?
It's a network.
It's a global network, and the Na'vi can access it.
They can upload and download data.
Memories.
At sites like the one you just destroyed.
Yes!
What the hell have you people been smoking out there?
They're just goddamn trees!
- You need to wake up, Parker.
- No.
You need to wake up.
The wealth of this world isn't in the ground.
It's all around us.
The Na'vi know that, and they are fighting to defend it.
If you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them.
I'd say we understand them just fine, thanks to Jake here.
Hey, Doc, come take a look.
They're not gonna give up their home.
They're not gonna make a deal.
For what?
Lite beer?
And blue jeans?
There's nothing that we have that they want.
Everything they sent me out here to do is a waste of time.
They're never gonna leave Hometree.
So, since a deal can't be made, I guess things get real simple.
Jake, thanks.
I'm getting all emotional.
I might just give you a big wet kiss.
Talk to me, Lyle.
It looks like they hit it with banshees first.
See the angle's steep?
They set the ampsuit on fire.
Driver's toast.
The rest of the squad?
Six bodies.
That's all of them.
The equipment's totaled.
Jesus Christ.
I'll do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous.
I'll drive them out with gas first.
It'll be humane.
More or less.
All right, let's pull the trigger.
Come on, people.
Let's get it packed, let's go.
You know, they never even wanted us to succeed.
They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose to trigger a response.
Just fabricating this war to get what they want.
This is how it's done.
When people are sitting on shit that you want, you make them your enemy.
Then you're justified in taking it.
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.
He's gonna hit Hometree.
My God.
- Dr. Augustine!
You cannot be up here!
- Back off!
Parker.
Wait. Stop.
These are people you're about to...
- No.
No, no, no, no.
- I said back off!
They're fly-bitten savages that live in a tree!
All right?
Look around!
I don't know about you, but I see a lot of trees!
They can move!
- Can you guys just please...
- Yes, sir.
There are families in there.
There are children.
Babies.
Are you gonna kill children?
You don't want that kind of blood on your hands.
Believe me.
Just let me try to talk them out.
They trust me.
Calibrate fast.
We're going in, right now.
Calibrating three and four.
- Run sequence.
- Initiating.
Thirty seconds.
Listen to me.
You've got one hour.
Unless you want your girlfriend in there when the ax comes down, you get them to evacuate.
One hour.
Look, tell them they're gonna be here soon.
You have to leave, or you're gonna die.
Are you certain of this?
Look, they sent me here to learn your ways so one day I could bring this message and that you would believe it.
What are you saying, Jake?
You knew this would happen?
Yes.
Look, at first it was just orders, and then everything changed.
Okay?
I fell in love.
I fell in love with the forest and with the Omaticaya people.
And with you.
- I trusted you. - With you.
With you.
- I trusted you!
- Trust me now, please.
You will never be one of The People!
- I shouldn't have...
- We tried to stop them!
Neytiri, please!
Please.
You have to go.
They're coming!
Time on target, one mike.
Copy.
We have a visual.
Roger that.
Stay on heading 030.
Roger, 030.
- Run to the forest!
- They're coming!
- They will destroy this place.
- Neytiri, you must go now!
Run to the forest!
Run!
Run!
Run!
No!
God damn it, run!
That is one big damn tree.
Well, well, well.
I'd say diplomacy has failed.
All right, people, let's get this done!
I want every gas round you got right in the front door.
Roger.
CS.40's going hot.
- Fire.
- Firing.
Bingo.
Mighty good shooting, ace.
Sir, they've opened fire.
You've got to be kidding me!
These dumb bastards ain't getting the message.
All right, let's turn up the heat.
- Switch incendiaries!
- Switching incendiaries.
Fire.
No!
And that's how you scatter the roaches.
Neytiri!
We gotta move!
He's gonna blow the columns!
My God!
- Lf you are one of us, help us.
No!
All call signs, switch missiles.
Give me HE's at the base of the west columns.
This way!
Rider section, switch missiles.
- One's good.
- Two's rocks up.
- Three's up.
- Yeah, baby, get some!
Charlie Oscar, Gunrunner standing by.
- Bring it down.
- Cleared hot.
Come on, Grace, move!
Down!
Head down!
Come on, come on!
Down!
- Solid hits.
- Solid rocks on target.
Screw this.
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?
I didn't sign up for this shit!
Repeat.
Ripple fire.
Go!
Go!
Go!
No, no, get back!
Back!
Come on!
Come on, move!
Move!
That's good work, people.
First round's on me tonight.
Let's boogie.
Dragon coming left, heading home.
Gunrunner coming left.
- Thunder copies.
- Rider section copies.
Neytiri!
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Get away.
Get away!
Get away from here!
Never come back!
Pull the plug.
- No, you can't do that!
- You can't do that!
- Calm down!
Calm down!
- No!
Please!
I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace.
Sooner or later, though, you always have to wake up.
Let's go!
Put him down!
You murderer!
What's going on, brother?
Long time no see.
Hey.
Personally, I don't feel these tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.
They get steak?
That's bullshit.
Let me see that.
Yeah.
You know what that is.
Down.
- Trudy!
- All the way down.
Max!
Trudy, fire up the ship!
Go!
Here.
- Clear. Come on.
- Here you go.
Max, stay here.
I need someone on the inside I can trust.
Okay.
Go.
Clear.
Come on, baby.
Colonel?
Sir? I got a situation here.
It's Samson 1-6.
Unauthorized engine start.
Three!
Come on!
Mask on!
Gas, gas, gas!
I'm taking fire!
Let's go!
Grab my hand!
Come on, we're in.
Let's go!
Come on, let's go!
Let's go, go!
Colonel!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
- All right!
Yes!
- Crap.
- Everybody all right back there?
Oh, yeah, baby!
- Norm, you good?
- Yeah!
This is gonna ruin my whole day.
- Grace is hit!
- What?
- Get the trauma kit.
- Trauma kit!
- Keep the pressure on, Grace.
- Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.
- Hang on, Grace.
- Doesn't matter.
It's fine.
- You're good to go.
- Take it up!
Hold on.
I'm pulling pitch.
You're clear!
Just keep going north.
Get us deep in the mountains.
Copy that.
- Norm, you all good up there?
- Yep!
Still here.
Well, at least they can't track us up here.
Not this far into the Vortex.
It's strongest at the Tree of Souls, right?
Yeah.
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.
Ouch.
You big baby.
We're moving.
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.
I'm a scientist, remember?
I don't believe in fairy tales.
The People can help you.
I know it.
Why would they help us?
The People say Eywa will provide.
With no home, no hope, there was only one place they could go.
Link's running.
- What's the plan here, Jake?
- There's no plan.
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.
He's not gonna let you near that place.
I gotta try.
Launching.
Outcast.
Betrayer.
Alien.
I was in the place the eye does not see.
I needed their help, and they needed mine.
But to ever face them again,
I was gonna have to take it to a whole new level.
Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move.
There's something we gotta do.
You're not gonna like it.
The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.
Nothing attacks him.
Easy, boy.
So why would he ever look up?
But that was just a theory.
Toruk Macto?
I See you.
I See you.
I was afraid, Jake.
For my people.
I'm not anymore.
You are Olo'eyktan, and you are a great warrior.
I can't do this without you.
Toruk Macto,
I will fly with you.
My friend is dying.
Grace is dying.
I beg the help of Eywa.
Look where we are, Grace.
I need to take some samples.
The Great Mother may choose to save all that she is in this body.
Is that possible?
She must pass through the eye of Eywa and return.
But, Jakesully, she is very weak.
Hang on, Grace.
They're gonna fix you up.
Jake.
Grace.
I'm with her, Jake.
She's real!
Grace?
Grace, please.
Grace!
What's happening?
What's happening?
Grace!
Grace!
What's happening?
Did it work?
Her wounds were too great.
It was not enough time.
She is with Eywa now.
With your permission, I will speak now.
You would honor me by translating.
The Sky People have sent us a message
that they can take whatever they want and no one can stop them.
Well, we will send them a message.
You ride out as fast as the wind can carry you.
You tell the other clans to come.
You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them.
And you fly now with me!
My brothers!
Sisters!
And we will show the Sky People that they cannot take whatever they want,
and that this, this is our land!
Yah!
Yah!
Yah!
We rode out to the four winds.
To the horse clans of the plain.
Back to the stars!
To the ikran people ofthe Eastern Sea.
For our children's children!
When Toruk Macto called them, they came.
Yah!
Everyone on this base, every one of you, is fighting for survival.
That's a fact!
There's an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack.
Now, these orbital images tell me that the hostiles' numbers have gone from a few hundred to well over 2,000 in one day.
And more are pouring in.
In a week's time, there could be 20,000 of them.
At that point, they will overrun our perimeter.
Well, that's not gonna happen!
Our only security lies in pre-emptive attack.
We will fight terror with terror.
Now, the hostiles believe that this mountain stronghold of theirs is protected by their...
Their deity.
And when we destroy it, we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep that they won't come within 1,000 klicks of this place ever again.
And that, too, is a fact.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Jake, it's crazy here.
It's full mobilization.
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.
They've got these huge pallets of mine explosives.
It's for some kind of shock-and-awe campaign.
Fricking daisy cutters!
Quaritch has taken over.
He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.
- When?
- 0600 tomorrow.
- Max!
Max!
- I gotta go.
We're screwed!
And I was hoping for some sort of tactical plan that didn't involve martyrdom.
We're going up against gunships with bows and arrows.
I have 15 clans out there.
That's over 2,000 warriors.
Now, we know these mountains.
We fly them.
You fly them.
They don't.
Their instruments won't work up here.
Missile tracking won't work.
They'll have to fire a line of sight.
If they bring the fight to us, then we have the home-field advantage.
You know he's gonna commit that bomber straight to the Tree of Souls.
Yeah, I know.
If they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.
That's their direct line to Eywa, their ancestors.
It'll destroy them.
Then I guess we'd better stop him.
I'm probably just talking to a tree right now.
But if you're there, I need to give you a heads-up.
If Grace is with you, look into her memories.
See the world we come from.
There's no green there.
They killed their Mother.
And they're gonna do the same here.
More Sky People are gonna come.
They're gonna come like a rain that never ends.
Unless we stop them.
Look, you chose me for something.
I will stand and fight.
You know I will.
But I need a little help here.
Our Great Mother does not take sides, Jake.
She protects only the balance of life.
It was worth a try.
Yeah!
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!
Yeah!
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about, man!
This is Group Leader.
We are entering the Flux Vortex.
- Switch to manual flight mode.
- Copy.
Manual flight mode.
This is Papa Dragon.
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.
- Suit Team, go.
- All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!
Move, move, move!
Bravo 1-1, move left.
Bravo 1-1 moving left.
Watch flank.

Keep moving.
- Roger that.
Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing.
Copy that.
Over.
Eyes up.
Check that overhead.
And watch those thermal scans.
All call signs, Papa has lead, pushing to target.
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle.
We are gonna lose some paint in here.
Gun crews, keep your head on a swivel.
Make no mistake, people, they're out there.
All right, people, target in sight.
Range, four klicks.
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.
- Copy.
Prepare to offload.
- Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.
Roll it to the ramp!
Let's go!
Hold!
Charlie 2-1, got big movement.
- Hold position.
- Hold up, hold up.
- We got movement out there, 500 meters.
- Charlie 2-1, hold position.
Sir, ground has movement!
Fast approaching.
- Charlie Oscar, Rider section.
- Firing line!
Targets closing.
Range, 400 meters.
- Can't you clean it up?
- No, sir.
It's the Flux.
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole.
You follow me through.
All aircraft, weapons free!
Weapons free!
Break right.
Come around.
Light them up!
Break formation, engage all hostiles.
Yeah!
Get some!
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.
Jake!
Jake!
You copy?
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!
Copy.
Get out of there.
That's him.
Get after him!
Take him out!
Light her up!
Right there!
You're not the only one with a gun, bitch.
- Keep her in your sights. - Purging.
Feeding the leak.
Arming all pods.
That's it!
Seyzey!
Rogue One is hit.
I'm going in.
Sorry, Jake.
Fire.
Tsu'tey!
Brother, do you read?
Rogue One, you copy?
Trudy!
Time to target, two minutes.
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.
Copy, Dragon.
We are starting our bomb run.
- Arm number one!
- Number one armed!
Ma Jake!
I read you.
- Neytiri!
- Seyzey's dead.
They are very close.
They are many.
Do not attack.
Do you read me, Neytiri?
Do not attack!
Fall back now.
Get out of there!
That's an order!
Neytiri!
I got movement, I got movement.
Hold position.
Something's coming.
Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating.
Turn screens over.
- We got movement 200 meters.
- Hold your formation.
- Be ready.
- Watch your flanks.
Hundred meters and closing fast.
We gotta get out of here!
- Fall back!
Fall back!
- Move!
Move!
Move!
Fall back!
On the run!
On the run!
Jake, Eywa has heard you.
Eywa has heard you!
Come on!
Fall back!
Move!
Move!
Sir!
All escorts are down or falling back.
Let's get this done.
Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.
- Press to target.
- Copy.
Pressing to target.
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.
On my mark.
Two, one, mark.
Drop!
Drop!
Drop!
Go, go, go, go!
Drop!
Drop!
Drop!
Go, go, go, go!
Brace!
It's Sully.
- Mask on!
- Breach alarm!
Come on.
Come to papa.
Give it up, Quaritch!
It's all over.
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.
I kind of hoped you'd say that.
Come on!
Hey, Sully, how's it feel to betray your own race?
You think you're one of them?
Time to wake up.
Jake?
Jake.
Jake.
Jake!
Ma Jake!
I See you.
I See you.
I See you, Brother.
Are The People safe?
They're safe.
I can't...
I cannot lead The People.
You must lead them...
Jakesully.
I'm not officer material.
It is decided.
Now do the duty of Olo'eyktan.
I will not kill you.
It is the way!
And it is good.
I will be remembered.
I fought... with Toruk Macto!
And we were brothers.
And he... was my last shadow.
The aliens went back to their dying world.
Only a few were chosen to stay.
The time of great sorrow was ending.
Toruk Macto was no longerneeded.
Well, I guess this is my last video log.
'Cause whatever happens tonight, either way, I'm...
I'm not gonna be coming back to this place.
Well, I guess I'd better go.
Yeah, I don't want to be late for my own party.
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all.
This is Jake Sully signing off.
Head cocked to the left.
Partial deafness in ear.
First point of attack.
Two. Throat.
Paralyse vocal cords. Stop screaming.
Three. Got to be heavy drinker.
Floating rib to the liver.
Four. Finally, drag the left leg.
Fist the patella.
Summary prognosis: Conscious in 90 seconds
Martial efficacy: quarter of an hour at best.
Full faculty of recovery, unlikely.
- I like the hat.
- I just picked it up.
You remember your revolver?
Oh, knew I'd forgotten something.
- I thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.
I think that's quite enough.
You're a doctor, after all.
Always nice to see you, Watson.
Where is the inspector?
He's getting his troops lined up.
That could be all day.
Sherlock Holmes.
And his loyal dog.
Tell me, doctor
As a medical man, have you enjoyed my work?
Let me show you how much I've enjoyed it.
Watson!
Don't!
Observe.
How did you see that?
Because I was looking for it.
Lord Blackwood!
You seem surprised.
I'd say that the girl deserves our attention more than he.
Indeed.
Oh, I'd leave that alone if I were you, boyo.
Good lad.
Impeccable timing, Lestrade.
We've one for the doctor, and one for the rope.
- Clarky?
- Sir.
This woman needs a hospital immediately.
- Put her in the back of the maria.
- Right lads, that's it.
Come on.
If you don't mind.
Get him out of my sight.
And you were supposed to wait for my orders.
If I had, you'd be clearing up a corpse.
and chasing a rumor.
Besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the Yard.
Why they thought you'd require any assistance is beyond me?
- Well, London will breathe a sigh of relief.
- Indeed. - Congratulations, Lestrade.
- Bravo, Inspector. Have a cigar.
Gentlemen...
Cheese! 156 over 80.
Very good.
Me nerves are the best they've been in years, thanks to you.
Oh, tell me something:
Your new premises...
when you moving in?
I should be in within the week.
Cavendish Place.
And there will be a women's touch too.
- Oh, well that's marvellous.
- Indeed.
Good god!
- That was gunfire!
- No, no, no, no.
Hammer on nail, wasn't it?
My colleagues, probably just... putting up a painting.
I'll go and check.
- Your colleague? - Yes
He wont be moving with you, will he?
No, he wont.
Mrs. Hudson...
I wont go in there by myself. Not while he's got a gun in his hand!
You don't need to go in there at all.
Give me the paper. What will I do when you leave, Doctor?
He'll have the whole house down!
He just needs another case, that's all.
Couldn't you have a longer engagement?
I smell gunpowder. This is not right you know!
Not in a domestic environment.
Thank you, Captain Phillip.
Same time next week.
Come on, Captain.
It's quieter downstairs.
Mrs. Hudson?
Bring something to cheer him up.
Permission to enter the armoury.
Granted.
Watson, I am in the process of inventing a device that suppresses the sound of a gunshot.
It's not working.
- Oh. - Can I see that? You know it's been three months, since your last case?
Gently.
Gently, Watson. Be gentle with me.
Don't you think it's time you found another one.
I can't but, agree.
My mind is in a terrible condition, give me problems, give me work.
There's a letter here, from...
- Paper. - Thank you.
Let's see then.
Mrs. Ramsay, of Queenspark.
Her husband's disappeared.
He's in Belgium, with the scullery maid.
Is it November?
Yes, Holmes.
What?
Lady Rathford reports... her emerald bracelet has disappeared.
An insurance swindle.
Lord Rathford likes fast women and slow ponies.
I see you're the attending physician, at Blackwood's hanging.
Yes.
It was our last case together and I wanted to see it through to the end.
A Mr. Louis...
There's only one case, that intrigues me at present.
The Curious Case of Mrs. Hudson The absentee landlady.
I've been studying her comings and goings
- and they appear most... sinister.
- Tea, Mr. Holmes?
Is it poisoned, "Nanny"?
There's enough of that in you already.
Don't touch.
Everything is in it's proper place.
As per usual, "Nanny".
Oh, his killed the dog... again.
What have you done to, Gladstone now?
I was simply testing a new anaesthetic.
He doesn't mind.
Holmes, as your doctor...
He'll be straight as a trivet in no time. As your friend...
You've been in this room for two weeks. I insist, you have to get out.
There's nothing of interest, for me, out there on Earth. At all.
- So, you're free this evening? - Absolutely.
- Dinner?
- Wonderful.
- The Royal?
- My favourite.
Mary's coming.
- Not available.
- You're meeting her, Holmes!
Have you proposed yet?
No, I haven't found the right ring.
Well, then it's not official.
It's happening, whether you like it or not.
8:30, the Royal.
- Where a jacket.
- You wear a jacket.
- Holmes! - Hmm.
You're early.
Fashionably.
Miss Mary Morsten.
Oh my goodness. What a pleasure.
For the life of me, I don't know why it's taken him so long to introduce us properly.
The pleasure is mine.
It really is quite a thrill to meet you, Mr. Holmes.
I've heard so much about you.
I have a pile of detective novels at home...
Collins, Poe.
It's true.
It can seem a little far fetched though, at times.
That's not quite right is it?
In fact, the little details are by far, the most important.
- Take Watson...
- I intend to.
See his walking stick over there?
African snake wood.
Hiding a blade of high tensile steel.
Few were rewarded to the veterans of the Afghan war, so I can assume, he's a decorated soldier.
Strong, brave, born to be an adventurer.
and neat, like all military men.
Now, I check his pockets.
Ah, a stamp from a boxing match.
Now, I can infer that he's a bit of a gambler.
I'd keep an eye on that dowry, if I were you.
- Those days are behind me.
- Right, behind you.
It's cost us the rent, more than once.
Well with all due respect, Mr. Holmes, You know John very well.
What about a complete stranger?
What can you tell about me?
- You?
- I don't think that's...
- I don't know that, that's...
- Not at dinner.
- Perhaps another time.
- I insist.
- You insist?
- You remember we discussed this. The lady insists
- You're a governess.
- Well done.
Yes, well done.
Shall we...
Waiter!
Your student...
It's a boy of eight.
Charlie is seven, actually.
And he's tall for his age.
He flicked you with ink today.
- Is there ink on my face?
- There is nothing wrong with your face.
There are two drops on your ear in fact.
India blue is nearly impossible to wash off.
Anyway, very impetuous act of that boy, but you're too experienced to react rashly, which is why the lady for whom you work lent you that necklace.
Pearls, diamonds, flawless rubies.
Hardly the gems of a governess .
However, the jewels you are not wearing, tell us rather more.
- Holmes!
- You were engaged.
The ring has gone, but the lightness of the skin where it once sat suggests that you spent some time abroad, wearing it proudly that is, until you were informed of its true and rather modest worth and then you broke of the engagement and returned to, England
for better prospects.
A doctor perhaps?
You're right on all counts Mr. Holmes, apart from one.
I didn't leave him.
He died.
Well done, old boy.
Get up and fight!
Come on!
Come on!
That's it, big man...
We're done. You won.
Congratulations.
Oi, we ain't done yet.
This mustn't register on an emotional level.
First, distract target.
Then block his blind jab.
Counter with cross to the left cheek.
Discombobulate.
Dazed, he'll attempt a wild hay maker. employ the elbow block.
And body shot.
block thorough left. weaken right jaw.
Now fracture.
Break cracked ribs.
Traumatize, solar plexus.
Dislocate jaw entirely.
Heel kick to diaphragm.
In summary: jaw fractured, three ribs cracked four broken, diaphragm haemorrhaging.
Physical recovery: 6 weeks.
Full psychological recovery: 6 months.
Capacity to spit at back of head...
Neutralized.
Where did that come from?
What the hell's going on here, Charley?
Lord Blackwood's put him on some kind of spell, sir.
It's like he's burning from the inside out!
Shut up!
Charley.
Charley!
Take this man to the infirmary! Now!
What's this all about then, Blackwood?
There's someone I want to see.
- Watson? - Right.
Let's go.
What started merely as an experiment has brought me to the threshold of monumental discovery
Now if I play, chromatic scale there's no measurable response.
You do know, what you're drinking is meant for eye surgery.
But... now, and this is remarkable if I change to atonal clusters.
Voila! They fly in counter-clockwise, synchronized concentric circles.
As though a regimented flock.
Watson this is exceptional.
I, using musical theory, have created order out from chaos.
How did you lure them in?
Excellent question.
Individually, I've been at it for six hours.
And what happens if I do this?
Clean yourself up.
You are Blackwood's last request.
Look at those towering structures.
It's the first combination of a Bascule's suspension bridge ever attempted.
Most innovative.
What an industrious empire! Oh, I have your winnings from last night.
You weren't there, so I made your customary bet.
You're right.
I'll keep it with your chequebook, locked safely away in my draw.
Did you know the opera house is featuring "Don Giovanni"?
I could easily procure a couple of tickets
If you had any cultural inclinations this evening.
You have a grand gift of silence,
Watson, it makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
I knew she'd been engaged.
She told me.
So that's, no to the opera then.
That was my waistcoat.
I thought we agreed it's too small for you.
- I'd like it back.
- I thought we agreed.
I want it back. This way, Mr. Holmes.
Blackwood certainly seems to have got the crowd into something of a fear frenzy.
I'm sure it will disperse once his feet have stopped twitching.
Care to come along?
No, you're on your own, old cock.
I have no business with him whilst he's alive.
Suit yourself, "mother hen".
It seems you still have lots of rooms to let.
We had to move the prisoners, sir.
Otherwise we're gonna have a riot on our hands.
He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.
As though, he can get inside their heads.
I'm sure I can find my own way if you have other duties to perform.
Much obliged, sir.
Thank you.
And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy,
and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast they worshipped the beast saying,
Who is like the beast?
the beast which I just saw had the body of a leopard, but had feet of a bear and the mouth was the mouth of a lion.
The dragon gave his power unto the beast, and his seat and great authority.
I love what you've done with the place.
So glad you can accept my invitation.
I just have a small point of concern.
How can I help?
I've already followed the murders with some interest.
and although my heart went out primarily to the families of the victims
I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery, in the stroke of your brush.
You're too kind.
However, by comparison, your work in the crypt looks more like a finger painting.
So now you're curious if there's a larger game afoot?
Either that or, um... shortly my friend will pronounce you dead and I thought I might keep him company.
Your mistake is to imagine that anything that is earthly has led us to this moment.
Your error of judgement is to assume that I'm holding the brush at all.
I'm merely a channel.
Well my only wish is that I could have caught you sooner.
You see? Five lives might have been spared.
Those lives were a necessity.
Sacrifice.
Five otherwise meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose.
I wonder if they'll let me and Watson dissect your brain.
After you hang, of course.
I'd wager, there is some deformity that would be scientifically significant.
Then you too, could serve a greater purpose.
Holmes, you must widen your gaze.
I'm concerned, you underestimate the gravity of coming events.
You and I are bound together on a journey that would twist the very fabric of nature.
But beneath your mask of logic I sense a fragility...
That worries me.
Steel your mind, Holmes.
I need you.
I'd say, you've come a long way down from a house of Lords.
- I will rise again.
- "Bon voyage". Pay attention!
Three more will die and there is nothing you can do to save them.
You must accept that this is beyond your control.
by the time you realise you made all of this possible it will be the last sane thought in your head.
What did he want?
I'm not sure.
But I don't think you're needed father.
Not for this one.
Lord Henry Blackwood, you are sentenced to death for the practice of black magic the unholy murder of five innocent young women and an attempted murder of a sixth.
Do you have any final words?
Death... is only the beginning.
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.
London's so bleak this time of year.
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey, but much prefer to travel in the winter.
Here, I bought you these. All the way from Syria.
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan.
and your favorite... olives from the Cyclades.
I thought we might have a little tea party.
and while I was setting the table, I found this.
A file with my name on it.
"The theft of the Velásquez portrait from the King of Spain.
Missing naval documents lead to resignation of Bulgarian prime minister scandalous affair ends engagement of... perhaps to both Romanov princess.
I'm simply studying your methods.
Should the authorities ask me to hunt you down.
But I don't see my name in any of these articles.
But your signature was clear.
Is that the Maharajah's missing diamond?
Or just another souvenir?
Let's not dwell on the past.
Shall we?
Now, by the looks of things, I'd say you were between jobs.
And you between husbands. How much did you get for the ring?
He was boring and jealous and he snored.
I'm Irene Adler, again. Thank you. I need your help.
I need you to find someone.
Why are you always so suspicious.
Should I answer chronologically or alphabetically?
Careful not to cut yourself on this lethal envelope.
I think you'll find all the information inside.
Who are you working for?
So I'll have to find out the hard way.
Keep your money, I didn't say I'll take the case.
Well, consider it a wager that you will.
You remember the Grand?
They gave me our old room.
Hold the door.
Thank's, doctor.
Ma'am.
- He'll do it.
- Well done, Miss Adler.
That's precisely why I hired you.
I wager, he'll have our man in the next 24 hours.
He'd better.
Reordan is the key to what Blackwood was doing.
He's essential to my plan.
Damn!
What are you doing? Can't you see where you're going?
Get off out of it!
A little ride, I've come along way, sir.
Rubbing these calluses off this...
God save the queen! God save the Queen, sir.
Get off out of it!
Look at you?
Why is the only woman you've ever cared about a world class criminal?
Are you a masochist? Allow me to explain... Allow me!
She's the only adversary, who ever out smarted you. Twice.
Made a proper idiot out of you.
Right, you've had your fun.
- What she after, anyway?
- It's time to press on.
What could she possibly need?
It doesn't matter.
An alibi, a beard.
A human canoe.
She can sit on your back and paddle you up the Thames.
That's no consequence to you really, is it Watson?
We've done our, last case together.
I've already read it.
Missing person.
Luke Reordan. 4 foot 10, red hair, no front teeth.
Case solved.
You're obviously not her type.
She likes gingered dwarfs.
Midgets.
- So, you agree. - No, I don't agree.
It's more than a technicality, you see.
You are misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened peoples.
I've said too much.
I can tell, I've upset you.
No, I'm just simply stating, that one has...
What were you doing?
- Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.
- Holmes?
What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Are you wearing a false...
- A false nose?
No.
- Tell me, that, that wasn't
- Was...
Where are you going? Watson?
Help! Watson!
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.
Cut you a deal, cos you're so pretty.
Oh, my lucky day!
Hello gorgeous, you got something for me.
Don't move!
Now, what have we got here?
Thank you.
That's the Irene I know.
This man Intrigues me, Watson, His got Adler on the edge.
And she's no mean feet.
She's intimidated, she's scared of him.
Yet she work's for him.
Right.
It is nothing to do with me, but I advise you to leave the case alone.
I may not always have a choice.
After all, I may be paying the rent on my own soon. Thanks to you.
Get that out of my face.
It's not "in your face" it's in my hand.
Get what's in your hand out of my face.
- Clarky! Sorry. Inspector Lestrade asks you come with me at once.
What's he done now, lost his way to Scotland Yard?
Watson drop a compass, he means us.
No, you means you.
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He...
Well... it appears he's come back from the grave, sir.
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.
I pronounced the man dead myself.
What are the facts?
Ground keeper, claims he saw him walking through the graveyard just this morning, sir.
I'll leave this in your capable hands.
I have an appointment with, Mary.
It's not my reputation at stake here.
- Don't try that.
- Have the newspapers - got wind of it yet.
- Well that's what we're trying to avoid, sir.
Certainly.
- What's the major concern?
- Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.
Indeed.
You're not taking this seriously, Holmes?
Yes, as you should.
It's a matter of professional integrity.
No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell If a man's dead or not.
Who do you think won the match, Clarky?
- Sir?
- The rugby match.
Your boys have done a magnificent job of obliterating any potential evidence.
Yes, but at least they never miss an opportunity... to miss an opportunity.
You took your time, Holmes.
And on the third day...
These slabs are sand stone, they half a ton each if they're a pound, and they were smashed open from the inside .
Lestrade. What of the coffin?
We are in the process of bringing it up now.
I see...
Hmm... Right. At what stage of the process?
And how is our witness?
He's over there.
And apparently he's got ca...
cat... cata... Catatonic, sir.
- He's not feeling very well.
- Yes
If you lot don't stop behaving like a bunch of quivering milk maids, you're on double time.
Now you get down there, and you bring that coffin up, now!
Good day, sir!
It's alright.
I'm a doctor.
The man's in shock.
- He may need a few moments - The witness states that he saw, lord Blackwood, rise from the grave.
- Well?
- Well? You pronounced him dead.
He had no pulse.
That's not Blackwood.
Well, now we have a firm grasp, of the obvious.
Time of death?
Diptera is approximately... 2/3 of an inch which would put the time of death at between 10 and 12 hours ago.
May I borrow your pen?
- Adler's dwarf.
- Midget.
I know what I saw!
It was Blackwood!
As clear as I see you.
And when the dead walk... the living will fill these coffins.
Well... Umm... Right, put the lid on and clean this lot up.
You really believe he was resurrected?
The question is not "if" but "how." The game's afoot.
Follow your spirit and upon this charge, cry god for Harry, England and St. George.
Here you are.
Why that certain fish and chips store
- I don't understand - Well there's a particular pier they use out in the back, northern stout, to be exact.
You know, Holmes
I've seen things in war I don't understand.
In India, I once met a man who predicted his own death right down to the number and placement of the bullets that killed him.
You have to admit, Holmes that a supernatural explanation to this case, is theoretically possible.
No. Agreed.
But, it is a huge mistake to theorize before one has data.
Inevitably, one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts
That said I believe our midget is the key to this.
Right.
Scratches around the keyhole where the watch is wound.
What does that tell you?
The man was likely a drunk.
Every time he wound the watch, his hand slipped, hence the scratches.
Yes Very good, Watson.
You have developed considerable deductive powers of your own. Let's see now.
There are several sets of initials.
- Pawn brokers marks.
- Excellent. Most recent of which are:
M.H. M.H. M.H...
- M.H is for...
- "Maddison and Haig".
They should be able to give us an address.
What a coincidence.
There's one thing you failed to deduce from the watch, Holmes.
Really?
I think not.
The time.
I have to get back, Holmes.
Taking tea with the in-laws..
- Can I predict your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.
No thank you, ma'am.
You need to hear what I have to tell you. We have no need of your lucky hella Gypsy women.
Even if it's to do with Mary.
I see two men.
Brothers.
Not in blood, but in boned.
What of Mary?
M for Mary, for marriage.
Oh, you will be married.
Go on.
I see patterned table cloths and china figurines.
and lace doilies... doilies...
Lace doilies... Holmes.
- Does your depravity know, no bounds?
- No.
Oh she turns fat and has a beard...
And what of the warts?
- Oh She's covered in warts... - Enough, enough.
- Are they extensive?
- Please, enough!
It's the most apt prediction, Flora's made in years.
And precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring.
Do you have my money?
You are terrified of a life without the thrill of a macabre.
Do you have my cut?
- Admit it, admit it!
- Give me my money!
Holmes.
Oh I see.
Thank you.
Well you've got your ring, and I've got the address for the ginger midget.
Should be just there.
I think she'll really like this.
And I have some change in my pocket.
- Should I look after it for you? - No, no.
- Don't give it away here.
- No! I have to go see Mary.
Give her my best.
And the family as well.
It does make a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely.
Well, you can rely on me for exactly 10 minutes.
He clearly felt something was coming to get him.
Or something did.
Irene Adler was here, either that or the ginger midget wore the same Parisian perfume.
Ah, putrefaction.
Ammonium sulphate, among other aromas. Phosphorus.
Formaldehyde.
It looks like he was attempting to combine some kind of sorcery and scientific formula.
More importantly... let's see what he was trying to dispose of.
Potassium and magnesium.
Sultafitic acid. Try to take the ion out of the ink As long as it's not too burnt.
Peculiar.
Hydrated rhododendron. Holmes.
Look at the crest.
Reordan was working with, Blackwood.
Of course he was.
Question is, to what end.
You alright? Holmes.
How so?
Otherwise, he'd still alive.
Which is why Miss Adler is so desperate to find him.
Yes.
There's one odour I can't quite put my finger on.
Is it candy floss? Molasses.
Maple syrup.
Ah, barley sugar.
Toffee apple.
Let me guess.
Judging by your arsonist tool kit
You're here to burn down the building and extinguish all the evidence therein
Just one minute boys..
Oh, Dredger!
Is there a problem?
Meat... or potatoes?
My 10 minutes are up.
What is that? Holmes!
Watson...
What have you done?
I haven't slept all night.
Not a whink.
Why I ever believed... that I would get to have tea with Mary's parents?
is beyond me having been talked into going with you. We were set upon man, it was self-defence. I've been reviewing my notes, of our exploits over the last seven months.
would you like to know my conclusion?
I am psychologically disturbed.
How so?
Why else would I be continually led into situations where you deliberately, withhold your plans from me?
Why else? You never complained about my methods before.
- I'm not complaining.
- What do you call this?
- How... How am I complaining?
I never complain, when do I ever complain about you practising the violin at three in the morning.
or your mess, your general lack of hygiene or the fact that you steal all my clothes.
We have a barter system.
When do I complain about you setting fire to my room?
- Our rooms.
- The rooms, When do I ever complain that you experiment on my dog?
- Our dog!
It's our dog. - On the... the dog!
But I do take issue, is your campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary.
I understand.
- Do you? - I do.
- I don't think you do.
- You're overly tired.
- Yes.
- You're feeling a bit sensitive.
I'm not sensitive. What you need is to rest.
My brother, Mycroft, has a small estate near Chichester.
Beautiful grounds... There's a falling. - We could throw a lamb on the spit...
- We? Holmes, if I were to go to the country it would be with my future wife.
Well certainly, if you must...
No not you, Mary and I.
- You are not...
- What? Invited? Why would I be not invited to my own brothers country home, Watson?
- Now you are not making any sense!
- You're not human!
- John Watson?
Your ball has been posted.
Mary!
Just Watson.
I hope you get bail by breakfast, because the boys, are getting hungry. Back off!
Back off!
To which the barman says: "may I push in your stool?". Right you, you're out..
- Until next time, big Joe.
- Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes.
Thank heaven you're here, Lestrade I'd almost ran out of jokes.
You know, In another life, you'd have made an excellent criminal.
Yes, sir and you an excellent policemen. Tomsky! Thank you.
Now please tell me you have answers.
All in good time, Lestrade.
All in good time? what is this some parlour game where we have to guess what you're thinking.
I've got a public in frenzy out there and if you don't fill me in, I'll have you in there playing Victoria and Albert quicker than a bookies runner Now, clean up and make yourself presentable.
For whom? Friends in high places. They're the ones who bailed you out.
I'm terribly sorry to inconvenience you, sir. But I'm going to have to put this on you.
Mr. Holmes, apologies for summoning you like this.
I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are and who I am?
As to where I am...
I was admittedly lost for a moment, between Charing Cross and Holborn, but I was saved by the bread shop on Southford Hill.
The only baker to use the certain French glaze on their loaves a Brittany sage.
after that the carriage fork left and right until a tell-tale bump at the Fleet conduit.
that took every ounce of my not inconsiderable experience.
The letters on your desk were addressed to a Sir Thomas Rodrum.
Lord Chief Justice. That would be the official title
Who you really are... is of course another matter entirely.
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring.
you're the secret head of the Temple of the Four Orders in who's headquarters we now sit.
Located, Northwest corner of St. James square I think.
That's the mystery, the only mystery is to why you bothered to blind fold me at all.
Yes... well, standard procedure I suppose.
I dare say we have the right man, gentlemen.
Sherlock Holmes.
I'm Ambassador Standish of America and Lord Coward, the home secretary.
I suppose you already have some notion as to the practices of our order.
Yes.
They are practically interesting.
Be as sceptical as you like.
but our secret system have steered the world for the greater good for centuries.
There danger is they can also be used for more nefarious purposes.
What some call the dark arts or practical magic.
We know you don't believe in magic Mr. Holmes
We don't expect you to share our faith merely our fears.
fear is the more infectious condition.
In this instance.
fear of your own child.
Blackwood is your son
You have the same irises, a rare dark green, the diamond shaped hazel flex together with identical outer ears or pinner, which are only past down through direct blood line which makes by necessity either brothers or in this case, more likely father and son.
Very few people are privy to that information.
And we'd want to keep it that way.
He was conceived during one of our rituals.
His mother wasn't my wife.
But she shared our beliefs. She was a powerful practitioner.
though not enough to survive giving birth to him.
Death followed him wherever he went.
Those five girls were not the first to be butchered.
He killed many more using them to enhance his powers.
No one could prove anything of course, but we all knew.
The boy was a curse.
We'd done our best to stop him ourselves, but its not enough.
His power grows daily.
His resurrection is evidence of that.
But what he does next will be far more dangerous.
The secret lies in the book of spells.
This is the source of his power.
His going to raise a force that will alter the very course of the world.
I want you to find him and stop him before he does.
We'll give you any assistance that we can.
As home secretary, I have a considerable influence over the police.
- Oh, yes
- So...
Name your price?
Well, of great benefit to being a consulting detective is that I can pick and choose my clients.
Consider it done, I'll stop him.
But not for you.
And certainly not for a price.
I do have a parting query Sir Thomas.
What is that? If the rest of his family's dead... how long do you expect to survive?
Food for thought.
Well perhaps you'll have better luck opening that.
Margaux. 58.
Comet vintage.
How fascinating that a astronomical event can effect the quality...
How is it going with our case that you refused to take.
...wine.
Or I've hit a dead end. Literally.
I found your man.
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.
If you still need him.
Oh dear...
I hope my client doesn't come looking for a refund.
He's a professor, isn't he?
I couldn't see his face, but I spotted a bit of chalk on his apparel.
I've never known a professor to carry a gun, and on such a clever contraption.
Eye patch.
So... case closed.
Which makes this a social visit.
No. It's you're in over your head Irene, visit.
Who ever killed, Reardon was covering their tracks, which makes you the next loose end to be snipped.
Let it breathe.
I've never been in over my head.
Leave now, disappear.
You're good at that.
Or stay. And volunteer for protective custody.
If I'm in danger, so are you.
Come with me.
What if we trusted each other.
I'm taking you, to either the railway station or the police station.
So...
Which is it to be?
You decide, which will it be?
I told you to let it breathe.
Can you taste the comet?
Why couldn't you just come away with me?
Madam, I need you to remain calm, and trust me, I'm a professional.
Of course, she misinterpreted my intention entirely.
- Naturally sir.
- That's why I find this modern religious fellow so troubling.
There's no latitude for misunderstandings.
It runs right over reason, sir.
And chambermaids were once such a liberal breed.
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.
Anyhow, it's a good thing she was a friend, otherwise we may never have found you.
The inspector's been over at Baker Street himself this morning, sir.
Just joking about the wife, sir.
We've checked everything.
There's no sign of a break in and the butler didn't hear a thing.
So, body in the bath tub, his eyes were wide open and the only thing missing was...
His ring, sir.
Why did you drain the water?
Out of common decency.
Crime is common. Logic, is rare.
The decent thing to do is to catch the killer, not provide conflict for the cause.
What is that? Jasmine bath salt, sir.
Super.
Probably comes from a larger container.
It would either be in the pantry.
High up where it's warm and dry. Or in a linen cupboard with a vent.
Oh and constable, you could do worse than to check the ground under the rear window for any signs of footprints not your own data, data, data.
I can not make bricks without clay.
Charles?
It was in the pantry, sir.
I don't know what to make of this.
Excellent work.
Sir Thomas is dead.
I nominate Lord Blackwood as head of the Order. Have you lost your mind?
You know damn well what his capable of.
Of course he does.
That's why we're here.
That's why, we're all here.
My powers and my assets were given to me for one purpose.
Magnificent, but a simple purpose.
To create a new future.
A future ruled... by us.
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step towards a new chapter in our history.
Magic will lead the way.
Once the people of England see our new found power they'll bow down in fear.
Across the Atlantic, lies a colony that was once ours.
It will be again.
The civil war has made them weak.
Their government is as corrupt and as ineffective as ours.
So we'll take it back.
We will remake the world.
Create the future.
These men are with me, Standish.
But... are you?
No, sir.
I am not.
These powers that you're playing with... no man, can control.
Someone has to stop them even if you won't.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Gentlemen... don't be afraid.
As you can see, we are protected.
Come... drink your allegiance here.
You control the police, now use them.
I didn't know you were here.
Since this room is no longer yours, do you mind if I utilise it?
Be my guest.
- In here chaps.
- Where shall we put him, sir?
Any where's fine.
Who is he?
His the man who tried to kill you at Reardon's lodgings.
I suppose his neck didn't survive the impact of Dredger landing on him.
Yes...
Thanks for that by the way.
But there is still some consolation in the knowledge that he can still be of service to his fellow man.
Elbow is long stained with blood. But it's older than his own injuries.
I don't know if it's human.
It's not a butcher. Let me see...
Yellow Flame. Green bursts.
An industrial worker. Coal.
River silt.
And the stains on his trousers, should put him squarely in...
Nine Elms.
Sorry what?
The area you're looking for is, Nine Elms.
Do you remember where I put the Lord's registrar of members interests?
It's on the step ladder.
Blackwood has had his hand in almost everything that is corrosive to the spirit.
Woolidge Arsenal.
Lime house Chemical Works.
Probably be a factory by the river.
What's that?
Never mind.
You don't know where my rugby ball went do you?
No, not a clue.
Queen side slaughterhouse Nine Elms.
A factory by the river. Well done, Watson.
That should lead us right to Blackwood.
Dead or Alive.
Not us.
You.
Yes...
Just a figure of speech, old boy.
He's left it there on purpose. More coal doctor.
That's a good one.
Glad to see you two are working hard then.
And I thought you were trying to be discrete.
You would not last one day in the navy.
Holmes, are you sure that there is no alternative means of water transportation, than that.
I guarantee you nobody knows London's waterways better.
Tanners practically a fish himself.
At least he certainly drinks like one.
Oh you've found a sense of humour, doctor.
If only just a sense.
I better take over. A bit tricky down here.
Come on...
- Look familiar?
- Yep.
All that's missing is a ginger midget.
They cleared something away from here. Not minutes ago.
Like what?
I'm not sure. Something mechanical.
Holmes, look at this.
- 1:18
- Chapter and verse.
Revelations. 1:18.
I am he that giveth, and was dead.
And behold of the life for ever more.
I warned you, Holmes to accept that this was beyond your control.
beyond what your rational mind could comprehend
What a busy afterlife that you are having.
I want you to bear witness.
Tomorrow, at midday, the world as you know it, will end.
Show me your face and it will be the end of your world right now.
Save the bullets, Watson.
A gift for you.
What was that about saving bullets? She followed you here, Holmes.
You led your lamb to slaughter.
Holmes!
This game was designed to hurt.
Watson!
It's warm in here, Watson!
In over your head yet, darling?
- Hold on there!
- I can't.
Let me take your weight.
Give us a leg up, old boy.
No matter. We have plenty of time.
Holmes...
- It's not working.
Holmes! Hurry up.
Hope you're not getting excited... Turn of that valve.
And we bounce in...
Three ...two, ...one.
Thank you.
I'm gonna get after, Blackwood.
Thank you.
We should go help the doctor.
Holmes!
Lord.
Watson's alive.
Just get out of here, sir. Go.
The trains been delayed, madam.
Shouldn't be long now though.
The train will depart when I tell it too.
And you will leave my employment, when I allow you too.
I fulfilled my contract.
I found Reorden.
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.
So that's me finished.
Your job was to manipulate, Holmes' feelings for you.
Not succumb to them.
You have fulfilled nothing.
I want what, Reardon was making for Blackwood.
finish the job, or the next dead body will be Sherlock Holmes.
The surgeon should be along shortly.
He should be able to rest now.
Excuse me.
Is that the best you can do?
Yes for now.
I must attend to my other patients.
Doctor...
Doctor!
Please!
I know that you care for him as much as I do.
This is not your responsibility, It was his choice.
He'd say it was worth the wounds. Solve this.
Whatever it takes. It's Lord Blackwood, sir. I've never been in over my head.
It's nothing to do with me, but I'd advise you to leave the case alone.
You're not taking this seriously are you, Holmes.
I told you to accept, this was beyond your control
Tomorrow at mid-day, the world will end.
Holmes.
You and I are bound together on a journey that will twist the very fabric of nature.
Steel your mind, Holmes.
He will raise a force that will change the very course of the world.
His power grows.
This is the source of his power.
I need you.
The secret lies in the book of spells.
Three more will die... and there's nothing you can do to save them.
We know you don't believe in magic.
Reardon was working with Blackwood.
The only thing missing was his ring.
Give up, Holmes.
This is a riddle you can not solve.
Good morning.
Now, you need to work.
Familiar artwork?
You look gorgeous.
Some how, I knew you wouldn't leave.
You made the front page. Only a name, and no picture?
So it looks like, you'll be needing to work outside the law now, and that's my area of expertise.
I feel safer already.
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.
Yes...
I took this shrapnel out myself.
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.
Well I'm...
I'm just so... very glad that you're um... well, with us.
Now that you're sitting comfortably, I shall begin.
My initial approach was far to narrow.
When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville prison he suggested I widen my gaze.
and at minimum, I have done just that.
In fact, I may well have reconciled thousand's of years of theological disparity.
But that's for another time.
Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system that's been employed by the Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.
To fully understand the system, to get inside it,
I re-enacted the ceremony we interrupted at the crypt, with a few enhancements of my own.
my journey took me some what further down the rabbit hole than I intended and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail
The fraternity who decidedly control the empire who share the belief with the kings, Pharaohs, and emperors of old that the Sphinx was a door to another dimension.
A gateway to immeasurable power.
It's made up of four parts.
The foot of a lion, the tail of an ox, the wings of an eagle and the head of a man.
In Sir Thomas's secret chamber, I found a bone of an ox the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle and a hair of a man.
Map.
The points of the stars represent the five murdered girls but the cross is what we're now interested in.
It's a wildly held belief, that within the architecture of the great cities are coded references to the system
Since he rose from the grave, Blackwood's killed three men.
Each murder was committed at a location that has a direct connection with the temple therefore the system.
Reardon, the ginger midget.
represents man. We found his body here.
Sir Thomas... master of the temple, wore the ox ring.
He died here.
Standish, the ambassador to America Where the eagle has been the national emblem for over a hundred years .
The headquarters of the Temple of the Four Order is where he died, is here.
Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act
So we have man, the ox, eagle, only the lion remaining.
Right here.
Parliament.
Alright you four stay here and the rest of you come with me.
Right this way.
Ladies first.
Follow these instructions.
Hello, hello, hello...
Did the devil turn up?
Well never mind.
You've got the next best thing.
Beg your pardon my lord, I know that it's unorthodox
But Mr. Holmes here, his been making some serious accusations about you and The Order.
I see.
At least this solves the great mystery of how you became inspector. Excuse me, my lord.
But I've been wanting to do that for a long time.
Well inspector, I have five minutes before my next engagement.
So why don't you regale me with your stories of conspiracy
Thank you Lestrade.
My lord...
I'm curious, Coward.
Did you assist Blackwood in all his murders.
or just the one I prevented?
Very distinctive, those hand made shoes of yours.
But the price of quality is often the unique imprint they leave
Nonetheless I confess to being completely outmatched.
I could deduce very little from my investigation.
Fortunately there's nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you.
How many members of parliament do you intend to murder at noon today.
Man, ox, eagle, lion.
The lion's parliament isn't it?
Very clever.
But it's not murder, Mr. Holmes.
It's mercy.
We are giving the weak masses a strong Shepard.
Don't you see that it's for their own...
No. But I don't care much what you think.
I just simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood's final ceremony.
And now you've given it to me.
I've told you nothing.
But your clothes say infinitely more than you could ever hope.
The mud smeared on your boots from where you've been walking.
A touch of red brick dust on your knee from where you've been kneeling.
A small bandage on your thumb from where you've been vowing.
A faint aroma of excrement from where you've been standing.
You and Blackwood laid the final touches to your ceremony in the sewers beneath parliament less than an hour ago.
Both houses meet today.
The whole government will be present.
It's a shame you made an enemy out of Blackwood, Holmes.
You would have made a valuable ally.
How terrible is wisdom.
when it brings no profit to the wise.
We take power at noon.
Then isn't anytime to waste then.
I told you you he'd be coming out the top window, soldier boy.
There isn't any way he'd be coming over that terrace.
Technically that isn't the top window, is it sailor boy.
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.
Anyway, you'd be pleased to know that Lestrade performed in his role perfectly.
Actually, I think he rather enjoyed it.
I hope you know what you're doing, Holmes.
Here's the key.
You got what you needed from, Coward?
Yes, I smoked him out with relative ease.
- Tanner?
- Yes?
If you would captain, take us onto the bridge
Port side. proximately 100 yards beyond that you'll find a tunnel, that leads us to the sewers.
Right away, sir. The end is nigh.
Blackwood's come back from hell and laid a curse upon this land
Behold, Blackwood's magic revealed.
What does it do?
The first of its kind.
You deduced that, how?
From my pocket.
I snipped this of a rather common rat at the slaughterhouse.
Notice the blue discolouration.
The faintest smell of almonds, tell-tale traces of cyanide.
Now we know what the ginger midget was working on.
- It will revolutionise warfare.
- Yes killing a lot of people.
Now, there's 7 minutes until noon.
We must do this carefully...
She loves an entrance, your muse.
Shoot him!
My lords! My lords.
Time has come for any of those who believe, to remain.
Behold...
Lord Blackwood. You seem surprised.
I have returned from beyond the grave to fulfil England's destiny.
and extend the boundaries of this great empire. Listen to the rabble outside.
Listen... to the fear.
I will use that as a weapon to control them... and then the world.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's specifically designed to prevent us from disarming it.
These components appear to be designed to receive a signal of some sort.
Electromagnetic waves?
When triggered, the electrodes will send a charge converting the chemical into gas.
and the gas will travel up that shaft and filter through the ventilation system that leads directly to parliament.
Within seconds, of it's administration the most powerful men in the world will be choking on death.
Blackwood must have some sort of transmitter that connects with it remotely.
Three minutes and ten seconds. I will create an empire that will endure for a millennia
Indestructible and eternal.
Move it!
Move it!
We don't have to actually disarm the device, we just have to remove the cylinders.
Yes.
Except that they're welded in. What we need is a controlled explosion.
We need a container to direct the blast my clay pipe should service that ambition I rather wish you hadn't done that, Irene.
All others will perish.
I need your pipe.
Nut him!
A new order... begins now.
What are you waiting for?
That.
- Can you manage?
- Of course I can.
Relax.
I'm a doctor. Did you take a wrong turning somewhere?
We're safe now.
Interesting assessment.
Run off.
I won't be chasing you any more.
Fare thee well.
I don't want to run any more.
I'll tell you everything.
No!
There was never any magic.
Only conjuring tricks.
The simplest involves paying people off.
Like the prison guard who pretended to be possessed outside you cell.
Your reputation and the inmates fear did the rest.
Others required more elaborate preparations.
It was sandstone slab that covered your tomb.
you had it broken before your burial then put back together using a mild adhesive.
An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe.
A mixture of egg and honey, besides it'd be washed away by the rain.
Holmes!
Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub required more modern science.
Very clever of, Reordan to find a paralytic that was activated by the combination of copper and water.
and therefore was undetectable once the bath water was drained.
It might have been quite a challenge for me, had he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibian.
The death of Standish was a real mystery until you used the same compound, to blow up the wharf.
An odourless, tasteless flammable liquid yet it burned with an unusual pink issue.
Did Standish mistake it for rain as he entered the temple.
All it took was a spark.
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.
Ingenious.
Like all great performers, you saved your pièce de résistance for the end.
A chemical weapon, distilled from cyanide. and refined in the bellies of swine.
Had it worked, your followers in parliament would have watched unharmed as their colleagues were dying around them.
They didn't know that you'd given them the antidote.
Instead they would have believed it was magic.
and that you'd harnessed the ultimate power.
and the world would have followed. Fear, in the most powerful weapon of all. You'd better hope that it's nothing more than superstition, as you performed all the rituals perfectly.
The devil's due a soul, I'd say.
For god's sake, Holmes cut me loose! First, the world will see you for what you are.
A fraud.
Then you'll be hanged, properly this time.
It's a long journey from here to the rope. I've never woken up in handcuffs before.
I have.
Naked. A storm is coming.
Well... we've still got a moment.
- Moriarty...
- What?
That's his name.
And he is a professor.
Everyone has a weak spot.
And he found mine.
What was it precisely?
Please don't underestimate him.
He's just as brilliant as you are.
and infinitely more devious.
We'll see about that.
You'll miss me, Sherlock?
Sadly... yes.
- Afternoon, sir.
I put the notebook in this one, sir.
- Thank you.
What's in these, John?
- Scribbles.
- Scribbles?
- Notes. - They're your adventures!
Come on, what's wrong? I think his finally come to terms with you leaving?
Mary, look at the ring his given us.
Now 5 minutes here, and we'll go home.
Our home.
Careful on the stairs. Don't worry, dear. Suicide is not in his repertoire.
He's far to fond of himself for that.
Holmes!
Good afternoon.
I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution.
Clearing your good name, as it were.
But it had a surprising Soporific effect on me, and
I was carried off in the arms off, Morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon.
Good afternoon, dear.
Get on with it, Holmes.
Cleverly concealed in the hang-mans knot, was a hook
Oh dear, I think my legs have fallen asleep I should probably come down.
John, shouldn't we help him down?
No, no, no, I'd hate to cut him off midstream.
Well the executioner attached it to a harness.
Thus lowering the weight contributed around the waist and the neck to remain intact.
Oh my lord, I can't feel my cheeks.
Might we continue this at ground level?
How did you manage it, Holmes?
I managed it with braces, belts and a coat hook.
Please, Watson, my tongue is going and I'll be of no use to you at all.
- Worse things could happen.
None of this, explains Blackwood's lack of pulse
Right.
Now the medical mystery.
We must restore your reputation, Watson.
There is a toxin refined from the nectar of rhododendron ponticum.
It's quite infamous in the region of Turkey, bordering the Black Sea, for it's ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis.
Enough to mislead a medical mind even as tenacious and well-trained as your own.
It's known locally as...
What's wrong with Gladstone?
Mad honey's disease. His demonstrating the very effects that I just described.
He doesn't mind.
Mary don't worry.
he's seen far worse. Mr. Holmes?
Doctor, Miss Mary...
Sorry. Inspector Lestrade asks you come with me right away.
What is it this time, Clarky?
It's one of our sergeants, sir.
He went missing in the sewers the day, you stopped Lord Blackwood.
I'm afraid the sewage workers found his body just this morning, sir
We believe the sergeant, was our first man on the scene...
Can I help you, officer?
Shot in the head.
Was it a small calibre bullet?
Yes.
Was there powder burns on his eyebrows?
Indeed, sir.
Point blank range.
Moriarty.
Professor Moriarty.
There's a good boy!
Everything's gonna be fine.
Where is Blackwood's device now?
Secret Service have it, sir.
They've taken over the case.
I'd wager, there's a piece missing.
So Moriarty was after a piece of the machine.
Not the poison.
There's nothing more elusive than an obvious fact.
The wire free invention was the game all along.
And Adler was just the diversion.
He knew I'd chase after her, there by leaving the machine accessible.
The technology of that kind can be worth, an untold fortune.
Imagine being able to control a radio device simply by sending a command via radio waves.
It's the future, Watson. I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.
- Well...
- Well...
Gladstone!
Stop him before he gets to the front door.
Clarky?
Case reopened.
- Yes, sir.
- Where are you?
We're making a U-turn and we're on our way.
Let's get ready.
Yes, sir.
Two in the front, the rest block the stairs.
Jump him as a group.
He's one strong bastard.
I told you we should call for backup.
- You scared?
- Of course not.
Let's hurry and finally end this two-month stakeout.
He's in.
Hurry! .
Grab the big guy, but let the kid go.
Make sure you see him deliver it.
Hello?
It's been delivered.
- You can't go in, sir.
- Let go of me!
Stay still!
Stay still, asshole.
I got the goods.
I'll leave right now.
Bear is on the move.
What do I do?
- You sure about the delivery?
- I saw it!
- Why isn't he coming out?
- I told you, I saw it myself!
Do I jump him or not?
Once he's out the door, it's all over!
Sir!
Sir!
Get him.
Mother fucker!
Stay still!
Goddamn it!
Fucking bastard!
Grab him!
Teddy bear!
Let's go.
We got snacks for you at the station.
Mother fucker.
He got away.
- Ran with the goods.
- Fuck!
Don't get so worked up.
Those little pricks.
Crazy bitch.
You squeeze it, you buy it.
What do you need?
Come out.
Or I'll kill you.
I didn't steal your milk.
I'm not lying.
I don't steal anymore.
Hey, flowers!
You know Yong-chul, right?
I saw him in the bathroom and I was so embarrassed.
The kids asked if I liked him, but why would I?
And look, my tooth is shaky.
Does it hurt when you pull your tooth out?
Huh?
Mister?
Why do I bother?
I'm too old to pull my tooth out.
I don't want to.
Why only a dollar?
You owed me fifty cents.
But I put in a lot of new songs.
- You have bad taste in music.
- How mean.
Give that back for a second.
Sausage!
I like sausage too.
What are you saving up for?
Ta-da!
Nail art.
I'm the best in my class.
Should I do yours?
A lot of men do it these days.
Are you really a gangster?
They say you're hiding because you did something bad.
And Mom warned me that you're a child molester.
What?
Do you think I'm a bad guy, too?
Well...
You do look like the prison type.
- JUNG So-mi!
Are you in there?
- It's Mom!
I'm not here.
Hey, mister!
Open the door!
Mister, is So-mi here?
- She's not here.
- I heard voices inside.
Why won't you open the door then?
JUNG So-mi, I know you're in there!
Get out here, now!
Open the door.
I said, open it.
What are you doing?
JUNG So-mi.
You better come out right now!
What...
She's really not here?
I'm warning you.
Stop luring my kid in here.
If you touch her, I'll kill you.
You can go screw married women, but don't mess with kids.
I'll rip your balls off.
If you're that desperate, then ask me out.
You're easy on the eyes.
I'd date you.
Well?
Pussy.
Isn't it pretty?
Don't touch other people's things.
You had fun?
Tell your boss that I'll get his ass.
Good luck with that shit.
You lost all the goods I gave you.
Did you think I'd go hire you a private eye?
I sent my boys after it.
I'll find those bitches...
This is why you scumbags can't be trusted.
Goddamn useless developing country idiots.
Who brought this fucker?
Fucking Vietcong.
160 million Chinese do weed, 26 on meth, and 11 on heroin.
It's a gold mine.
The UN says so.
Three days,
I'll hold those Chinese here.
You better find that sample heroin.
Or I'll donate you two to the Bodies exhibition.
That's your specialty, so you get my drift.
A military in power is what this damn country needs.
You fucking little whore!
Are you crazy?
Where are the goods?
Answer me.
I did all the work.
I deserve half.
- Don't I?
- Fucking bitch!
Listen up, Hyo-jung.
20 percent is enough.
You have one day.
Don't bullshit me.
I can just sell it all and run!
You're asking for it, aren't you?
Do you know who they are?
Don't fuck it up.
Fucking tramp.
Like mother, like daughter.
Go outside and play.
I promise.
I'll go when Mom's friends leave.
You know what your nickname is?
The "pawnshop ghost".
Guess my nickname.
What is it?
I'm not telling.
It's "garbage".
My aunt told me,
Mom kicked a garbage can when she got pregnant with me.
It's been garbage ever since.
Funny, right?
Go to sleep.
Pawnshop ghost and garbage.
Sounds like a rock band.
Doesn't it?
I feel like playing video games...
I DIDN'T HAVE MY SUPPLIES, BUT ISN'T IT STILL CUTE?
KIM YEON-SU
What's wrong with you?
What's your mom's phone number?
- Answer me!
- Stop hitting her so much!
Look at my son's scars!
You can't even keep these bums away, with all the taxes I'm paying?
Did your mom tell you to glare at adults?
Did you steal his bag?
I didn't steal it.
I just wanted to compare it with mine.
You don't have a bag, you bum!
Don't touch!
You'll get germs!
You need an adult here to settle this.
Isn't your mom home?
That's your dad?
Excuse me, sir!
- Sir!
- Over here!
Hey!
He's not your dad?
Hello?
- Where are you?
- Woah.
Sounds like he really beat you hard.
You're smoking it up while I'm out working.
- Mom and Dad would be proud
- Not so hard...
That's just life.
Do-chi called.
He found the bitch.
Who?
The fucking dancer?
Are you mad?
That's why you shouldn't steal.
How much is what she just took?
Leave her be.
Kids will learn from their mistakes.
Parenting isn't just giving birth.
She's always by herself.
Bring her around more often, like the other dads.
It's on me.
Give me back my MP3.
I don't have money, so take this.
My lucky card.
It beats everything.
Bye.
DARK KNIGHT
Mister?
I embarrass you too, right?
That's why you ignored me?
It's okay.
My teacher and all the kids do that, too.
Mom said that if I get lost,
I should forget our address and phone number.
She gets drunk and says we should die.
Even though that pig called me a bum...
You're meaner.
But I don't hate you.
Because if I do, I won't have anyone I like.
Thinking about it hurts me here.
So I won't hate you.
Mom?
We're looking for something.
You're going to help us.
Do I look like a fucking school bully?
Get out.
Did you find it?
The thing is...
Things got a bit interesting up here.
- Who are you?
- You came to the wrong place.
I didn't call the cops, so just go.
How thoughtful of you.
We'll go once we get our goods.
PARK Hyo-jung gave you a camera bag yesterday.
Hand it over.
A day is worth half-month interest.
80 dollars capital and 4 percent interest.
Deals must be made in person.
Is that so?
I had no idea.
But what will we do?
Get over here.
Say something!
- Mom!
- Talk!
- Don't!
Stop it!
- Go ahead, talk!
- You little bitch!
- Mommy!
Are you okay?
Mommy!
Wake up, Mom!
Mommy!
She can't go right now.
How much?
You want these two to die for that?
Fucking...
Mister!
Mister!
Save me!
Mister!
Mister...
You couldn't handle one fucking guy?
Boxing?
Karate?
Was he that good?
I'm telling you, you should've seen him.
He was so fucking fast.
Don't you think...
- Forget it.
- No big deal.
This is good.
We needed a fall guy anyway.
You're saying...
Your neighbor and her kid got kidnapped by drug dealers?
Is that right?
- Yes.
- Is she really your neighbor?
Just give me your address.
I'll send a squad car.
Hello?
You can't give me your address, can you?
Look, sir.
If you're that lonely, call information instead.
They have prettier voices, all right?
I'll do as you say.
Don't hurt them.
You made the right choice, mister.
You just have to do one delivery for us.
- What do you think?
- Impressive.
Open the glove box.
OUT OF ORDER
Go to the driving range and ask for OH Myung-kyu.
Deliver it at 6 P.M. Be on time.
Toss the phone once I hang up.
When will you let them go?
There's a soup place around the corner.
I got a table at 9 P.M., so look there.
Look at these petty thieves.
- Where's the murder, the meat?
- You wish.
Fuck my life.
This is NOH, DEA department.
That's right.
Welcome.
Come this way.
Over here.
Nice to meet you.
- Was that right?
- Yes.
- Good.
- Have a seat.
- He came alone?
- Yes, sir.
These Chinese got spunk, don't they?
Hurry up, then.
Tell him it's imported and I hope he likes it.
Be polite.
Dandy, you hear?
Yes, sir.
Go on!
Saw some gangster films, eh?
May as well be at a funeral.
- Should I translate?
- If you want to die.
Does he think it's poisoned?
Try the goddamn tea.
Are you OH Myung-kyu?
I delivered it as promised.
Hand them over.
What is this?
- Who the hell sent you?
- I made the delivery.
- Keep your word.
- What is he saying?
Did you get the goods?
Man-seok?
You trying to dump this shit on me?
Why not?
You thought I'd just let you take my business?
You think you'll get away with this?
Mr. OH.
Mister fucking OH Myung-kyu.
One word of advice.
Kiss all the ass you can, but you're fucked.
You got that, bitch?
If you want to live, then run!
You fucking gold mother fucker!
Mother fucker!
Hey, Chinese major.
There goes your paycheck!
You fucker!
Get over here!
Grab him!
What the fuck?
Get my jacket!
Goddamn bastards.
Hey!
Throw him to the cops.
You three go this way.
Block the exits!
What the hell?
LEE Kwang-su.
JU Jae-young.
KIM Bu-seong.
- PARK Man-kyu.
- Drip on the floor, you die!
LEE Won-hyung.
You better not water it down!
- Fucking bitches won't answer me.
- We got you.
No small talk!
- No exchanging of urine!
- Yes, sir.
Do as you're told!
- No organs?
- That's right.
Cornea, liver, kidneys, skin tissue.
Took everything worth any money.
But harvesting isn't OH's style.
- Who's that?
- Came out of nowhere.
We're looking him up, but we can't link him to OH Myung-kyu.
It was crammed inside the furnace.
It's too little.
They already took it.
Yeah.
Name is CHA Tae-shik.
Lives in Yongsan, Seoul.
No drug offense and tested clean.
But from 1998 to 2006,
- there's no record for him.
- No record?
These pricks never register, so dig into his connections.
Just find his link to OH Myung-kyu.
This is a murder case.
21 Dongja district in Yongsan...
A pawnshop?
A vein burst in her nostrils.
You know what that means?
Her heart was beating when they got her eyes.
Ripped out of her head while she was alive!
The drugs aren't half your problems.
You keep playing quiet and you're fucked!
Understand?
Excuse me, Detective.
- Don't we get any snacks?
- Snacks?
You fucking want snacks?
Which one's CHA Tae-shik?
- Why?
- There's a lock on his record.
A lock?
Here's the stuff on OH Myung-kyu.
Tell Chi-gon I need to see him.
But he won't be back any time soon...
DARK KNIGHT
Escaped from Baron's castle.
Disappears into shadows at sunrise.
All right, let's just eat first.
Excuse me.
I'm left-handed.
Nothing beats hunger, eh?
He finally speaks!
We're making progress.
Let's eat and get this over with.
Holy shit!
- Hello?
- What the...
- Who is this?
- I'm just the Chinese major.
All I did was ask for some food.
Where's Detective PARK?
Put him on the phone!
Please don't kill me...
Young man!
Can you see that plate number?
What?
See if it's my son's van, would you?
What's the number?
It's 5124.
It's right, 5124!
Let go of me!
Let's go meet Mommy.
- Come up.
- What about my mom?
You don't come up, you won't see her.
Open the door!
Please!
Let me out!
Open the door!
6:41 P.M.
45 and 18 seconds.
Six cops hospitalized and OH's files stolen in 4 minutes 30 seconds.
Jung-ho's teeth are out.
KWON's knee is busted.
This is one complicated mother fucker.
The lock code on him is 011.
Guess who?
Military intelligence.
A lock on a civilian file, that's a first.
I'm tingling with curiosity.
There is one option.
What do you want to do?
Remember the short track incident with Ono?
A third-grade kid from Korea sent Bush an E-mail.
It read, "I'll kill you".
So the FBI asked us to look into it.
The dirty ones are always more suspicious.
- So you're saying...
- We'll send one as CHA Tae-shik.
They send us a request, and it's a one deal.
Even the NIS will have to release the information.
Obama...
To Obama?
You know Obama's E-mail, you idiot?
To the White House.
So, is that a go?
Or stop?
Go, no matter what.
Please don't kill me.
I'm telling you the truth!
That bitch started it all...
That's the only reason...
Koreans never get shit done in time.
Olympics come and they finally start building bridges.
But they're bound to collapse.
You were only trying to earn some weed money?
And no one is behind it?
Fucking prick.
Then who's that pawnshop bastard?
- He's with you, isn't he?
- What pawnshop?
Counting to three.
Then I'll torch your prick. One.
Please forgive me!
- Two.
- Don't kill me!
Please don't kill me!
- Three.
- Please don't!
You fucking startled me!
You're wasting your time.
The food is here.
Let's eat.
Can't you signal before you cut in?
I don't believe that pawnshop bastard.
Only an idiot would not call the cops.
Who cares?
This is our town.
- What about OH?
- I sent Ramrowan.
Alone?
This is Dolce and Gabbana!
Goddamn it.
I just bought it yesterday!
- Alone, again?
- Yes!
I told you not to send him alone.
That sick bastard likes going rogue anyway.
Let me go, just this once!
I'll double what they pay you!
Please let me go!
Once we refine the meth in here, we'll both be set for life!
Hey, I got it!
I got it.
The dead woman's daughter.
She ran errands for CHA and came here sometimes.
PARK Hyo-jung and CHA were lovers.
Kid runs the deliveries.
It's a perfect fit!
Game set!
So his lover was cut open and her eyes ripped out?
By CHA Tae-shik?
No?
Still no trace of the daughter?
Who's got time for her?
With OH Myung-kyu on the loose.
- Hello?
- I got it.
CHA Tae-shik.
Just get on with it!
Yes, sir.
This is the information we received from the U.S.
CHA Tae-shik.
A Special Forces agent in the Army Intelligence Command.
Completed classified missions from '98 to 2006.
A drill instructor for specialized forces.
Received a gold star and a military merit order.
Say hello to your guarantor, gentlemen.
He's got bad credit...
Mainly enemy raids, munitions, assassination and kidnap.
Specializes in secret foreign operations.
How much do you need?
You sold this here?
There's been some kind of mix-up.
We do loans, not telephones.
Tell me who bought it and you won't get hurt.
What are you, a cop?
The brutal training program is said to have made some congressman faint from shock.
That's all we know.
Fuck!
He bought dozens at a time. A harvester.
He deals hearts, livers, things like that.
After a car accident in 2006,
CHA Tae-shik's official records have stopped.
Gunshot wounds?
Unlike the other passenger, CHA was taken to a military hospital.
According to his surgeon, he was shot, not in a car accident.
Who the hell is this kid?
Who was the other passenger?
His wife.
She died at the scene.
We got a lead on CHA.
Where are you?
Yes.
This isn't online shopping.
We need to talk in person.
Yes.
The dream of a longer life, it's not about eating health food.
We'll go over the medical records.
All right.
Come on, baby!
You'll ruin the taste.
Ever hear this before?
Dupont!
Bottoms up.
Cheers.
You're serious?
If I find him, you'll rip up my loan contract?
- Just tell me where he is.
- Okay.
Yeah.
He stole their car.
We got him crossing the bridge.
And we tracked Dochi's phone there too.
Be careful.
- Welcome back, sir.
- Thanks.
First time here?
They've got great girls.
Hot and steamy.
But it's looking bleak tonight.
It's usually a sure thing here.
Hey.
I think tonight's a bust.
No fish in the sea.
Let's go somewhere else.
Where's Dochi?
Come out.
All right!
Fuck!
It's chronic constipation.
Come this way.
Dialysis.
Once it hits, you can hardly move.
Since it's for your wife, I'll give you a discount.
- What's your religion?
- Religion?
You need membership at a temple or cathedral.
Shows as voluntary donation and what not.
Takes two months.
Are you hot?
- You're sweating like a dog.
- I'm okay.
Hello?
Yes.
I'm in the bathroom.
Yes.
Okay.
Who's that?
- A friend.
- A friend who?
Who are you?
Get out!
Were we expecting another one?
Get the fuck out!
Mister!
Over here!
Fucking son of a bitch.
I won't ask twice.
Where is So-mi?
Fuck you, bitch!
So, you sold her...
- To the ants nest?
- I don't know!
Man-seok and Jong-seok know!
Where are they?
All right!
All right!
Out of the way!
You scared the shit out of me.
Pawnshop.
- Weren't you at the station?
- Why did you kill So-mi's mother?
Hey, don't blame us.
She actually saved three lives.
And you did the delivery, so you killed her.
Hello?
Hello?
- Hello?
- Is that what you did to So-mi?
What do you think?
Her insides are shit since they're not ripe, but I can sell her corneas.
It pays surprisingly well.
Five years in prison.
That's all I ask.
She might be waiting when you get out.
- You only live for tomorrow.
- What?
The ones that live for tomorrow get fucked by the ones living for today.
What are you babbling about?
I only live for today.
I'll show you just how fucked up that can be.
He hung up on me.
Report to the NIS, is that it?
We gave you information, but you lost the suspect and drugs.
This can't continue.
Report all files on OH and other connected suspects.
Your D.A. and I went to college together.
Let's keep things quiet.
You're fucking kidding me.
Are you after OH Myung-kyu or CHA Tae-shik?
It was us that staked out for two goddamn months.
And it's our boys lying in the hospital.
I'll catch them, write them up, throw them in.
I'll fuck anyone in my way, and give up my badge for it.
You just don't get it.
A National Defense employee tried to sell information overseas in 2006.
200 million dollar's worth of national security information.
Special forces were sent to assassinate and recover the goods.
MOON Dal-seo, infiltration unit agent.
And CHA Tae-shik, from extermination units.
Mission was successful, but not without sacrifices.
Isn't it beautiful?
I'm so proud of it...
So proud, it makes me cry.
Let me hug you.
Both of you.
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.
- Agent CHA!
- Tae-shik!
Look at me, Tae-shik!
Call an ambulance! Hurry!
Tae-shik!
Call an ambulance!
Stay still!
Look at me, you bastard!
Don't move!
You're losing blood!
Should I ask what happened?
Get me a gun.
Wow.
First words in three years, and that's it?
Not a Colt or a Tokarev.
Semi-automatic, at least 10 chambers.
Get some rest.
Your temperature is over 104.
One by one, I brought the abandoned mutts home.
Now I can't tell if this is a scrap yard or a dog pound.
An inch higher and that bullet would've killed you.
Don't do it.
I don't know what it is, but don't do it.
There's someone I need to find.
It's only been a few days, but I can't remember her face.
I should've taken a picture.
She took out 8000 dollars.
A second-grade kid!
Does that make sense?
Account belongs to NAM Sung-shik, PARK's pimp.
And it matches his statement.
Mister?
Sir, tell them I'm innocent!
CHA Tae-shik.
I'm KIM Chi-gon of the DEA.
Remember me?
I'll cut to the chase.
I'm going to catch you.
But let me ask you one thing.
You know PARK Hyo-jung's daughter, JUNG So-mi?
Are you looking for her?
So-mi is alive.
She took out money at an ATM near Gasan Station.
Tell me everything you know.
Or you'll never find her.
- Man-seok and Jong-seok.
- What?
They sent me to OH Myung-kyu, and they killed So-mi's mother.
That's everything I know.
The broker that worked for Man-Jong?
JANG Du-shik.
Find him and start searching Chinatown.
Chinatown?
Is it good?
Tell the brothers I'm leaving with the kid.
Say good-bye.
Bye.
You're leaving?
Be good and you'll go home like her.
Understand?
- Let's go.
- Mi-jin...
Bye.
Thanks!
If I'm good, I can see my mom again?
OUT OF ORDER
Hey!
JANG Du-shik!
What?
- Who are you?
- Who do you think, moron?
I'm Jesus.
I'm going to make you walk.
Help!
Over here!
- This man...
- Shut your trap!
He's hitting a crippled man!
It's empty.
- Atten-hut.
- Atten-hut!
- Run to the paddy wagon.
- Yes, sir!
- Left.
- Left!
- Left.
- Left!
Left!
I really don't know.
Half are in prison.
The rest are hiding, so they don't contact us.
This kid is missing.
Are they even selling kids these days?
Come on.
This isn't the eighties anymore, man.
Of course, they've done worse.
But this isn't it.
She's just an ant.
An ant?
Yeah, an ant.
OUT OF ORDER
It's the Chinese mafia system.
That's right, the Chinese mafia.
All those social outcasts, you know?
People in debt!
They take their kids and send them on deliveries.
Who suspects a kid, right?
They're just kids!
Cheap to maintain, safe from the cops.
It's the perfect solution!
And it's impossible to track.
Excuse me, sir.
Hey!
Code 402!
Freeze!
Put your hands up!
Stop right there!
Kids are so dramatic.
Hey, kid!
Just take her away.
Get back to work!
What is it?
I'm busy.
Hello?
So-mi.
Bring her to me.
Pawnshop?
How'd you get over there?
Man-seok!
- Who was that?
- This is your last chance.
Bring her to me within the hour.
I asked you who that was, mother fucker!
You have no idea who you're up against.
Touch one hair on my brother's body, and I'll rip her eyes and guts out!
You fucking bastard!
Tell Ramrowan to rip her eyes out.
What are you doing?
When the kids died, you took out their organs.
Sent the liver to one district, the eyes to another...
And the heart to Seoul.
Isn't that right?
I didn't do it.
Those young children,
wandering the country even after death...
Did that ever cross your mind?
What about you?
You ever wonder how much they're worth?
Even their parents don't want them anymore.
It's a win-win situation.
Am I right?
Wrong.
Just now,
you should've apologized to those kids.
Mother fucker.
If anything happens to me, you'll never see that bitch again.
You get me?
Even if I find So-mi, you two are still dead.
Hey.
Wait!
Fuck!
Goddamn it!
Yeah.
Hello?
Say something, you asshole!
Mother fucker!
Hold onto it.
Time to get back home.
Where's my mom?
Mom?
Mommy's right here.
I took her heart out.
So Mommy is right here.
Let's shake hands.
Why?
Don't you want to?
You said I could see my mom again.
He's lying, right?
She's not dead.
She's not dead, right?
She's alive.
Mister, you're lying, right?
My mom is alive!
Where is she?
Let me see her.
Please, mister!
Shit.
Coming through!
Identifications.
Inspect these people.
Granny.
We know everything.
Where are the kids?
Goddamn it.
Where the hell are they?
Detective NOH!
Yeah.
- What did you find?
- I got a name.
OH Sang-man, a surgeon.
Served 3 and a half for drug use.
Known as "500".
His goal is to cut open 500 bodies.
Track him down.
This is it?
Just one guy?
There you are.
Who the fuck are you?
Why did you come all the way here for her?
I'm her next-door neighbor.
Fucking idiot.
Her next-door neighbor?
You're fucking insane.
- Where's Jong-seok?
- So-mi first.
Hey.
Grab it.
Out of the way, moron!
I'll just stay over here.
Catch.
Strike!
She went to heaven to find her mommy.
But she can't find her without her eyes.
You messed with the wrong person.
Next-door neighbor?
You think this is some fucking joke?
Where's my brother?
Where the fuck is my brother?
- How many cavities do you have?
- What?
I run a pawnshop.
I take gold teeth.
I'll keep the gold teeth.
And I'll chew up everything else.
Fuck!
Where the fuck did he get a gun?
Is he a cop?
Move your fucking ass, moron!
Sorry, sir.
I got shot earlier...
You won't die, bitch.
- Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.
Get in the fucking car!
Fuck!
Son of a bitch.
Police?
Someone's getting killed!
Get over here!
Just trace the call and get over here!
Fuck, he's here!
Hurry up, assholes!
He's fucking here!
You moron!
It's bulletproof, mother fucker!
Shoot!
Shoot me, bitch!
Once the cops are here, you're finished.
I'm not going anywhere!
I said it's fucking bulletproof!
One more bullet left.
Mister...
Did you come to save me?
You came to save me, right?
Stay there.
You'll get blood on you.
Mister!
You came to save me!
Right?
Right, mister?
He got his eyes ripped out.
Put her in with him.
Could I ask you a favor?
Little girl.
You really got into trouble this time.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for pretending to not know you.
If I want to know you too much,
I can't help not wanting to.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know either.
I've never seen you smile before.
You're on your own now.
You can do it, right?
Just once...
Let me hug you once.
Let me hug you, just once.
Mister...
Are you crying?
The Man From Nowhere
Rip from DVD made by:
The war between sorcerers was fought in the shadows of history and the fate of mankind rested with the just and powerful Merlin.
He taught his secrets to three trusted apprentices,
Balthazar, Veronica, and Horvath.
He should have trusted only two.
Veronica and Balthazar witnessed the savagery of a sorcerer beyond evil,
Morgana le Fay, Merlin's most deadly enemy.
We are but servants.
- Merlin.
- Horvath!
You betray me?
I am no one's servant.
Well done. Now get the spell.
Morgana gained sorcery's most dangerous spell known as "The Rising,"
giving Morgana the power to raise an army of the dead and enslave mankind.
Veronica sacrificed herself for Balthazar by drawing Morgana's soul into her own body.
But Morgana began to kill her from the inside.
To save Veronica's life and to capture Morgana,
Balthazar trapped them both in the Grimhold, an inescapable prison.
Over time, Balthazar fought many sorcerers who tried to free Morgana, trapping them in layer upon layer of the doll.
Eventually, he captured Horvath as well.
As Merlin lay dying, he gave Balthazar his dragon ring, saying it would guide him to the child who would one day grow to be Merlin's successor, the Prime Merlinean.
The Prime Merlinean is the only one who can kill Morgana.
Balthazar would search for centuries.
And never, it is said, will Balthazar waver from his quest, for mankind will never be safe until Morgana is destroyed by the Prime Merlinean.
Hey, Tank. How did you even get up here?
David?
Field trip today.
Don't forget to wear clean underwear.
She means me, not you.
You're not supposed to be doing that, Dave.
Now!
David.
That's cool.
...which means that before Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty were built...
Pass it to Becky.
- Pass it on.
- Pass it on.
- Pass it to Becky. - Here.
Let's go.
Get on the ferry.
Get your bags.
Stay close.
Here we go.
Hey, stop!
Excuse me, excuse me.
No!
No, lady, don't!
No way.
The second emperor of the Han dynasty locked his least-favorite wife in this urn for 10 years to the day.
They say you open it up, the same thing will happen to you.
I'm sorry. I'm looking for this note.
Have you seen it?
It kind of just blew into your store.
A note?
It blew into your store.
It was just a...
Coincidence.
Yeah, it was just a coincidence.
I have something I'd like to show you, Dave.
- How'd you know my name was Dave?
- 'Cause I can read minds!
It's on your backpack.
Come over here.
This is very special and if it likes you, you can keep it.
I better not.
My teacher said I couldn't be gone for long.
She knows I'm here.
You're a bad liar, Dave.
That's good. Oh, boy. No way.
I have been searching a very long time.
Magically, here you are.
That ring on your finger means something, Dave.
It means you're going to be a very important sorcerer one day.
And your first lesson begins right now with your very own Encantus.
Do not move, do not touch anything.
No way.
When am I?
New York City.
Not where. The year.
You are wasting my time.
What happened to "don't touch anything"?
That's not very sporting of you, Balthazar.
Be quiet.
It's not you.
He's been like this for 1,000 years.
I'll explain later.
I need the Grimhold. Where's that doll?
I'll have that doll.
I want that doll.
Leave, Dave!
Leave now!
David Stutler!
Don't ever leave your...
There's these crazy wizard guys in there!
They're made of roaches!
No!
Don't go in there!
The store's on fire! Don't go in!
Those guys are
crazy.
You really shouldn't tell stories.
Let's go.
He peed his pants!
A jar broke.
It's just water!
There was a fire!
- Yeah, Stutler had a leak.
- He's such a geek.
Good morning.
What is that? Oh, right.
Good morning, beautiful.
Hey, heads up.
Happy birthday.
Thank you, Bennet.
You're up early.
Professor Heiderman wants me to give a presentation to his Physics 101 class.
What?
Teaching long division to English majors?
I know. It's like the Peace Corps, but it's Heiderman's class.
Hey, Bio nerds are getting drunk tonight.
And we invited cheerleaders from Princeton.
So there's smart cheerleaders.
So, seriously, you're saying you don't want to go out on your birthday?
I got to finish my Tesla coil project if I want to graduate.
Dave, are you familiar with the gray wolf?
Oh, no, please, Bennet.
Not this again with the gray wolf.
I can't...
The gray wolf is a pack animal.
He must find a mate.
He must hunt and grunt.
He must participate.
You're going to get booted out of the pack!
Alone. Eaten by a hungry bear.
That's a real pick-me-up pep talk, and I'm ready to go get the day.
No, no.
Oh, man.
Everything okay down there?
I should just leave, right?
Right.
Wait. I'm sorry. Becky?
Becky Barnes.
Dave!
We were in fourth grade together.
I do know you.
Dave Stutler.
- Right?
- That's me.
Yeah. You're that kid.
What was that place called?
- Arcana...
- Arcana Cabana?
Yeah.
- So, did you transfer?
- Yeah, I did.
And got some help. Treatment.
Yes, that was weird.
You know what?
It turns out it's just a glucose imbalance.
Hallucinations?
- Not uncommon in young subjects.
- Ah...
Right.
It's a great anecdote.
Hey, Becky.
Becky?
Hey, Becky?
So how are you enjoying Physics 101?
My brain just does not think physics.
So, what does it think, then?
Music, mostly.
So, this is me.
You work at the radio station?
Yeah, I do an afternoon show.
Are you kidding me?
That's so cool!
It's just college radio.
Like, seven people listen to it.
I'll be listening.
That's one more.
You can round it up to eight.
I think that's our antenna!
- What's going on?
- Hey, gorgeous.
The whole mixer is toast, and Freddy called in sick.
Sorry to bother you.
Where does your engineer keep his equipment?
Who's this guy?
So, the good news is you're still transmitting.
The bad news is your return loss, way too high.
All right, if I know what I'm doing, we should be good!
Yes!
- Thank you.
- No, please, it was my pleasure.
I could tell this is all pretty important for you.
My show is the one thing that...
Well, you know.
Physics. That's my thing.
I'll see you around.
You didn't ask her out!
You just fixed her antenna and you left.
That's not the point.
She will remember me.
"She will remember me"?
Who are you? Braveheart?
Bennet, I blew my shot at getting this girl 10 years ago.
I can't do it again.
Now get out of here before you get electrocuted.
... and it's a miracle we made it on the air tonight.
This show may not matter, but the music does.
This is Becky Barnes, WNYU Radio, hoping there's music all around you.
I don't understand. Why did you have to buy this piece of junk?
Junk?
It's an antique!
Antique?
It's a piece of junk from a flea market!
Am I the first one out?
That's a yes.
Our 10 years are up, Balthazar.
When I get the Grimhold from young David,
I'll tell him you said hello.
Cheerio, Balthazar!
I thought B minus was generous.
I've recently been released from a 10-year sentence, during which the only reading material available to me was your so-called report on Napoleon Bonaparte from your school bag.
Your analysis was obvious, your prose was weak.
- I was nine.
- Irrelevant.
Where's the Grimhold?
That doll you took from the shop.
The doll held something very powerful.
Something very important to me.
You had it last.
I want it back.
Listen, I'm...
- I threw it in the street.
- Where's the Grimhold?
It's been a long time. I don't actually know where it is.
I'll cut the truth out of you.
Sweet.
Get him.
Wolves?
No, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Wolves.
No, no, no.
Oh, no!
Kill him.
No!
Puppies?
Oh, my.
No way.
Where's the doll, Dave?
Him, him.
All right, get up here.
Now! Now! Hurry!
Oh, no!
This is not happening.
This is not happening.
I taste sour in my mouth.
Take it easy, Dave.
Deep breaths.
What?
Now that is not happening!
What's wrong? What is it?
No, no, no, no!
You are not doing this to me again!
Do you have any idea what my life has been like for the last 10 years?
I've been stuck in an urn for the last 10 years.
So have I!
A figurative urn of ridicule.
Do you know that in certain parts of the tri-state area, they still refer to having a nervous breakdown as "pulling a David Stutler"?
Did you know that?
Try to be a good listener, Dave.
That doll is called the Grimhold.
It is a prison for the most dangerous Morganians in history, each one locked up in a layer of the doll.
Horvath wants to free his fellow Morganians and destroy the world.
This must not happen.
Yeah. For sure.
The truth is, you have a very special gift.
You need to see that.
I just want to be normal.
Normal life. I want to forget about that day at Arcana Cabana.
I want to forget about magic.
I want to forget everything.
- You should duck.
- What?
You want to forget magic?
Then why did you keep the ring?
I was going to sell that on eBay.
You're still a bad liar, Dave.
I like that about you. It's a good sign.
You have the gift.
No, I have a life.
You're the last person Horvath saw with the Grimhold.
That puts you on his list.
So unless you want him to turn you into a pig who just loves physics, then you better help me find that doll before he does.
This is crazy.
You see how crazy this is, right?
All right.
All right.
You help me get it back, you're done.
- Really?
- You can walk away.
Can you please put my dresser back?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you... Oh, no.
Please don't do that. What are you doing?
What?
- Whoa. What is that?
- It's my Grimhold tracking device.
Biometric pressure spell displaces the atmosphere above the doll.
Looks like downtown.
If we can track the Grimhold, so can Horvath.
- So why don't we just take the eagle?
- Too high-profile for a trip downtown.
- I'll have to call you a tow.
- Won't be necessary.
Yeah, but this car's been impounded for 10 years.
This is low-profile.
She missed me.
I'm going to give you the basics.
Strictly Sorcery 101. Put on the ring.
Nothing's going to happen.
Yeah?
Kidding.
You've heard how people use only 10% of their brains?
Sorcerers can manipulate matter because they're born with the capability to use the entire power of their brains.
Which also explains why molecular physics comes so easily to you.
So, wait. Is sorcery science or magic?
Yes and yes.
For now, all you need is a basic combat spell.
Making fire.
What causes molecules to heat up?
They vibrate.
Everything we see is in a constant state of vibration, thus the illusion of solidity.
But how do we take that which appears solid and have it burst into flames?
We will the vibrations to go faster.
Step one, clear your mind.
Step two, see the molecules.
Step three, make them shake.
- Got it? - No!
I definitely don't "got it."
Trust the ring, Dave. And keep it subtle.
Civilians mustn't know magic exists.
That would be complicated.
Says the guy in the 350-year-old rawhide trench coat.
I threw it in the street.
It's been a long time. I don't actually know where it is.
I threw it in the street.
Don't go in there!
He peed his pants!
The store's on fire!
Don't go in!
Those guys are...
It's just water!
There was a fire!
I threw it in the street.
But where?
Get out of the way, freak!
I need to pull in there!
Are you addressing me?
Hey, don't mess with me.
Where was I?
Chinatown.
This is it.
I'll get the Grimhold.
Keep an eye out for Horvath.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Do you have an appointment?
I'm sorry to trouble you.
I'm looking for a...
Well, it's rather strange.
It's a nesting doll. It's about this big.
Angry-looking Chinese gentleman on the front.
- Nesting doll?
- Yes.
It's possible. I collect so many objects.
You speak Mandarin.
That was Cantonese, Horvath.
The Grimhold. Where is it?
An old associate of mine speaks impeccable Cantonese.
He lived about 200 years ago.
Know him? Sun Lok.
Of course you do.
You locked him inside the Grimhold.
Whoops.
Opened it.
Are you all right? Looks like... What the...
I'm like one of them.
Dave?
You should run.
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.
Be still.
Balthazar!
Oh, God. Come on.
You skipped the first step!
- Clear your mind!
- Skipped the first step.
Clear my mind?
Are you insane?
Little bit.
Oh, man.
This is it.
Clear your mind. Believe.
Yeah!
Go Team Magical Stuff!
Did you see that?
Did you see what I just did?
I did it.
It can't be.
Unbelievable.
Hey, what do you got?
Did you see what happened here?
You know what? Bottle rocket meets paper dragon in this Asian festival.
Lit it up like a birthday cake.
We got swamped with calls saying there was a real dragon.
Between you and me, Cap, I think some of these folks were hitting the sake pretty hard.
Sake's Japanese, actually.
Carry on.
- "Sake's Japanese"?
- Well, it is.
- I was in character.
- Oh, right.
You may now return the ring to me.
I'm a man of my word.
You helped me, we're done.
Right. Right.
I'd like to learn some more.
We'll need a place to work.
Somewhere under Horvath's radar.
I think I can help with that.
This was originally a subway turnaround.
They let me work down here because some of my experiments skew a bit dangerous.
Oh, my professor has a hookup, so nobody knows we're down here.
I didn't have a chance to give you this before.
Your Encantus.
I remember it being bigger.
Pocket edition.
The Encantus is our textbook.
The art and science and history of sorcery.
Including our recent history as well.
Come on.
See?
There you are.
Before we can put Horvath back inside the Grimhold, we must first turn you into a sorcerer, which begins now.
Step back.
- I really was doing stuff.
- Eyes open.
Mouth closed.
This is the Merlin Circle.
It focuses your energy.
Helps you master new spells.
It is where you will learn the Art.
Step inside, you leave everything else behind.
Once you enter, there is no going back.
So, I should probably pee first?
Better safe than...
I can hold it.
I am Balthazar Blake, sorcerer of the 777th degree,
and you are my apprentice.
Sweet.
Your ring is not a piece of jewelry.
It projects the electrical energy of your nervous system into the physical world.
Without his ring, a sorcerer is powerless.
The only other thing a sorcerer needs is a nice pair of pointy shoes.
Your rubber soles block the current.
Plus it helps to look classy.
These are old man shoes.
Excuse me?
I love them.
A lot.
I haven't seen that cane since I saw a picture of it when I was a boy.
You've been locked up a long time.
And now I'm out.
And I need soldiers.
I got one kid.
He ain't old school.
One will do.
Your ingenuity and your heart will give you an advantage over Morganians.
They rely only on the power of their magic.
But if you're up against the wall, there's only one weapon of choice, the plasma bolt.
Nothing. There's nothing.
I got it!
I got one!
I got one!
That's underwhelming.
Again.
... and invite my soul...
And again.
See?
That's what padding is for.
So, out of a bath full of jewels, I'm going to emerge, right?
And everyone's going to think I'm me.
I reach into the big top hat and I pull myself out, but I'm a woman.
A ball of fire, right, a baby sitting in a nappy, but I would like a tiger.
If I could get, like, a tiger jumping out of a leopard.
Gorgeous.
Just perfect, darling.
Yeah.
Yeah, now, keep it straight up sinister.
Oh, do tell me this is a joke.
Sorry, are you lost?
So, you're what passes for a Morganian these days.
Maxim Horvath!
You are one smoking man of...
Will you excuse us, ladies?
Yes, excuse us, ladies.
Bob.
Sorry.
So, they tell me you're some kind of entertainer.
Five sold-out shows at the Garden, plus back end on the pay-per-view.
Did you ever see Morgana pull a rabbit out of a hat?
Look, my master disappeared when I was 15, vanished!
Left me with nothing but an Encantus and some prescription-grade abandonment issues.
So I improvised.
Well, the time for improvisation is over.
Balthazar Blake may have found the Prime Merlinean.
He wears the ring?
The best way to defend against fire, vacuum sphere.
Your turn.
I did it!
I did it!
Excellent. Excellent.
- Excellent.
- I just did that.
What's wrong with your Tesla coil?
It seems to be firing on its own.
Really, really funny.
This will be hilarious, then.
Oh, my God!
Dude!
Beg your pardon. I haven't eaten in 10 years.
Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.
You mind if I ask what's so special about this bench?
- No, no, no.
- What?
There's no time for that, and too much at stake.
That girl, she's the one, man.
And you're my mentor, Balthazar.
Aren't you supposed to help me to achieve my personal goals?
Yes!
Yes!
Except I'm not your mentor.
I'm your master.
And your master says if Horvath catches you out on the street, you'll die.
Is she worth that?
Think about it, Dave.
And don't eat my sandwich.
Becky!
What a coincidence.
Hey, Dave.
- Going uptown or...
- Are you stalking me?
Not in a threatening way.
Why was I even concerned?
So I listened to your show last night.
- What did you think?
- It was amazing.
I've never actually heard of any of those bands, which I think is a good indicator that they're cool.
I'm glad someone was listening.
This may come as a surprise to you, I don't get up to much.
Give me the cash. Give it. Come on.
- Give me the bracelet.
- Okay, okay.
- Give me.
- Hey, hey, hey.
That was my grandmother's bracelet.
No!
Dave, don't!
You just give me that bracelet back, please.
You better run back to your girlfriend.
Believe me, I wish she was...
You thought she was my girlfriend?
Really?
Is that the kind of vibe you got?
You talk too much. Shut up.
What are you doing?
I have no idea what you're referring to.
I honestly...
- You seeing this?
- Heads up.
Up the stairs!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Here you go.
Your grandmother's bracelet.
How did you do that?
That guy was huge.
I've been doing a lot of cardio boxing lately.
Let me introduce Thunder, Lightning.
Something about you seems different.
I'm wearing new shoes.
- Nice.
- Thank you. This your train?
Yes. Thank you.
I just want to tell you that if you want me to help you with your midterms, come by my lab.
- I'll text you the address.
- Yes, yes, that would be great.
- Yeah?
- Tomorrow?
It's a date.
No, no, no. It's not a date!
It's a date like an appointment.
No. A date like an appointment!
Love is a distraction.
Sorcery requires complete focus.
Let's go, Thunder and Lightning.
There's more to learn.
This is perfect.
The Rising will happen here.
We'll use their satellite dishes on the rooftops.
There, and there, and there.
- Get it done.
- My "Best of" DVD drops next month.
Here we go. All right. Move.
Sorry about that.
It's just nice for them to see a genuine icon like me.
Fortunately, they'll all be dead soon.
And before that, we need to find the boy.
Well, how do we do that?
We'll wait until he's alone.
Now, focus on control. Set me down slow and steady.
Dave?
It's Becky.
I'll be back shortly.
Could you please hide? Hide now.
Please.
Dave, get back here.
We have important work to do.
- Knock, knock.
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
We should go.
A library, anyplace...
Dave?
Is that company I hear?
Yeah. Okay.
Fine. Becky, this is my...
Uncle.
Uncle Balthazar.
Hey, Dave, I'm confused.
I thought you and I were staying in together.
If this is a bad time,
- I can come back.
- Yes, actually.
No. No.
Uncle, you and I have plans for later on.
Becky, let's just get out of here.
You know what?
It's all right, because I just remembered
I have to go into town to pick up your anti-itch cream.
So, you two stay here.
Pleasure to meet you.
Okay, enough with the studying. There's something I want to show you.
- What are these things?
- Tesla coils.
I was using them to generate something called plasma.
The thing is, I got so fixated on the technical aspects of it that I almost didn't notice something kind of beautiful.
I think you'd better step into my cage.
Okay, it's definitely the first time anyone has said that to me.
I'm not surprised.
Just hold on to this bar, please.
Both hands.
Yep.
Okay.
Okay, hold on tight and enjoy the show.
Oh, my gosh.
How is this possible?
The coils are firing at such a high frequency that the sparks literally create soundwaves as they fly through the air.
Which is nerdy.
You were listening.
I played this song the other night.
These coils are my life.
Two years I'm down here working with them, and they're making their own music and it was lost on me.
I was never able to appreciate it until I met you
and heard you talking about music on your radio show, and...
I'm sappy.
This is me.
So, do you want to meet up later?
8:00? My lab?
Yeah. Yeah, that would be great.
With me?
With you? Yes.
Making sure.
- I got to...
Yoga.
- Yeah, I've got to go to the bathroom.
I got a date with a girl 'cause I'm awesome
So, you're the one.
Excuse me?
Prime Merlinean, eh?
You don't look like much.
I don't actually know what you're talking about.
Cool. Makes this easy.
Can't have anyone hearing your girly cries, right?
I don't actually know who you are.
Really, you don't recognize me?
Are you in Depeche Mode?
What...
What...
- What do you weigh, like a buck 20?
- Whoa! What the...
This is high school all over again.
All right, I tell you what.
Hit me with your best shot, your most powerful spell.
- Okay.
- Get the ring out. Put it on. Good boy.
Okay.
- No, I'm joking.
- Nothing is happening.
- Have you cleared your mind?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
- That's nerves and it's the pressure.
- I got nothing happening.
- I'm new at this. - The ring's on.
Take the ring off.
- Take off the ring.
- Take it off.
- Yeah, it doesn't help me...
- Enough, you idiot.
Watch the door.
You.
No!
- Hello, Dave.
- Hi.
- So, Dave. - Oh, man.
I'm going to kill you.
Oh, yes, right here in this dismal bathroom.
It's not very classy, but there you go.
But before we get to that unpleasantness, you're going to tell me where the Grimhold is.
Where is she?
She?
He hasn't told you, has he?
The truth about who's inside the doll?
Sweetheart, you've put your faith in the wrong man.
Tell me, have you ever been in love?
- I... - Yeah.
You're in love right now.
I can see it in your eyes.
No, no, no, no. Don't deny it.
I wonder what would happen if you lost her.
Shut up.
You'd be no better than the rest of us.
Where is the Grimhold?
I don't know.
Oh, Dave, you really are the most dreadful liar.
That's what I keep telling him.
Want your guy back?
It's been a while since I've seen the Hungarian Mirror Trap.
I guess I'm just old-fashioned.
Balthazar, look out!
What are you doing here, Dave?
Horvath was trying to kill me.
His moral compass doesn't exactly point north.
Yeah, well, what about yours?
Huh?
You haven't been completely truthful with me.
That guy called me the Prime Merlinean.
Balthazar, what is that?
Now, I'm not doing anything else until you start being truthful with me about what's going on.
Who is in that Grimhold?
Morgana.
Wake up that moron in stall number three for me, would you?
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Morgana.
She was making preparations for The Rising, something that would enable her to enslave mankind by resurrecting dead Morganian sorcerers.
So, after the witch girl, there's another doll that contains the greatest evil the world has ever known?
She's in the last doll.
And what does it have to do with this
Prime Merlinean?
Merlin had three apprentices.
I was one of them.
You were Merlin's apprentice?
He cast a spell to keep us from aging until we found the sorcerer who would inherit his power.
And his dragon ring.
Some part of you, no matter how small, must share the same blood.
As Merlin?
Great men have always been called.
This is your calling.
Merlin said,
"The only one who will ever be able to destroy Morgana once and for all
"is the Prime Merlinean."
So I'm supposed to save the world.
I...
I just don't think I'm up for that.
Do you think I've been teaching you magic tricks for some little girl's tea party?
When you stepped inside this circle, I told you there was no going back.
You took an oath!
I have been searching 1,000 years for you.
Fighting Morganians, protecting the Grimhold.
You're going to set me free.
You have to become the Prime Merlinean.
And I'm not asking.
I have a student who's failing my class. I need his file.
First I'll need to see your faculty identification card.
You don't need to see my faculty identification card.
I don't need your faculty identification card.
"These are not the droids you're looking for."
Here it is. He has an unauthorized lab space.
Okay, so, how will I know when I'm it?
The Prime Merlinean?
The Prime Merlinean will become so powerful within he no longer needs his ring to cast magic.
When you can do that, you're ready to take on Morgana.
Tank!
What is he doing here anyway?
This should be good.
Schematic for a fusion spell.
The merging of two souls into one physical body.
I've only ever seen one sorcerer successfully pull off human fusion.
And Tank is here for...
Practice.
Are you telling me you're trying to possess Tank?
Yeah. I'm not so sure it's the best idea, either.
No.
Oh, man.
Becky's coming now, and I'm standing in a puddle of pop.
I need to stop and clean.
We're not done training.
Balthazar, I've been waiting for 10 years to see this girl again.
Do you have any idea what that's like?
When I come back, you better be focused.
This is really sticky.
I'm doomed.
This.
Thank you. Thank you.
I command you to stop!
Oh, no. Man.
Becky.
- Hi.
- Hi. You're on time.
- You forgot?
- No, no, no. I didn't forget.
- Is everything okay?
- What, me?
How are you doing?
I'm good. I'm good.
Would you please stop that?
Will you...
It's probably best for you to leave.
What am I saying?
Okay. Okay, I will go.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm having issues.
My coils!
Disperse!
You have abused the sacred art, and you have abused the Merlin Circle.
Magic isn't a game.
No shortcuts!
Falling in that water and getting electrocuted, that's how a sorcerer loses his power!
What rule is that? Fourteen?
Twenty-seven?
I can't even remember!
What difference does it make if it's obvious that I can't even control a few mops?
The stronger the man, the stronger the sorcerer.
Thank you.
Thank you for another useless motto!
I have another one for you.
You will not control your magic if you will not control yourself.
You need to stop your worrying and start believing in yourself.
Is that what you do?
- What I do isn't the point.
- I think it is.
I'm convinced you exist purely to make my life a living hell.
You don't know anything about a living hell.
- You're making progress.
- No, I'm not making progress.
No ring, right?
No magic.
I can't move the chairs.
I can't do it.
It's not me, Balthazar.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
I'm not it.
I'm not a hero.
I'm not the Prime Merlinean.
I'm just a physics nerd who looks really, really stupid in these shoes.
Dave.
What are you doing here?
I saw you outside the coffee shop, so I followed you.
You looked a little more distressed than usual.
That bad, huh?
Did you really think that one botched date was going to make me hate you forever?
Yeah.
I do have to ask you this one thing.
What are you doing up here?
Yeah.
A friend of mine brought me here once.
And the height doesn't bother you?
- Are you afraid of heights?
- A little bit, yeah.
Trust me. Here, come on.
Come on. You're good.
Yeah.
Do you remember when you drew King Kong on the bus window?
And he lined up with the Empire State Building?
You remember that?
It was cool.
You saw the world in your own way.
I was just trying to impress you.
Well, it worked.
Not bad for a 10-year-old kid.
Yeah, right. What happened?
- What?
What do you mean?
- The bitter irony of the fact that 10-year-old me is far cooler than 20-year-old me.
I think 20-year-old Dave is...
He's all right.
Like, "all right" all right, or "all right!" all right?
I think he is somewhere in the middle.
That's a diplomatic answer.
And thank you.
- Hey.
- Hello.
I'm sorry.
I think you and I need to have a talk.
No apology necessary. Let us move on.
You're a diamond, mate.
Surprisingly well done.
Now go find the Grimhold.
You seem to have rather a soft spot for that boy.
Has Balthazar made a new friend?
I don't see the Grimhold.
That's because you're using your eyes.
Clever Balthazar.
Always up to his little tricks.
Found it.
It's lighter than I remember.
We once fought together, Maxim.
A lot's happened since those days.
- This isn't about that.
- Oh, yes, it is, Balthazar.
It's always been about that.
Veronica chose you instead of me, the great Balthazar Blake, my best friend.
Well, I'm going to let you watch me release Morgana.
Let you watch your world crumble into nothing!
Drake. Let's go.
- Nice catch.
- I owed you one.
- They got the doll.
- Let's get it back.
Hang on.
Hang on, Tank.
Go left.
Whoa!
What the...
Horvath!
He's in here somewhere.
Wait. He has the power to turn his car into a taxi?
Use your ring and lock in on the Grimhold.
- Remember, it moves with the ring. - Okay, yeah.
Right, right, right.
Go!
Go!
Here they come!
Whoa!
What the heck!
Nice one!
- Hey! Well, look at that.
- Hang on.
Oh, my God.
Take the tunnel.
What is that, smoke?
Time for a little revenge.
- What the heck is this?
- Yes, we drove through a mirror.
- We're trapped in a reverse world.
- So...
It is, it is. Horvath's payback for the bathroom mirror.
No, no. We won't die as long as
- we get out of here soon.
- Okay.
- By driving through our own reflection.
- Fantastic.
- There. In the window.
- This is it.
No, no, no, no, no. You're not...
- Here we go.
- We're not going to make that!
Hello, Balthazar.
No, no, no. Back up. Back up.
Back up.
I've got an idea. I've got an idea.
- Dave, don't.
- Please just let me do it.
- What?
- '73 Pinto?
This is your idea?
No! No. My idea was to turn their car into a beater.
- Finish it.
- Right!
I think he stopped.
Hold on, Tank.
Hold on, Tank. I got you, buddy.
Hey!
I'm sorry.
I thought you were someone else.
Where's Horvath?
Did he get away?
Where's the Grimhold?
Who was that?
That was her, wasn't it?
The third apprentice.
For centuries, Veronica, Horvath and I were the only thing standing between Morgana and man's destruction.
Our friendship and our magic were what Veronica and I depended on.
You fell for her, didn't you?
I fell for her.
Like you, all Veronica wanted was to be normal.
Normal things, normal life.
I fell.
And so did Horvath.
That's why Horvath betrayed us.
For 1,000 years, you've been carrying her around with you.
In the Grimhold.
I was going to give this to her that night.
I'm sorry.
Okay, Balthazar.
We are going to get Veronica out and destroy Morgana.
What's happened to you?
Nothing.
You're still a bad liar.
- Why does everyone...
- You know, I am glad she likes you.
No, I am not surprised. Only glad.
There's nothing like it, is there?
Put your old man shoes back on.
We have some work to do.
Are all the satellite dishes in position?
All lined up.
I chipped my mani, which is not cool.
No, I imagine it's not.
Inside there lies our next coworker.
Abigail Williams, a little witch who put Salem on the map.
Once she's out, we're at the Morgana shell.
Now that's going to take a lot of time and energy to crack.
So what are we going to do?
Have you heard of the Parasite Spell?
Sorry, I forgot your education's somewhat lacking.
Yeah, I prefer to go more by instinct.
You know, what feels right.
Very good.
Well, the Parasite Spell is a rather nasty piece of business.
It originated in Haiti, if memory serves.
It enables one sorcerer to steal the energy from another.
Well, you weren't really using it, were you?
Excuse me?
I'd like to make a request.
I just finished my show. But maybe next time, okay?
I said I'd like to make a request.
All right.
When Morgana is released, no matter what happens, promise me you'll do whatever it takes to destroy her.
I promise.
And for the record, you wear the old guy shoes very well.
My feet disagree with you, but thank you.
Knuckle bump.
Might as well.
Now that I have kidnapped the girl for you, is it time to release Morgana?
I'll give her your regards.
Mr. Horvath, have I done something wrong?
Not at all.
I need your power to free Morgana. I just don't need you.
Well, that's two.
One more to go.
That's horrifying.
Let's just find the Grimhold and be done with it.
Battery Park. The Rising.
Persian Quickrug.
And he thinks I'm old-fashioned.
Ostentatious.
Nothing, nothing.
So that's Morgana.
Veronica.
Balthazar?
That was easy.
Come on, Dave.
You know the drill.
Give me what I want, and I'll let her go.
Dave, what is going on?
It's gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.
No, she's not!
She's going to be ground up into chunks and fed to the cat unless you give me Merlin's ring and the Grimhold.
Balthazar?
He's busy admiring the decor.
So what's it going to be?
Take it.
- You're okay?
- Merlin's ring.
It's been a while since I've been this close to it.
I wonder if it still works.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so.
The Grimhold?
I see.
He took my ring.
He was gonna kill Becky.
I'm so sorry, Balthazar.
I would have done the same thing, Dave.
Where are you going?
Battery Park.
Horvath's going to release Morgana.
Well, you can't take him on and Morgana at the same time.
That's...
- You literally can't.
- I have to try.
Well, then I'm going with you.
Without any magic?
He has your ring.
I'm going alone.
No, that's a normal thing for him.
No one knows how much time they have to be with the people that are the most important.
Enjoy it.
That guy just flew away on an eagle!
- I...
- A steel eagle.
Becky, I wanted to talk to you about this.
I just haven't known where to start.
I'm just happy you're okay.
Look, Dave.
If you can just tell me the truth, then I promise I will do my best to understand.
Okay.
The first thing you should know about me is that I'm a sorcerer.
Okay.
I can conjure and shoot plasma bolts out of my hand.
I can speed time up, slow it down, varying degrees of levitation.
And I thought my last boyfriend was different 'cause he wore a scarf.
- Baby, I'll just come back.
Okay? - Okay.
- I'll see you in a minute.
- Okay. All right. I'm here.
Bad time, Dave.
Bennet. Thank God you answered.
I got a real emergency on my hands.
I need you to meet me at my lab right now!
- Becky, I got to let you out.
- What?
Let me out?
Okay.
I think I know how to defeat them without any magic.
How?
The rings on Horvath's cane.
He put them there to gain more power, but they make him a better conductor.
Dave, I have no idea what you're talking about.
All right, Rebecca, here it is.
Many evil sorcerers will be raised from the dead tonight.
So, basically, Morgana is trying to destroy the world as we know it.
Oh, just that.
This is really dangerous.
I can't bring you into it.
Well, I think I'm already into it.
And besides, if you blow it, we're all gonna die anyway, right?
I want to come with you.
You're sexy.
- I got all the Tesla coil remotes. - Thanks, brother.
I appreciate it.
Oh!
I found this after we hung up.
It was on the desk.
"Give this to Veronica.
Balthazar."
I don't think Balthazar's planning on coming back.
I don't know what you're into here, Dave, but whatever it is, you are definitely participating!
Thank you, Bennet.
I appreciate that. We should go.
Now is The Rising.
Now is the time.
Veronica.
It's me, Horvath.
Morgana.
No need to look so pathetic.
Destroy that thing.
I never want to see it again.
I cannot raise the dead until the circle is complete.
- No way. Man alive!
- What?
Are you telling me you honestly don't see that?
No. See what?
I think they're using the satellite dishes on the tops of the buildings to direct and amplify the electromagnetic energy.
All right, we're pulling over. We're pulling over.
Becky, I need you to do me a favor.
I need you to go up to the very top of that thing.
Great.
You got to move that antenna and just disrupt the signal.
Okay. Right.
Hey, Becky.
Do you remember that letter I wrote when we were 10 years old?
Friend or girlfriend?
I never saw what you checked, so in case I die tonight, could you please tell me?
Don't die and I'll tell you.
Oh, yeah, okay.
Balthazar.
- Enough of your old tricks, Balthazar.
- As you wish.
Time was, things were pretty even between us, Balthazar.
As you can see,
I've acquired some new jewelry.
I'm coming, buddy.
I'm coming. I'm coming.
All right, what...
What is this? What am I looking at?
No!
And a walker. Of course she has a...
A matador gored by a bull can take up to three days to die.
Sounds unpleasant, doesn't it?
The circle is nearly complete.
It must be awful, Balthazar.
All these years, fighting to stop this one moment and then coming up short.
That's my car.
Thank you!
We're too late.
Veronica.
Is she...
They're both still with us.
Balthazar, what have you done?
What you did for me.
- Remember your promise.
- Balthazar, no.
You'll do whatever it takes to destroy Morgana.
No. No, I can't. I won't lock you in this thing.
Neither will I.
How sweet.
- And now we end this.
- No!
No way.
No ring.
It is you.
The Prime Merlinean!
Fools!
Veronica!
Now it's my turn.
Is that the best that you can do?
I sure hope not.
And now it's my turn.
Come on.
Climb.
You have Merlin's powers, but you don't have his strength or his skill.
You are still weak.
But I'm not alone.
I brought a little science with me. Now!
I did it!
Balthazar, I actually did it!
He's gone.
He completed his quest.
No, no, no, no.
It's not over. He can't die.
I just... Not now.
Come on.
That's not good enough.
Veronica, would you please step back?
If Morgana can stop his heart, maybe I can start it.
All right, here we go, bud. Here we go. Listen.
You...
You with all your stupid rules!
And all those old man shoes.
And your constantly saving me with that look in your eyes.
Come on!
Come on.
I had a dream.
You were insulting me, Dave. Repeatedly.
Me?
That's pretty weird, huh?
No, kind of makes sense.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Welcome back, old man.
Dave!
- You did it!
- I know. And I'm still alive.
And, surprisingly, so am I.
I know.
Oh, the note. Right.
- Friend or girlfriend?
- I don't care.
Girlfriend. Definitely girlfriend.
Would you like to have breakfast with me?
In France?
France?
Yeah, I got us a ride.
Okay, you're fun.
Becky, there's something I forgot to mention to you.
I really have no idea how to land this thing.
Rip from DVD made by:
Hey, how did you open your cell door?
Hey!
What are you doing?
Open Sector 2!
How did you get out?
Get back in your cell.
I told you, get back in your cell!
Let's give you a few friends to play with.
Sorry.
Send some guards in.
I'm trying.
Okay, I'm set. How's things going down below?
How do you think?
I'm in a sewer.
The doors won't open!
We're locked in!
Sound the alarm!
We've lost control!
Captain!
I'm in position.
Move to phase 2.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
What's happening, Benji?
Oh, God.
He's not going to the extraction point.
Stay focused.
He knows where he's going.
No, I'm not.
I won't.
I will not open that door.
Please go to the extraction point, Ethan.
I know.
I know what this means, but I can't.
I'm not authorized.. .
Go to the extraction point, Ethan.
Go to the extraction point!
Oh, you're just going to wait.
We're going to wait.
Great. I can wait.
Okay, fine. Fine!
Fine!
There.
Jane?
We're going to have a slight delay.
Why do you want to go in there?
Bogdan!
Sergei?
Time to go!
Now?
Yes, now!
I don't know what he's doing, and for some reason, I'm helping him.
As long as he's where he should be when the song ends.
We have a passenger.
Sergei!
Open all of them!
Oh God!
Oh God oh God oh God. ..
Sergei, please tell me there's more to this plan!
Let's go. ..
Agent Hunt?
And you are?
Agent Carter.
Okay.
Who's your pal?
I'll tell you on the way!
Light the fuse.
Sergei, what's going on?
It's OK, Bogdan.
I don't mean to bring up the elephant in the room, but what's with the big, hairy Russian?
Who, Bogdan?
He fed me intel. If I left him there, they would've killed him.
So we're gonna give him his freedom.
Did you call in the sweepers?
On their way.
Good, good.
Benji, how is it you're here?
Oh, I passed the field exam.
Crazy, right?
Yeah.
Crazy.
-DNA test.
-It's me.
It's procedure.
I'm just confirming it's you.
-You're very thorough.
-Sergei?
Are you not Russian?
Relax.
Sweepers approaching!
Brooms are out!
-Roger that.
-Sergei.
Are you not Sergei?
You'll be fine.
Bogdan.
I always take care of my friends.
My friend.
Messy bringing him along.
I thought it went rather well.
Mind telling me what you were doing in a Russian prison?
Mind telling me why you broke me out?
This wasn't a rescue mission?
Let me put it this way.
If the Secretary wanted me out of there, it must be pretty bad out here.
We were after a file.
We lost it.
"We"?
Who lost it?
You?
Agent Hanaway.
Where's Hanaway?
It was a letter drop.
Classified file.
It should have been a simple intercept.
ETA, two minutes on the courier.
But there was one thing we didn't know.
Bobcat, your train's six minutes out.
Who the courier was.
It's now or never, Bobcat.
The courier delivering the file, what's his name?
Go ahead. Shoot.
We are out of time.
I need a name, folks. I can't track all these people at once.
Marek.
Stefanski.
For the love of God!
You got it?
Marek Stefanski.
Searching.
I'll take it from here.
Hey, you all right, buddy?
Hanaway dropped the mark and grabbed his bag.
Sit down.
Catch your breath.
He had the file in his hands. Easy in, easy out.
File secured.
But we weren't the only ones after it.
Bobcat, someone else has crashed this party.
I'm not alone.
Local police?
No. Armed hostiles.
Hang tight, I'm coming! Outrigger, back him up.
Negative, Outrigger.
Rendezvous southwest corner, 60 seconds.
Hanaway's lens cam drew a facial match and triggered a warning.
But it was too late.
No!
You're going to be okay.
You're so beautiful.
I'm sorry, I. ..
I should have told you.
It was my op.
I put him in the field.
And she left him just alive enough for me to see him die.
I'm sorry.
You know her?
That's Sabine Moreau.
Contract killer.
Works for diamonds.
What was in the file?
Russian nuclear launch codes.
IMF's been looking for an emerging extremist, code name, Cobalt.
He's determined to detonate a nuclear weapon however he can.
We know Moreau's worked for him before.
What else does IMF know about him?
As much as you do now.
But if Moreau has nuclear launch codes, you can bet Cobalt's gone from a person of interest to enemy number one.
We're here.
Agent confirmed.
Why was he in prison?
He disappeared after he and his wife.. . You know.
I thought he'd just been transferred. Put on leave.
There were rumors, though. Talk of an unsanctioned hit.
Welcome back, Mr. Hunt.
In your absence, IMF has learned that Cobalt is or was a level-1 nuclear strategist for Russian intelligence.
Therefore, the only way to uncover his actual identity is to infiltrate the Kremlin itself.
In order to get past their checkpoints, you'll be impersonating General Anatoly Fedorov.
We believe Cobalt will do everything he can to destroy any record of his identity.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to penetrate the highly-secured archive inside the Kremlin and retrieve Cobalt's file before he can destroy it.
New intel suggests Cobalt is already en route, leaving you. ..
...4 hours 52 minutes to infiltrate.
To save time, we've chosen your team for you.
Agents Carter and Dunn.
As always, should you or any member of your team be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.
This message will self-destruct in five seconds.
Good luck, Ethan.
What do you got?
We're going into the Kremlin.
I thought you said "The Kremlin."
Okay.
This is very exciting.
Being out in the field.
With you, you know.
It's a bit of a dream for me.
Love your disguise, by the way.
You look just like him.
It's a shame we're not wearing masks. You know, like, full masks.
Everybody gets to wear a mask but Benji.
Sorry.
I'm tense. I babble when I'm nervous.
I'm doing it again.
Shut up, Benji.
Okay, seven security guards.
X-ray machines.
Cameras.
Metal detectors.
Just what we expected.
We can do this.
Releasing in three, two, one.
Game face, game face.
Kremlin game face.
General.. .
I am Major Egorov.
Your documents.
You should know your boss.
I can't find you.
Run it again.. .
.. .Private.
Egorov.
Excuse me, General.
I didn't recognize you.
You're going to regret this, Egorov.
I think that went quite well.
Just shut it.
Sorry.
It's going to work.
I'm sorry, by the way. About you and Julia.
You know, not working out.
I wanted to say something before you went away, but. ..
I liked her, you know.
He's off the phone now.
It's empty.
The nest is empty.
Check in, Team Leader.
Over.
Repeat.
Check in, Team Leader.
Have you made it to the Archive Room?
Captain!
The Archive Room!
Run!
Someone is piggybacking our frequency.
Team Leader, awaiting your go-sign.
Abort.
Rendezvous nine-two.
Shut the gate!
Quickly!
Our media is no more truthful than yours,
American.
But we both know that the real cause of the explosion was you.
Awaiting your go-sign, Team Leader.
Standing by to detonate.
The worst part for you,
"Team Leader,"
is I am the man assigned to make you suffer for it.
For what you did to my country.
This is a hospital. ..
Not a night club.
Misha. ..help me here.. .
Room twelve.
The doctors say he's lucky to be alive.
Only a mild concussion.
I don't give a damn about his health.
I have questions that need answering.
Be careful!
Prepare a transport.
Check over there!
Not a good idea.
It seemed like one a minute ago.
All agents!
Hot target heading west!
How may I help you?
SAT 20.
Agent 82-Delta-Echo requesting immediate evac.
Rendezvous Alpha 1 13.
Confirmed.
Alpha 113.
Details surrounding the intricate system of gas lines that run beneath the square are still forthcoming, but the majority of those lines date back to the Soviet era and have not been updated in at least. ..
Anna.. .
Anna. ..
I've been thinking.. .
It looks like we.. .
We should leave town for a couple of days.
Alex, you, me.
Vacations.
-Now?
-Tonight.
Why are you speaking in English?
Just.. .
Just the three of us.
.. .may not have been an accident, but a targeted attack.
Preliminary numbers are just starting. ..
Where will we go?
.. .to come in regarding those wounded in the blast.
We can confirm that 11 tourists...
Leonid?
. ..their nationalities still unconfirmed, have been transported to area hospitals for treatment.
While Russian officials continue to blame a gas-main break, experts are citing the shape of the blast area and the size of the debris field as more consistent with that of a set explosive, leading to speculation that this may have been
an undeclared act of aggression.
Although the Defense Ministry is maintaining that this is strictly an accident. ..
Anna, pack a bag for Alex.
We're leaving now.
Anya!
We have work to do.
Mr. Secretary.
I wasn't aware you were in Russia.
I'm not.
Not since a bomb blew up the Kremlin.
Yesterday I flew in to accept the Order of Friendship from the Russian Prime Minister.
Now I'm headed back to Washington to hand the President my resignation.
My Chief Analyst, William Brandt.
Do you have a pen?
-Pardon me?
-A pen.
Yeah.
Ethan, what happened in the Kremlin?
Chief Analyst, you say?
If you're implying that I made a bad call.. .
European male.
Fifties.
About six-foot, 180 pounds.
Blue eyes.
Who is he?
A crude drawing, but by your description, that could be Kurt Hendricks.
190 IQ.
Served in Swedish Special Forces.
Professor of physics, Stockholm University.
Specialist in nuclear endgame theory.
Asked to resign.. .
Well, because he's crazy.
Cobalt.
You have to alert the Kremlin that one of their strategists has a nuclear launch device and one of his operatives has the codes to activate it.
And what makes you say that?
I saw him leaving the executive armory, bag in hand.
He set off that explosion to cover his tracks.
It could be weeks before the Russians know it's missing.
Unless we tell them.
They won't listen to us.
As far as the Russians are concerned, we just bombed the Kremlin.
The tension between the United States and Russia hasn't been this high since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
And the blame, right or wrong, points to IMF.
The President has initiated Ghost Protocol.
The entire IMF has been disavowed.
So what happens now?
Now, I've been ordered to take you back to Washington, where the DOD will label you as a rogue extremist and hang the Kremlin bombing on you and your team.
Unless, you were to escape somewhere between here and the airport, having assaulted Mr. Brandt and me.
Sir?
You would then illegally scrounge whatever material you could from a backup supply cache that I've overlooked.
The same cache where your team are waiting for further orders.
Sir, you may want to. ..
You will then disappear, and this conversation never having taken place, your intentions would be unclear.
But if any one of your team is caught or killed, they will be branded terrorists, out to incite global nuclear war.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it.
Ethan, you were my best man.
And I'm sorry it's come to this, after all the sacrifices you made.
If we don't meet again, I just want you to know,
I've always considered you a friend.
Stay down!
Drive, drive, drive!
You okay?
Yeah.
Take a deep breath.
Stay with me.
-Ready?
-Yeah.
What do we do?
Wait here.
Where else am I going to go?
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Weapons down!
What are you firing at?
Two prisoners escaped from Rankow Prison today.
And this one?
.. .
What do we know about him?
Why would that work?
Why would what work?
The flare on the body, why would that work?
It did work.
-Yeah, I know, but.. .
-Hey!
But why?
I mean, how did you know that would draw their fire?
I didn't.
I played a hunch.
Okay.
All right, so what was your scenario?
Right, you. .. There's a guy being shot at in the water.
All of a sudden, decides to light up a flare and swim around?
I mean, what did you assume they'd be thinking?
-Thinking?
-Yeah.
I didn't assume they were thinking.
I assumed they were shooting at anything that moved.
I just gave them a target. Look, these. ..
These guys aren't Rhodes Scholars, you know?
It's really happening, isn't it?
Yeah.
Okay, you know what that sound is?
That's our ride out of here!
All right, it's a green car.
Number 47.
I see green!
Okay, let's do it.
Go, go, go, go.
All right, 47.
I don't see it.
47.
Oh, shit!
This is it. The manifest.
Enter your code.
Press enter.
Retinal scanner!
Retinal scan required.
Watch out!
Retinal scan required.
Agent confirmed.
Ethan?
Jeez, I thought you were dead!
-We are. -Who's this?
Agents Dunn and Carter.
William Brandt, Chief Analyst.
Analyst?
Agent confirmed.
How will the world finally end?
It is my job to predict the unthinkable.
To treat the death of billions as a game.
After 20 years of this, I was numb.
Until a new question crossed my mind.
What happens after the end of the world?
Are you sure your line is secure?
Every two or three million years.. .
Are you certain your line is secure?
. ..some natural catastrophe devastates all life on Earth.
But life goes on.
And what little remains is made stronger.
Put simply, world destruction is an unpleasant, but necessary part of evolution.
What happens then, I wondered, when mankind faces the next end of the world?
I don't care what you have to do to get him to Dubai.
I'll make it worth his while.
Just do it.
I looked to Hiroshima, Nagasaki.. .
I'll be waiting for your call.
. ..thriving cities rebuilt from the ashes, monuments to the unimaginable, dedicated to the concept of peace.
It occurred to me here that nuclear war might have a place in the natural order.
But only if it could be controlled.
Only if it touched every living soul equally.
IMF now believes this man, Kurt Hendricks, is the nuclear extremist, code name Cobalt.
Today he was seen leaving the Kremlin, with what is likely a nuclear launch device.
Two days ago, Sabine Moreau killed one of our agents in Budapest and relieved him of Russian nuclear launch codes.
Intel indicates she will check into the Burj Hotel in Dubai in 36 hours.
Marius Wistrom is a known operative of Cobalt.
Wistrom is currently en route to Dubai.
For the launch device to work, Cobalt needs the activation codes.
He's sending Wistrom to buy them from Moreau.
The Secretary is dead.
The President has invoked Ghost Protocol.
We're shut down.
No satellite, safe house, support, or extraction.
The four of us and the contents of this car are all that remain of the IMF.
And as of this moment, any action is unsanctioned.
So if you want out, speak now.
Our mission is Hendricks.
We're all that stands between him and his goal.
Nothing can be left to chance.
Everyone connected with this man is considered an asset with valuable information about our target.
No one can know we're still on line.
We lose Hendricks now, we lose him forever.
So, what's the play?
Wistrom will take delivery from Moreau in 36 hours.
Now we cannot let the launch codes leave the hotel, but we need Wistrom to lead us to Hendricks.
He'll only do that if he has the codes.
Or if he thinks he has them.
Our objective is to intercept the sale, replace the authentic codes with counterfeits and follow Wistrom to Hendricks.
Well, that's simple enough.
We snatch the codes, we gin up some fakes.
Jane, you double Moreau, and sell the codes to Wistrom and Bob's your uncle.
And how do you propose we just snatch the codes from Moreau?
We take her out.
Yeah, we take her out. But, you know, discreetly.
Discreetly?
Yeah.
Right, she's an asset. Right. I get it.
He said. ..
I'm spitballing.
It's not all gonna be gold.
-We don't touch Wistrom.
-All right.
Or Moreau.
She'll answer for Hanaway, but it has to be when I say.
After we hit Hendricks.
Only pack what we need.
Yeah, absolutely. Only pack what we.. .
You never know.
So even if we can double Wistrom and Moreau, how do we keep them in separate rooms while having them think that they're in the same room?
We give the hotel a facelift.
Wistrom will think he's arriving at Moreau's suite, but, really, he'll be walking into our decoy room.
Where I'll double Moreau.
Downstairs, Benji will double Wistrom.
Masks!
And meet with the real Moreau.
And.. .
What am I doing?
You?
You're the helper!
Helper.
That's great.
Okay, so to the extent I understand what you're talking about here. ..
The Burj Khalifa, it's the tallest building in the world, and you want to alter its infrastructure with the hopes of convincing two people that they've had a meeting, which actually really never happened.
Right?
Camels.
ETA on dry cleaning.
On my way up.
Okay, 34 minutes to door knock.
Wow. ..
Okay, this is a slight wrinkle, but nothing to worry about.
We're just going to have to go into the server room from the outside.
What?
Well, the firewalls on this building's server are military grade.
I mean, this would be a cinch if I could call Youssef back at headquarters, but Youssef doesn't exist anymore, and neither do we.
I could hack it, but it would take too long.
Then hardwire in.
And there's four layers of next-gen security between us and the server room.
There's no way we can get to it from inside.
If we can't get to the server, we don't control the elevators, we don't control the security cameras.
This operation is over before it even begins.
I'm telling you, we can get to it from outside.
"We"?
I'm. ..
I'm on the computer.
I'm just.. .
The helper.
What floor is it on?
130.
130?
-Vent ducts.
-Pressure sensitive.
Not enough time.
-Elevator shaft.
-Infrared sensors.
Not enough time.
How am I supposed to do this?
God damn it!
Oh, that's high.
Okay, now remember, it's a rolling off motion that disengages the bond.
When the meter is blue, that's full adhesion.
Easy way to remember, blue is glue.
-And when it's red?
-Dead.
Here's your cutter, okay?
And your server interface.
Both going back here.
One, two.
Okay, Ethan, the hotel server is eleven stories up and seven units over.
Okay?
Comm check.
Yeah.
Copy.
So. ..
It's 26 minutes to door knock.
Yeah.
25 minutes to door knock.
What the hell is that?
Yeah, what the hell is that?
It's a sandstorm.
It's a long way off, Ethan.
Shouldn't be a problem.
24 minutes to door knock.
Where's Ethan?
You've got to be kidding me.
23 minutes to door knock.
I'm at server level.
22 minutes to door knock.
The countdown is not helping.
I'm just saying.
I'm in.
That's great, Ethan.
You're halfway home.
Located server.
Please tell me we're online.
All right, we're live.
Okay, I now have control of the elevators and the security cameras.
Time to redecorate.
Okay, you drive.
And look out for Wistrom and Moreau.
Moreau is at the elevators ahead of schedule.
Go.
We can't open this door, can we?
The door?
No.
Ethan, you gotta get down here now.
Ethan!
Is there a problem?
Ethan?
We're not gonna make it.
We have to make it.
Where's Ethan?
Your line's not long enough!
No shit!
That was not easy, but I did it.
What'd I miss?
The lens might be a little uncomfortable.
It captures images and transmits them to the printer in the briefcase.
All right?
I can't see out of one eye, but I'm fine.
Blink twice to activate the shutter.
Notice the numbers are in order?
A perfect copy.
But the numbers are scrambled.
Masks?
60 seconds.
You sure I shouldn't wear a mask?
You know, 'cause I'm not exactly Omar Sharif.
I'll play it French.
This is your tracking device.
-This is what you're tracking.
-The paper clip?
No, it's the paper.
It's in the briefcase.
It's coated with isotopes which give off a unique.. .
It just means that you can track the documents even if they switch briefcases.
Range?
Not that good.
It's, like, half a mile.
Safest thing to do would be not let Wistrom out of your sight.
Is that Wistrom?
Who's that with him?
I don't know.
We don't have an uplink, so there's no facial recognition.
Who's that with him?
That's Leonid Lisenker.
Polish-born cryptographer.
He redesigned Russia's nuclear security after the Cold War.
He's here to authenticate the launch codes.
-Yes, he is.
We are blown.
-No, we're not blown.
Well, we will be as soon as he sees the counterfeit launch codes.
We're not blown.
He's in the elevator.
Delay them.
Benji, how long would it take you to reprogram the case?
A couple of seconds.
What for, though?
To make an exact copy of the launch codes.
-What?
-You can't do that.
-Wistrom's on 22!
-Slow him down.
I'll do what I can.
Wait, wait.
Ethan, hang on now!
Hang on.
Just a second.
You're talking about handing over active nuclear launch codes to Wistrom?
Yes.
Reprogram the case.
Listen.. .
Stop!
Just listen to what you're saying.
You're fixating.
You're not thinking clearly.
It's not gonna happen.
I won't let it!
33 and climbing!
Brandt, use your head now.
The mission is not the codes, the mission is Hendricks.
Then just let it play out.
Give him bad codes.
Neutralize him.
You know that won't do it.
Failure to a terrorist is just a rehearsal for success.
41!
We lose Hendricks today, he shows up somewhere else tomorrow.
He finds another way.
With no IMF to stop him.
No.
It's now or never.
Now, Brandt, give me the case.
Nothing can be left to chance.
You said that.
You're the analyst.
Now, tell me there's not another way for Hendricks to get those codes.
50!
You tell me that this is his only avenue, right here, right now, today.
You tell me that, I'll walk away.
-We go without.
-Without masks?
-Jane needs to go.
-Ethan!
We have no choice.
Ethan, you'd be walking in on Moreau unarmed.
Face-first. Literally.
How do we know they've met?
-How do we know they haven't?
-Doesn't matter!
Damn it.
We have no choice.
Goggles.
What if they have met?
Come in.
Which one of you is Wistrom?
I am.
I admire your work.
Sit.
Where are my codes?
Where are my diamonds?
Close by.
You have my payment?
When I see the codes.
Not to worry.
Come in!
I thought we could have tea.
No diamonds, no codes.
No codes, no diamonds.
Kill this one.
We didn't come alone.
That hallway out there is a kill-box.
You know who we work for.
We come back with the codes, or we don't come back.
How good is your backup?
The best.
I've killed the best.
Do you care for some sugar?
Enough. Let's get this done.
You want payment, I want guarantees.
When he's authenticated the codes,
I'll make the call and you get your diamonds.
That or we all go home in buckets.
Nobody leaves this hotel alive.
Get the papers.
Is there a problem?
It's locked.
Forgive me.
There must be a key.
One moment, huh?
My mistake.
It is a combination, not a key.
You tell me the numbers.
They're good.
Zero.
Come on, come on, come on.
It was a pleasure doing business with.. .
Wistrom has the launch codes.
He's on the move.
Hey, I did as you asked.
I did. Now let my family go!
Release Leonid's family.
Thank God.
You can thank him in person.
It was a pleasure doing business with you.
Kill him!
Moreau's on the move!
I've got her.
Jane?
She's an asset!
I need her alive!
Acknowledge!
Ethan, Wistrom is in the elevator. I can't see Leonid, though.
Benji, slow him down.
Get me an elevator.
Find Leonid.
Benji, I've got a lock on Wistrom.
But I can't tell.
Is he still in the elevator?
Benji?
Ethan. Over?
Benji.
Benji, I lost. ..
Ethan, can you hear me?
Ethan, can you hear me? Over.
Jesus!
Sit down!
-Watch her.
-Why me?
Because if I do, I'll kill her.
Hold it, Team Leader.
Did you really think I wouldn't catch up with you?
You and I are not enemies.
It was a set-up.. .
We'll find out your lies soon enough.
Move it!
I'm sorry about this.
Leonid.
Benji?
Go for Benji.
I've got Leonid by the elevators.
He's been shot.
What?
Hey, hey.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Jane!
No!
Come on.
Come on.
Now, what happened with Moreau, Jane?
She couldn't help us with Hendricks.
So let's throw her off the building!
I didn't throw her.
Let's throw her off the building!
She was not the mission, Jane!
The mission was to track the file back to Hendricks, who is in the wind with nuclear launch codes!
Maybe you didn't notice the gun she had pointed at me.
Yeah, like you didn't notice the open window, or that we're about a mile up in the air!
It was an instinctive move.
It doesn't matter!
We're talking about a nuclear war.
The asset is more important than you.
Where do you get off telling me how well I executed?
We inherited you.
Better have good news for me.
Is he here?
Yeah, I got it.
Dunhill lighter.
I'll be there.
And no one will be following me.
Just make sure no one's following you.
And how the hell did the Russians find us?
-What are you asking me for?
-Because you're communications!
You're in charge of covering our tracks.
You cannot afford to make mistakes like that now, Benji.
You're not a technician anymore.
You're a field agent.
And you're just an "analyst."
Right?
Who are you really, Brandt?
-What are you asking?
-What am I asking?
Let me see if I can put it another way.
How does an agent with skills like that end up an analyst?
Well, we all have our secrets.
Don't we, Ethan?
You tell me yours, I'll tell you mine.
I have friends in the region.
Just sit tight.
I'll send someone to get you out of here.
What about Hendricks?
What's the plan?
The plan was for us to stop him together.
Well, what are you going to do?
Change the plan.
Wait.
That's it?
What are you going to do, go after him alone?
Would you care to explain yourself, Agent Brandt?
I was on a protection detail in Croatia.
Shadowing the assets, husband and wife.
They were never supposed to know we were there.
Whole thing's routine, it was a milk run.
Three days in we caught wind that a Serbian hit squad was after our couple.
But my team had it under control.
We knew they were coming.
But I couldn't shake this feeling that I should warn the couple somehow.
I wanted to find a way to let them know.
But, you know, orders are orders, so I didn't.
One day, the husband decides to leave the hotel and go for a run, so I follow him, and I leave two men with the wife.
When I get back, my guys are unconscious and the wife is gone.
Local police found her body three days later.
What was left of her, anyway.
That was my last day in the field.
I couldn't face another life-or-death situation after that.
So what happened to the husband?
I never saw him again.
Until two days ago in Moscow, when the Secretary introduced me to Ethan Hunt.
No, that's not what happened.
Yeah, I heard that one, too, Benji.
But, unfortunately, I was there.
Just like I was there when the Secretary got the phone call that Ethan was in custody for killing six Serbian nationals in cold blood.
An unsanctioned hit.
Yeah.
Disavowed.
The next thing I know,
I'm on a plane to Dubai, wondering the whole time, do I tell him?
How do I tell him?
That I'm responsible.
I could have warned him.
I should have warned him.
But I didn't.
And she died.
Sergei!
Sergei, my friend!
I told you I would get him here.
Didn't I say?
How do I know it's him?
Yes, it's him.
You trust me, I trust you.
Right?
This is the guy!
This is the guy, the one I told you about.
So we can take these things off.
Sorry.
He's a great guy, but he doesn't know you like I do.
So, you work for the American government.
And you're an arms dealer.
No, no, no.
Sergei.
Sergei.
He's "independent defense coordinator." Right?
That you are.
Very classy job.
Listen. He's a friend.
Those diamonds are for Bogdan.
No, no.
It's okay.
You can have them.
Whatever arrangements you made with my cousin is between you and him.
You want something from me, you pay.
You misunderstand. I'm not buying. I'm selling.
You're selling.
Selling what?
The future.
Yeah, I got all I need, thank you.
Our countries are on the brink of war.
War is very good for business.
Nuclear war?
Go on.
I'm looking for a man named Kurt Hendricks.
You may know him as Cobalt.
In either case, I think you know what he wants.
I'll bet he even tried to buy it from you at some point.
Go on.
He has a case, he has codes.
But they're worthless without a tactical satellite.
I want to know where he'd get it.
A man with information like that would be a potential terrorist.
And to your government, a potential terrorist is a terrorist.
If you help me, my friends become your friends.
Sorry.
I cannot help you.
I certainly cannot tell you that Russia quietly sold an obsolete tactical satellite to a certain telecom in Mumbai.
And whoever gave them that idea?
An enterprising third party.
Working on commission.
Helping old friends.
Making new ones.
Can the satellite be shut down?
That would take special skills, and you cannot do it alone.
What's in the bags?
It's our gear.
How'd you get it?
Made a friend.
Well, I'm glad we could help.
You could help now.
Look, Ethan, before we.. .
Whatever happened, happened.
We still have a chance to clean this up, but we have to do it now.
And we have to do it together.
Okay. So, where are we going?
India.
-India?
India?
-Sure.
Okay.
Great.
Love the jet.
Wait till you see the car.
Sidorov.
How have you been, old friend?
Oh, it's you.
I've been busy with other things.
But I'll be after you again soon enough.
I understand you're looking for an American. ..
I am.
You're also looking for a nuclear launch device stolen from the Kremlin two days ago.
I am?
I can help you find both.
If.. . we can come to an understanding.
Brij Nath.
Brij Nath.
Playboy.
Multimedia tycoon.
On the surface, his entire network is state-of-the-art.
But it's built on illegally acquired
Cold War cast-offs, including this, the Novosti satellite.
Hendricks needs it to launch a nuclear strike, and we have to shut it down before he gets that chance.
And to do that, we need to get the access code from him.
One way or another.
And if I don't, none of this works.
You can do this.
Yeah.
A week ago, I would have believed you.
I don't blame you for what happened.
That's not something you just let go.
Did it make you feel better?
When you killed the men who killed your wife?
We can't get them back.
Okay, to shut down the satellite, we have to manually tap into the central server.
You'll enter through the exhaust vent, wearing this under your suit.
Drop down into the computer array, and I'll catch you, then move you along the relay room and you jack into the panel.
Okay, so we enter the party separately as guests.
Ethan quarterbacks while Jane.. .
Gets the codes from the billionaire.
I switch off the fan, you jump into the computer array, and I catch you, you plug in the transmitter then Ethan feeds me the codes which I then use to pinpoint Hendricks' location.
Okay, but you just breezed over something I think is really important.
The computer array part, where I just.. .
Jump?
-And I catch you.
-Yeah.
I don't. ..
Why is that so hard to grasp?
Well. ..
Why?
It's a 25-foot drop.
And we're using magnets.
Yeah.
In light of our recent efforts, the technology's. ..
The science is sound.
All right?
I'd be more worried about the heat.
And then there's that.
What heat?
Well, it's like any computer, isn't it?
If you switch off the fan, it's gonna get really hot!
Of course.
Relatively, you know.
Of course it will.
So I'm jumping into a. ..
An oven, essentially.
Yeah.
Essentially.
But I'll catch you.
Great.
Aapka swagat hai, sir. Welcome, sir.
Comm check.
Saturn's got your five-by-five, Jupiter.
This is Pluto.
I have arrived at the party.
There he is.
Get us that code.
Venus moving in on target.
Hook's in.
You do make an impression.
Why am I Pluto?
It's not even a planet anymore.
Well, I think Uranus is available.
It's funny 'cause you said "anus."
I'm in position.
Sending in the Rover.
He's moving to you.
Give him your back.
Don't want to make it too easy for him.
Are you gonna be talking the whole time?
In 20 minutes, I want a glass of Cuv茅e Louis in every guest's hand.
And make sure all of them have a bottle to take home by the end of the night.
Sure.
Impressed yet?
I'm more of a bourbon girl.
I'm Brij Nath.
Welcome to my humble home.
And Rover's in position.
Spinning down the turbine.
He's e-mailing.
Venus. Be Venus.
Be Venus.
Husband?
Boyfriend?
More of a co-worker.
Saturn, take the leap.
Okay.
Jumping.
Jumping now.
Jump now?
Yes.
Commit. Jump.
-Jump.
-Jump.
-And I catch you.
-Now.
So, you're sure about this suit, right, Benji?
Pretty sure.
Now you're pretty sure?
Jump.
Oh, God.
All right.
Jump.
Jump!
Jupiter, he's gone.
Did you jump?
Should I not have jumped?
'Cause I jumped!
Stand by.
I'm playing a hunch.
Don't hit me.
Hello?
My God, you are a passionate creature.
I would like to show you my collection of art.
I was waiting for you to ask.
Then you have to find me.
You're on.
I'm heading upstairs.
All right, now be careful, because it's probably getting a bit hot.
We have to get to that satellite before Hendricks does.
Look left.
Look up.
I find your capricious passion intriguing.
Let me tell you one thing. He's not your type.
Completely not your type.
He's completely cold.
I'm hot.
Like all Indian men, I'm very hot.
Eight o'clock.
Hot!
Very hot.
He's at your eight o'clock.
As you move towards me, you're getting hotter.
Whoa. Up, up!
Up, up!
Too much, too much, too much!
I see you.
I'd heard you have one of the finest private collections in the world.
Well, at the very least, it's private.
Saturn?
How we doing in the relay room?
In position.
I see the satellite.
Can I help you, gentlemen?
I don't think so.
Need those codes, guys.
All originals from Chhatarpur District.
You know, the Tantrics believe that the Swadhisthana chakra hides our most subconscious of desires.
Uplink to satellite.
Reboot to original military specs.
Download the virus.
What the hell is that?
What the hell is what?
It's going haywire!
It's downloaded a virus from the satellite.
Hendricks is killing the server before we can kill the satellite.
Hendricks is reprogramming the satellite.
He's gonna have launch capability in five minutes!
-Something wrong?
-No.
Jane, you gotta move.
We need that code.
Finally we're alone.
Venus, now's the time.
Kick his ass and get the code.
We are alone, aren't we?
No one will interrupt us.
Move and I break your neck.
The override sequence for the relay station.
Say it now or never speak again.
The codes.
46, 82, 93.
Benji, what happened?
The system's crashed!
We're too late.
No, no, no.
He's revealed himself.
Benji, can you pinpoint Hendricks' location?
Hendricks is signaling out of a state-run
TV station 6.7 miles from here.
Send me the coordinates.
Good work, Brandt.
Now get the hell out of there.
Back me up!
Jane, tie it off with Nath and meet me at the rally point.
Sleep tight
Faster, Benji!
Just straight through!
Wait!
Stop!
Take me through!
It's not responding!
A little bit of patience would be appreciated!
I can't reach the top!
More fan!
More fan!
More fan!
There's nothing I can do!
It's maxed out!
Brandt?
Next time, I get to seduce the rich guy.
Satellite weaponized and online.
Upload the new authentication codes.
Lock Russian Central Command out of the system.
Isolate the sub.
We'll fire just one missile, an apparent retaliation for the Kremlin.
That should start the ball rolling.
I'm here, Ethan.
How long until Hendricks can launch a missile?
Less than 30 seconds!
We need another route.
Turn left up ahead, take the alley on the right.
We have uplink.
Ethan, Hendricks has started the launch sequence.
How much time until missiles are flying?
Three minutes!
We're three and a half minutes out.
We can make it.
Captain.. .
Connect to Central Command for launch verification.
Right away.
Proceed with Operation "Iron Fist".
Command to Launch is confirmed.
Cease all further communication.
Over and out.
Next left.
Proceed.
Ethan?
We're too late.
The missile's in the air.
There has to be a way to abort the warhead.
If there is one, it'll be on the launch device.
We're gonna get that case.
May there be peace on Earth.
Disable the relay.
Get Wistrom!
Inside, inside!
Wistrom destroyed the relay.
Ethan went after Hendricks and the case, but.. .
Doesn't matter if he has the case.
We can't transmit the abort codes.
Can you fix it?
Yeah.. .
It's gonna be pointless if we don't have any power.
Wistrom!
-Jane!
-I'm okay.
No, you are not okay. She's hit.
You stay here and cover Benji.
Benji, get this thing rewired and back online.
I'll get the power on.
We can do this.
I'm taking that briefcase!
No!
No!
He's been gone too long.
Damn it!
Listen.
When the power comes on, these two drives go into this bay, okay?
Mission accomplished!
Don't touch him!
This one is mine.
So, we are not enemies.
The phone call from that arms dealer in Dubai.
You wanted me to find you.
How else to believe this?
Hospital?
And in other news, eight weeks later, the debate continues.
Eyewitnesses remain adamant that the object was some sort of aircraft, but officials with the Department of Defense insist it was simply a meteor large enough to be visible during daylight.
You actually said that.
Out loud.
"Mission accomplished."
I said it.
You're still corny, Ethan.
I can't imagine the look on that guy's face.
-Hey.
-This must be them.
Luther Stickell, the firm of Carter, Dunn and Brandt.
I blew an entire weekend on the bottom of the San Francisco Bay no thanks to you clowns.
No, man, you know I got this.
I know. I'll see you in Kandahar.
Thanks for meeting me.
So, I hear the insurance company's refusing to pay the claim on that car you crashed, Ethan.
Something about intentional 100-meter vertical drops not being covered.
Go figure.
How's the leg?
Still working.
You?
Healing.
I'm fine, by the way.
I mean, I'm not actually sleeping, per se.
You know. Cold sweats. Middle of the night.
All these people are just happy and smiling and they are completely oblivious to the fact that they were almost vaporized.
And if it hadn't been for. ..
Dumb luck?
Was it?
I mean, look, we were unprepared, in the dark.
Disavowed.
And the only thing that functioned properly on that mission was this team.
I don't know how we ended up together, but I'm glad we did.
Your missions.
Choose to accept them.
Hey, look, I'm in.
Seriously.
It's not as if any mission is gonna be rougher than the last one, is it?
I mean, that's just.. .
Bomb. ..
Is it?
Thanks, Ethan.
Thank you.
Agent Hunt.
Agent Carter.
Brandt.
I'm not picking up that phone, Ethan, because I don't think you want me in the field.
I know your wife is dead.
I was there in Croatia.
I was there for one reason.
One.
And I failed.
It was my job to protect her.
How do you know she's dead?
There was a body.
Did you see it?
You killed those Serbians.
I had to get her back.
You were sent to Rankow Prison.
That was a sacrifice I was willing to make.
IMF suspected Hendricks had people in Rankow.
And six dead Serbians was the ideal cover.
Waste not, want not.
The Secretary never told me.
I accepted the Rankow Prison mission on one condition :
That no one could know she was still alive.
But you're telling me.
When did you find out that I was in Croatia?
I pulled your file after India.
Right.
So you had to fake your wife's death.
As long as we were together, she could never be safe.
It wasn't your job to protect her, Brandt.
It's mine.
Okay.
So we're good.
We're good.
Come on!
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.
36 hours ago, there was a breach in our military's communication network.
Now, an emerging terror organization known as The Syndicate has control of our entire drone fleet.
Their targets:
Unknown.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it.. .
Johnny English.
Five years ago, he was our top agent.
Yeah.
Took his eye off the ball in Mozambique.
Does it have to be him? He's the only one our contact will talk to.
So where is he?
You came here to forget your life of shame.
But the path you must tread to new life will be not be easy, English.
Our purpose here is simple.
To strengthen what is weak.
Make hard what is soft.
This will take time.
Mind must be master of the body.
Strong mind can separate the body from its suffering.
Good concentration, English.
Sorry?
Hot!
Hot! Hot!
Hot!
You are not young.
But with age comes wisdom. When mind is master of the body, you will be warrior once more.
Master, what is my destiny?
I'm in touch with a higher power.
MI7 wants you on the first flight back to London
Master, am I ready?
No.
Window seat or aisle?
One moment, please. Good morning, sir.
Toshiba British Intelligence.
For electronic products press one.
To speak to an agent, press two.
Certainly, sir.
Can I redirect you to our website?
Toshiba British Intelligence.
Good morning, sir.
Johnny English.
Pegasus is expecting you.
Look into the camera.
Don't smile.
Pamela Thornton, Head of Ml?
Johnny English.
Have a seat.
You've been away for some time, English.
But you haven't been forgotten.
Come on.
People here often talk about your adventures in Mozambique.
Well, Ml? has come a long way since then
The guns, the fast cars, and the chauvinism are all on their way out. Frankly, I didn't want to see you back.
You are everything I came into this service to change.
But my hands are tied.
And there are times when one has to go against one's better judgement.
We have a situation.
Indeed.
There's a good puss. There's a good puss.
There's a good pussy. Who's a good pussy?
- I'm impressed.
- Who's a good pussy?
Philby never lets strangers pick him up.
I'm very much atone with the animal kingdom.
There's a good puss. I know, I know. Who's lovely?
Who... We're all lovely.
Kate Sumner, our behavioural psychologist.
I've heard a great deal about you.
Glowing reports, I trust.
Tell me, Ms Sumner, what exactly does a behavioural psychologist do?
Monitor observable behaviour for signs of internal psychology.
We read people.
Well, we must get together sometime. I think you'll find me a real page-turner. Ah.
So, Pegasus, this situation.
Ex-CIA agent Titus Fisher has contacted us from Hong Kong.
He has intelligence of a plot to assassinate the Chinese Premier at the Anglo-Chinese talks next week.
We need you to go and find out what he's got.
Well, in that case, Pegasus, count me in.
Agent One will meet you downstairs.
So, I just scaled the walls, blew the whole place to kingdom come.
An hour later I'm sitting in the bar with a White Russian in my hand.
Who was very lovely, too, I can tell you.
Simon.
Hello, Johnny!
Simon, you look wonderful. But, then, you always did.
Welcome back. How long has it been?
I don't know.
Five years, three months and six days, or something.
Of course, Mozambique.
That was a balls-up with a cherry on top.
Come on, let's get you sorted.
Welcome to the toy cupboard.
I won't leave you my number.
You know Patch.
Patch Quartermain, the man himself.
English.
Please, don't get up.
No chance of that.
Lost them testing the B-6 exploding brogues.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
How are you?
Have to be this one, I'm afraid.
Lost this to the D-10 doorbell.
Ah.
Well, it's great to see what's left of you
This is rather good fun, actually.
Top speed of 60 mph, and I've managed to add the odd thing.
This way. I haven't got all day.
Don't!
Would you stop meddling, English?
Here she is.
Ah, the Rolls-Royce Phantom.
Truly the Rolls-Royce of automobiles.
Armour plating, all the bells and whistles.
Say "Bonnet."
- Bonnet.
- Command accepted.
Voice activation recognises only you.
Rolls has fitted one of their experimental engines.
The nine-litre V16. Goes like the wind.
Only quieter.
Beautiful.
Keep up!
Here's what you'll be taking to Hong Kong.
- Ah, yes.
- A satellite receiver, tracking device, Semtex chewing gum.
Now, what did I just say?
That's the new P-two digital dart gun. Gentlemen.
May I remind you all that MI7's current weapon of choice is dialogue?
Fisher will contact you there.
To ensure protocol is observed,
I'm sending someone with you.
Agent Tucker.
You made a laughing stock out of this service once, English.
Not on my watch. Clear'?
Crystal clear, Pegasus. Just like old times, eh, Johnny?
I'm off to Switzerland. Let's catch up when you get back.
There's nothing I'd like more, Simon. Has anyone seen the voice-changing travel lozenges?
Um...
Come on, Tucker.
I'm not 21 till September, sir.
I'm not really allowed in.
Tucker, you're an agent working for Her Majesty's Secret Service.
Just act the part.
Thank you.
And a receipt, please.
Be alert for contact, Tucker.
We're looking for a Chinese man in spectacles.
Would you like another drink, sir?
Sir, the Chinese man in spectacles.
- One more beer.
- No more bets, please.
Contact.
Evening.
Your grandmother is sick.
What?
Your grandmother is sick.
Well, she's dead.
Is he dead, sir? Yes.
- Hi, Mum.
- What's the matter?
No, no, no, no.
Nothing's the matter, no.
I felt a bit funny last night, but I'm okay now.
So, what have you got for us?
The people behind the plot to kill Xiang Ping, the Chinese Premier.
Never heard of them.
Come on, Fisher, I need names, I need evidence!
Vortex has a secret weapon.
This is one of three keys that, when used together, gain access to it.
Without this, Vortex is finished
How did you get hold of it?
It's mine.
Vortex is three of us.
Come off it, Fisher
You, a hired assassin?
You couldn't hit a barn door with a banana
And as for Vortex, clearly you got the name off a box of washing powder.
Vortex was in Mozambique.
What?
Yeah?
Really?
Mum?
Mum, Mum, I gotta go. Gotta go.
We were all there that day, Johnny-boy.
- Excuse me. Sir!
- What?
Sir, there's a...
Quick, come on! Come on!
Madam, let me help you with that.
Here.
Yes, I think you should vacate the area.
There are some very dangerous people about.
There we go.
Get after her, Tucker, get after her!
What?
Sir! Sir!
Over here, Tucker!
I lost her, sir.
Look what I found.
This way, sir!
This way!
You get down to the street. I'll take the roof.
You are not young.
Can I help?
I am commandeering this vessel in the name of Her Majesty.
Right-0, Wing Commander.
How exciting!
Now, what's your poison?
Can I get you something?
We've got vodka, rum.
Your safety is our priority.
But you can help us by familiarizing yourself with this leaflet.
Hello, Shirley.
Just a tad to your left, Shirley.
I say, Wing Commander!
- Well played, sir! Well played!
Well played!
More champagne, my lovely.
Certainly, sir.
Tucker' are you sure you don't want a Shandy or something?
I have got to finish this mission report, sir.
And Pegasus wants to see us as soon as we touchdown.
The mission report?
Oh, come on, Tucker.
You should learn to savour success.
Work hard, play hard.
Barbara?
Vortex is finished
But better still, for years I believed what happened in Mozambique was my fault.
Now I realise it was only partly my fault.
What did happen in Mozambique?
Excuse me, sir.
We're coming in to land.
Can I stow that overhead for you?
Certainly.
Sir, I don't think he's a "Susan."
But then you're not a linguist, are you, Tucker'?
It's not "Susan," it's "Shoooshan."
From the Xinzhou region, unless I'm very much mistaken.
Thank you, Shoooshan.
Foreign Secretary.
I hope you've got something for us, English.
The Prime Minister is extremely concerned.
He has every reason to be so.
There is a plot to kill the Chinese Premier.
Masterminded by a group of ruthless assassins called Vortex.
Good Lord.
The danger, however, has been averted.
Now that we have this.
- Now, I know what you're going to say, it's a pretty small object
Well, it's often the little things that pack the biggest punch.
The mighty Vortex has been slain by my possession of this small key.
Shoooshan.
Susan.
We got it, but Fisher talked.
Understood. We'll deal with English.
You've got some more cleaning to do.
Mummy, Mummy!
Mr Rhubarb's here!
Izzie, darling, why don't you show him into the conservatory?
I'll be with you in just a minute.
Okay.
Come on, come on, let's go!
Shall we?
Hurry up, Mr Rhubarb
Perhaps when you've found your key, you'll give me a call.
I'm very sorry, Foreign Secretary.
I had hoped to have more for you.
Pegasus!
I've got her!
Come on, you witch.
English?
She's the killer! She's my mother!
Couldn't she be both?
Mummy, Mummy, are you all right?
Let me get you a cup of tea.
- You'll be fine, Mummy.
- Who was that man?
Yeah, I think a cup of tea, that's what's required.
Pegasus, I am truly, truly sorry.
Don't apologise to me. Apologise to her.
I cannot apologise enough, Mrs Pegasus.
It was a simple case of mistaken identity, I'm afraid.
Now, I completely understand how upset you are, but I was hoping perhaps...
Sir!
Tucker!
That's her!
It's the killer from Hong Kong!
- No, it's not her, sir.
- It is! This time it's really her!
- It's not her, sir!
- Yes, it is!
Make way!
Sir.
You murderous crone!
Granny!
What's he doing?
Take that!
And that!
Hey!
I've got her this time, Pegasus!
This is the witch who works for Vortex!
Want any more' you old hag?
- English!
- Granny!
You humiliate me in front of the Foreign Secretary, you lose our only lead on Vortex, and then you try and kill my mother!
Twice!
Pegasus, we have another lead.
Vortex was in Mozambique!
They were responsible for the death of President Chambal!
Still, at least we know Vortex was in Mozambique.
When you told Pegasus, you displayed all four indicators of someone telling the truth.
This is a facial action coding system.
Its high-speed cameras record microexpressions, invisible to the naked eye.
It detects what we call emotional leakage.
Ms Sumner, I'm a trained agent.
I don't "leak."
I want to take you back to Mozambique. Is that really necessary?
Take a look at this.
I want to take you back to Mozambique.
There.
Could we call that leakage?
Now, play ball. I'm taking a risk being here after hours.
If Vortex was in Mozambique, perhaps you saw something.
I'm going to take you back there using hypnosis.
Spare me the new age mumbo jumbo. Mr English' please. I'm a professional.
I'm not going to just snap my fingers and make you say the first thing that comes into your head.
Plump pillows.
Excuse me?
Brilliant mind. Beautiful face.
Incredible.
And completely out of my league.
Mmm.
I'd like to take you back to Mozambique.
Tell me what's happening, Johnny.
Where are you?
President Chambal's inauguration day.
Yes, you're head of security.
Everything's going perfectly.
Today we climb the mountain!
Agent English.
The people have spoken, and the message is clear.
A future of peace and prosperity!
The backup electrical supply has been cut.
I should be getting back.
Well, operations like this are always difficult.
But it's very satisfying when you get a result.
The President couldn't be in safer hands. The future belongs to Mozambique!
Thank you. The fireworks have begun.
The sound of freedom and celebration. Easy, Johnny. Easy.
Before the Jacuzzi, what did you see?
Yes.
Fisher.
On the terrace with two others.
Yes. All three members of Vortex were there that day.
Who can you see?
Who can you see, Johnny?
Artem Karlenko.
Artem Karlenko, double agent.
Recruited by MI7 in Moscow.
Retired after his penchant for killing people threatened his cover.
Five years ago, he turned up here as Sergei Pudovkin.
Rich, very rich.
A member of the exclusive Oakwood Golf Club, which is where you'll be meeting him.
He's in a match play competition, sir.
I'm making you his opponent for the day.
Thank you, Tucker.
If Karlenko is Vortex, I want you to bring him in. Alive.
Mr Pussykin?
Pudovkin. And you must be Mr
Um...
Adams.
Beautiful car, Mr Adams.
Ah, the Royce.
Ready, sir.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Command accepted.
So, what line of business are you in, Mr Adams?
Pudovkin.
Sorry.
Yes, I'm Mr Adams, and you're Mr...
Whoever you said you were
- Well...
- Stop!
Sorry, I thought I had forgotten something.
Glove, sir'?
I may not know much about golf, Tucker, but I know how to hold the bat.
Shot, sir.
So, what line of business are you in, Mr Puddykin?
I made my money in the removals business.
Titus Fisher. You haven't come across him at all?
I warn you, Mr Adams, not to stray into the rough.
You get in there, you might never come out.
I'll bear that in mind, Mr Puddykin.
Pudovkin. Please. Shot!
As was my friend Fisher, actually.
In the back.
By his cleaner, of all people.
But they didn't take much.
Just a key
Break, left to right, I think.
Thank you.
Come on. - Oh, my God.
- He can't die.
He mustn't die.
Let's get him out of here.
Come on! Come on.
He's not looking good, sir.
We're getting you to a doctor. You'll be fine.
You do know how to fly these, sir?
- It was part of basic training.
- Good.
It's just like riding a bike.
Request guidance to nearest hospital. Where's your exact location?
Our location?
Location?
She shot out the navigation system. Hang on. - Runstock.
- Our location is Runstock.
What is your altitude?
What's our altitude?
About 18 inches.
Hello?
Hello?
Sorry. I'll just move.
What now, sir'?
We'll have to stick to the road. Let's follow the 1328.
There's bound to be a hospital in Dingham. Look after him, Tucker. Look after him.
- I think we're losing him, sir. - We can't lose him, Tucker.
♪ Don't give up on us, baby ♪
♪ Lord knows we've come this far ♪ ♪ We are The angel and the dreamer ♪
♪ Don'! give up on us, I know ♪ ♪ We could still come through ♪
Follow that ambulance! Good idea.
Sir. Sir, quickly.
Karlenko.
Karlenko!
The second key.
Vortex is KGB...
- Yes.
- CIA.
Yes?
Yes?
MI7.
Unbelievable.
A vole in MI7.
A mole, sir.
What?
There's a mole in MI7.
There's a mole and a vole?
No, sir.
There's a mole, not a vole.
Well, I disagree.
There's certainly a vole.
I mean, we know that much.
But what you're saying is there might be a mole as well. Pegasus.
There's a meeting at MI7 with the Prime Minister.
And here again, eyes down and to the left, indicating dissent.
With Xiang Ping, it's all about the eyes.
Thank you, Ms Sumner.
If the talks go ahead, I'd like you with us.
Yes, Prime Minister.
Good evening, gentlemen.
- Mr English.
- Ms Sumner.
Right.
So when is the Prime Minister going to grace us with his presence?
I'm the Prime Minister.
Yeah, you wish.
All right. So we're all here. These talks with China are of paramount importance.
Rogue slates in Southeast Asia have begun secretly to develop nuclear weapons.
It is vital that we get China onside.
Traditionally, China has been impervious to our concerns, but I believe Xiang Ping, given the opportunity, can and will help defuse this situation.
Well, with his pro-West stance, it certainly offers an opportunity, but the talks can't go ahead unless we can guarantee his safety.
I believe, with the correct security, that we can.
If Vortex is operational it's just too dangerous
I'm inclined to agree, Prime Minister.
There is a way.
The Swiss are willing to lend us Le Bastion.
That's their government fortress in the Alps.
It's a stunning example of architectural engineering at altitude, and completely impregnable.
I mean, that should solve all our security issues.
Then the talks go ahead.
Pamela, I hope you've brushed up on your Mandarin.
I'd like you in the room with me, and your best man on security.
Yes, Prime Minister.
Where are we on Vortex?
English?
Vortex is three men. Fisher was one, Karlenko was another.
Karlenko was killed today on the orders of the third.
Any leads?
Yes, but I need time.
We do not have time.
We need to know the identity of the third person in Vortex.
Give me 24 hours.
Another bottle of Romaine-Conti?
Of course.
And would you like to choose dessert?
Yes. You.
And bring two spoons. - Cheers.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
So, come on, Johnny, what was it you wanted to ask me'?
Simon, do you know what this is?
Some sort of key?
Karlenko and Fisher both had one, and they were both killed for them.
Well, I'll give it to the boys at the lab and see...
Karlenko told me that the third man in Vortex is in MI7.
And you believed him?
Simon, I have to ask you a question, face to face.
Do you have any idea who it might be?
Johnny, I thought you were about to accuse me.
No! I mean, honestly.
- What? - Simon Ambrose, the evil mastermind!
- Don't. Stop it-
- The traitor in our midst!
You!
You!
Simon, you are so funny. Hysterical. Oh, dear.
Would you excuse me for one moment, Simon?
- Sir.
- Tucker, can'! this wait?
Sir, it's Ambrose.
Yes, I know it's Ambrose.
I'm having dinner with him.
No, he's the third man in Vortex.
Simon Ambrose?
He went to Eton. Simon.
Leave it.
- What are you...
- Move. - All right, all right.
- Come on, move.
Tucker.
- You said you never knew Karlenko.
- That's right.
Then how do you explain these?
I hacked into Karlenko's computer.
You and him in Mozambique?
Sometimes I have trouble myself, old boy.
You're Vortex!
You're the third man in Vortex!
Tucker, this is ridiculous. Sorry, I'll be with you in just a tick.
It's true, I was in Mozambique.
What?
I was there because of Patch Quartermain.
Patch?
Sorry, I'll just be one second.
He's the man you're after.
- You're bluffing!
- Sorry.
I work for a secret organisation inside MI7 set up specifically to bring him in.
A secret Secret Service?
Yeah?
What's it called?
What's it called?
Armitage.
A secret secret secret service called Armitage?
We answer only to the PM.
It's extraordinary, Simon...
Indeed, it is.
...That you'd think for one moment that I would fall for such a steaming pile of old baloney.
Well done, Tucker.
You're not Spy of the Month for nothing.
- Thank you, sir.
- Here, let me take that.
Now go home.
- What?
- You're the one talking baloney.
You're in way over your head, boy.
Now run along.
No! I won't go, sir.
He's lying.
You've let me down, you've let the Service down and, frankly, I think you've let yourself down.
- But I...
- Now get out!
Patch Quartermain, of all people. Blowing his own legs off?
Now that's what I call deep cover.
And to think how much I admired him.
He hates you.
- Really?
- He always has.
He thinks you're a moron with no place in MI7, a jumped-up grammar school nobody That's why he tried to destroy you.
Now, Johnny, just because he ruined your life, that's no reason for you to go rogue and take him down on your own.
God forbid I should put a crazy idea like that in your head.
Good night, Simon.
Johnny, that key you showed me.
We might need it to bring him in.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.
Silly tit.
Bingo.
- Arrange a meeting with our client
- Of course.
Pegasus.
We have the third man.
It's Johnny English.
Hello, Patch.
Looking for forgiveness?
It's all over for you now, English.
It's the end of the line.
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Patch?
After all, I'm just a jumped-up grammar school nobody, aren't I?
What are you talking about?
I know that you are the third man in Vortex.
No, Johnny.
You are.
No, you are.
No.
You are!
Standby, all agents.
And it all ends here.
Take him. Johnny. Hey!
Got him!
Move!
Move!
Don't lose him.
Go, go!
Halt!
Idiot!
You've lost him!
I don't believe it.
Oi!
Pullover!
Stop ii!
Get after him.
You must believe me.
How will it be done?
Same as in Mozambique.
One person, apparently working alone.
Who have you chosen?
Leave that with me.
My account in Zurich.
500 million US dollars, as agreed.
You've been out for hours Well, you're lucky it was just a flesh wound.
Now, look, I'm going to Switzerland tonight, but you can stay here while I'm gone.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. I've been going through the news footage from the night Chambal was killed.
And there's something not right.
Seconds after President Chambal was shot, the assassin collapses and dies.
And the autopsy says heart failure.
But, if you go through the classified CCTV footage...
You all right?
Yeah, fine.
Take a look at this.
Fifteen minutes before the assassination, look, he's manic.
He's completely lost control of his body
And then, suddenly, catatonic.
Here, wait.
There.
Someone was talking to him.
I don't think he had any idea what he was doing.
I think Vortex's secret weapon...
Is a mind control drug.
And only one fits the symptoms.
Timox...
Timoxylin Bubby...
Timoxeline Barbebutenol.
The CIA ordered its destruction 10 years ago.
And the agent in charge of its disposal...
Titus Fisher.
I don't know how to thank you.
I'd love a take-away.
Consider it done.
Flying low.
So, Johnny, what are you going to do about Vortex'?
I don't know.
If only Simon was here. He'd know what to do.
Why do you think he's better than you?
Well, the man's a god.
Well, I prefer mortals.
Pure, complicated, maddening mortals.
I've come to realise that what's really exciting to me is great loyalty, determination, and courage.
You have always fascinated me, clinically.
But now you...
Ms Sumner, your pupils are dilating.
Are they?
Your cheeks are colouring.
Eye contact deepening.
Heart-rate rising.
Ms Sumner, I believe we're emotionally leaking. - The bedroom, quickly.
- Absolutely.
Now!
- Hello?
- Hello.
- Oh, Simon.
- Hi, Kate.
You ready?
I'll drive you to the airport.
How nice.
I'll just get my bag.
You alone?
No. Of course.
Been working?
Been brushing up on the Chinese PM. You?
We're trying to track clown Johnny English
There's some questions we want to ask him, about Vortex.
I don't suppose you've seen him, have you?
No.
Not hiding him away?
Not my type. Shall we? Mmm-hmm.
- Hello, Tucker.
- What are you doing here?
Every agent in the country is after you.
We were right about Ambrose
What do you mean "we"?
And if we can act fast, we can still...
You wouldn't listen, would you?
You think you know it all. Well' you don't!
Being an agent means everything to me.
And, thanks to you, I'm suspended!
Would you boys like some orange squash?
- No, thank you.
- Bye, thanks, Mum.
Tucker, Ambrose is in Switzerland.
We are in Tooting.
I am here because my country needs me.
And because it needs you, too.
- Royce.
- Ready, sir.
Come.
Obstruction detected. Set the sat nav for Switzerland Let's kick some bottom.
You have arrived at your destination.
Good luck, sir!
Le Bastion.
One way up, one way down.
Come on. Let's get the stuff.
Whoa, look.
The T-2 ground-to-air missile!
That's a D-7 bulletproof shield.
Take it from me, Tucker.
I was working with these while you were stringing conkers. The P-8 grapple hook?
Check.
- Estimated height?
- Thirty-five feet.
All yours, Tucker.
Can I just say, sir'?
This is just great.
Well, go on.
The D-16 ascender, and up we go.
Are you sure that's the ascender, sir?
Yes, yes, I'd know it anywhere.
Agent in distress.
Agent in distress. Agent in distress.
I am over here!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I am over here! Activating visual locator.
Three, two, one.
Intruders in Sector Four! Dear God, let me not die at the hands of the Swiss.
Tucker, now listen.
I want you to attack me
- What?
- After a struggle, you can "arrest me" and take me inside as your prisoner.
- Sir, I can't.
- Tucker, that's an order.
Hit me.
Hit me.
Come on, harder.
- Better, sh'?
- Yes, much better.
I can see how people get a taste for this.
I got a better idea. I'll shoot you!
No, no, no.
- Die, Vortex scum!
It's Johnny English.
Bag him.
The glass can withstand mortar attack.
The door's one-way.
You can get out, but no one gets in.
Excellent.
You ready, Slater'?
I'll have them send refreshments to your room when you're ready, Pegasus.
Thank you, Agent One.
I'll take it from here, boys.
Hold it right there!
Let me see your ID.
- Excuse me
- What the...
Stop!
Warning, this is a designated conflict zone. Sir'?
Sir?
- Thank you so much - You're welcome, Pegasus.
Pegasus.
Go on. Go on. What the hell is that?
Sir'?
Sir?
- English!
- Pegasus.
They're going to make you kill Xiang Ping!
You're insane!
Agent One, thank God.
He won't help you. He's the third member of Vortex.
Aren't you, Simon?
Here to give you some Timoxy bubby...
Timoxy bubby
Timoxy bubby...
To give you a drug that will make you obey his every command.
I'm intrigued, Simon.
How exactly were you going to administer it?
By injection?
Some hideous gas through the air vents?
Or by spiking her drink?
Timoxeline Barbebutenol.
He'll enter the manic phase any moment now.
I have to warn you that I've been trained to resist this kind of thing. You swine.
Agent One, what's going on?
He's quite harmless at this phase.
The drug will kill him, but just before it does, there'll be a short window where he'll do everything I tell him to.
Poor Johnny.
You were never really Ml-7, Johnny.
You were never really one of us.
Now you're about to become our most famous agent.
You'll now do exactly as I tell you.
You are a traitor to the Service and to your country.
Shut her up, old chap.
- Duck.
- What?
I warned you.
Okay, Slater.
Let's get him ready.
Ready.
Premier Ping, it's a pleasure to finally meet you.
You had a pleasant flight, I trust?
I was just asking the Premier if he had a pleasant flight.
Kate, Johnny's back on the team.
What?
It's all checked out and the PM and the Chinese have approved it.
- Approved what?
- He's standing in for Pamela.
Isn't it great?
Excuse me. Agent Tucker.
Good, good. And your wife is well? Lock it up, Johnny.
Wonderful.
That's it.
Premier, I am most grateful you have agreed to meet me at this time. It is our pleasure.
Maintain that tone, Prime Minister.
Avoid confrontation, keep eye contact.
I can assure you that the Chinese people have always regarded the British people as completely horrible.
- Honourable.
- Honourable.
Completely honourable.
Of course.
I was very keen to meet... Johnny, stand up and go to the water table.
Premier, I believe the present danger can be averted if we act swiftly.
Go to your right pocket.
We designed it for Pegasus.
Well, it's too bloody late now.
Just act natural. - Prime Minister, traditionally...
- Somethings wrong.
...China does not respond well to advice...
Pull out the barrel.
Now, Johnny, I want you to kill Xiang Ping.
Oh, dear God, no.
He's being controlled.
By who?
Ambrose.
Shoot Xiang Ping!
Mind must be master of the body.
He's resisting it.
His left hand is fighting the right hand.
Come on, Johnny.
If I can interrupt the frequency,
I could stop Ambrose from communicating with him. English, stand up!
Come on.
Come on.
He'll be dead in 50 seconds, sir.
Tucker!
Come on.
- Pull the trigger!
Listen to me, this is Simon Ambrose, and I order you to shoot Xiang Ping!
Ten seconds, sir.
Fire! Go, go, go. Time to get out of here.
Hold your fire!
Stand down! His pulse is dropping.
Don't lose him!
Come on, sir.
Open your head, English, and you shall be reborn.
Almost there.
Thank you, Kate.
I was passing.
Sir.
Tucker!
Welcome back, sir.
Thank you, Tucker.
I won't kiss you, if you don't mind.
Well, whatever.
Where's Ambrose?
English?
Sir. What are you doing, sir'?
Guideline 17-5: Never question a senior agent in the field.
No!
Ambrose' you five-star turd. Another balls-up, Johnny.
Ooh.
What's the matter with you? It's all over, Ambrose.
You can betray your country, you can cheat your friends, but you can't get away from Johnny English...
The bulletproof shield!
Hey!
It's not working!
It's the T-2, sir!
- Is he...
Oh, he's alive!
- It's the T-2!
Close it. Close ii!
Stupid thing!
Oh, Johnny.
The T-2.
Tucker, you clever boy.
I couldn't be more delighted.
Vortex's paymasters have been arrested, and China has expressed its gratitude to both Britain and the Service.
We owe English a great deal.
Well, reinstating his knighthood is a truly lovely gesture.
And it will mean the world to him.
Her Majesty will be with him shortly. Gotcha! Gotcha.
Got you!
Just about had enough of you, you old cow!
You're going nowhere!
Pegasus!
English!
It's her! It's the killer cleaner!
Finally, I've got her!
You never know when it's over, do you?
Well, it's over, over, over, over, over!
I don't have time.
I don't have time to worry about how it happened.
It is what it is.
We're genetically engineered to stop aging at 25.
The trouble is, we live only one more year unless we can get more time.
Time is now the currency.
We earn it and spend it.
The rich can live forever.
And the rest of us?
Hey, Mom.
You got in late last night.
I put in some overtime.
Where'd it go?
On you.
They drink it in New Greenwich. Happy 50th!
Fifty?
That's right.
Twenty-five for the 25th time.
Oh, I was sure I'd have a grandchild by now.
Here we go.
Bela's daughter is always asking about you.
Who has time for a girlfriend?
Besides, what's the hurry?
What do you got?
Three days. Not even.
We owe half that in rent.
Eight for the electric and we're still late on that loan.
I can make extra on the side, you know.
- I could--
- What, start fighting?
Nobody wins.
Yeah.
Remember, I'm not here tonight.
I got two days' work in the garment district.
- I know.
- Meet me at the bus stop tomorrow.
- After I pay off the loan, I won't have long. - I'll be there. Will...
I just wouldn't know what to do if I lost you.
I'm late.
Let me give you 30 minutes so you can have a decent lunch.
I love you.
Happy birthday, Mom.
When you get back, we're going to celebrate.
Will!
Will!
You got a minute?
What are you talking about, Mya?
You have a whole year.
Not a year I can use yet.
Come on, Will. I've got bills to pay.
Here, take five minutes.
Get out of here.
Four minutes for a cup of coffee?
Yesterday, it was three.
You want coffee or you want to reminisce?
Two coffees.
- How many shifts you got today, Borel? - Just the two.
Really excited about it.
If you had any of your father in you, we could make a fortune.
I don't fight.
There's another one. Broad daylight.
Whoa, what is this?
Where's the rest?
Never met the quota.
My units are up from last week.
So's the quota. Next.
That's a joke, right?
- Next. - Move it.
You're taking forever.
You in, Will?
I don't have time to gamble anymore.
Oh, thank God.
Because ever since you stopped playing, I started winning.
You still owe me an hour.
You seen Borel?
- Will!
- Hey, man.
Your wife's looking for you.
You're not gonna believe it.
This madman's been buying drinks all night.
He's got a century!
Come on, let me get you home.
Soon as I finish this drink.
Hey!
You!
You!
More everything!
Do you want to come home with me?
You can take us both home.
Excuse me.
You need to get out of here.
Somebody's gonna clean that clock.
Yes!
I mean, they aren't going to rob you. They are going to kill you.
They can't take that much time and let you live to tell about it. Yes.
I don't think you understand. You should not be here!
Will.
Will!
Minutemen!
Minutemen!
Walk away, Will.
Those gangsters aren't playing around.
Wait, wait.
He's asking for it. Let's go.
He's not one of us.
You think he'd help us?
Don't worry. I won't do anything stupid.
Go.
The name's Fortis.
And that, sir, is a very nice watch.
Do you mind if I try it on? I think it would suit me.
I'll tell you what.
I'll fight you for it.
Come on.
I'm an old man. Turned 75 last week.
I need a moment.
You ready to go?
Ready to go.
Let's get you out of here.
Get him!
Stop. What are you doing?
I can take care of myself.
Yeah, it looked like it.
I know what I'm doing.
Run.
Run!
Come on!
Here!
Hurry!
Move!
Where the hell are you going?
Get in here!
I know who took him.
I know who he is.
Who he was.
Damn it, damn it.
What the hell are you doing here?
Flashing all that?
You out of your mind?
Henry Hamilton.
Will Salas.
Ugh.
God.
Drink more, it gets better.
Not much better.
You'll be safe till morning.
I'll get you out of here.
You're from New Greenwich.
Does it show?
Nah.
Looks like you could use some help yourself.
No, thanks.
How old are you?
In real time?
Twenty-eight.
I'm 105.
Good for you.
You won't see 106, you have too many more nights like tonight.
You are right.
But the day comes when you've had enough.
Your mind can be spent, even if your body's not.
We want to die.
We need to.
That's your problem?
You've been alive too long?
You ever known anyone who's died?
For a few to be immortal, many must die.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You really don't know, do you?
Everyone can't live forever. Where would we put them?
Why do you think there are Time Zones?
Why do you think taxes and prices go up the same day in the ghetto?
The cost of living keeps rising to make sure people keep dying.
How else could there be men with a million years while most live day to day?
But the truth is there's more than enough.
No one has to die before their time.
If you had as much time as I have on that clock, what would you do with it?
I'd stop watching it.
I can tell you one thing.
If I had all that time,
I sure as hell wouldn't waste it.
Get some rest.
Don't worry. I won't take it in the night.
And I won't take yours.
It does get better.
- Oh, hey, Will.
- Hey, Greta.
Is Borel in?
Yeah. Borel?
Look at that.
A shame we gotta wait 25 years.
We could use that year right now.
Borel?
I'm here.
You'd better get her inside, Greta.
Look at this.
Where did you get that?
The guy at the bar.
They were going to kill him.
He gave it to me.
He timed himself out before I could stop him.
No one gives anybody 100 years.
He didn't just give me this.
He gave me the truth about it.
You can't let anyone see that.
Hey.
You know that time will get you killed.
How long have we been friends?
What, 10 years?
Here.
A decade.
You've been like a brother.
Where are you going?
Where this won't look out of place.
I finally got the time to take my mom to New Greenwich.
Greta, I'm going out!
Loan payment received, two days.
Thank you.
Dayton.
Two hours.
It's always been an hour.
Now it's two.
Price went up. Since when?
Since today.
My son is meeting me.
He'll pay the difference.
I can't do that, policy.
Please?
It's a two-hour walk.
I have an hour and a half.
Then you'd better run.
Stop! Please stop!
Wait! Please!
Please, no!
Wait!
No!
Please!
Mom?
Will!
Will!
- Will!
- Mom!
No, no, no, no!
No!
Mom, Mom, Mom!
Thirteen zeros.
Unlucky for all.
The last time anyone saw him alive, there was over a century on that clock.
Around here, they'd kill you for a week. What was he doing in this Time Zone?
What I was thinking was he might have brought this on himself.
Interesting.
How long you been keeping time, Jaeger? Five years.
Let me know what you think when you have been doing it for 50.
It doesn't matter why he came here.
What matters are the hundred years that came with him.
Gotta be a witness.
Trust me, no one saw anything.
What would you like us to do, sir?
What we always do.
Follow the time.
Hey, Ray.
I'll give you 10 minutes for an hour.
When are you gonna get out of the game, Leila?
You gotta be pushing 60.
Thanks for letting everyone know.
Am I in the right place?
We don't normally make pickups in this Zone.
I was lost.
Please deposit one month.
Please deposit two months.
There are more of these than I remember.
That was a year.
Welcome to New Greenwich.
What are you really doing here?
I'm going to take them for everything they've got.
I'm going to make them pay.
Please, miss. You can't be too careful.
Are you sure?
What's a night here cost?
Two months for a standard room.
Give me a suite.
Do you need help with your bags?
No.
- He's fast.
- He's going to have to be.
The camera doesn't show us how the body got into the river.
What do we really know?
What do we know?
We know that most thefts in Dayton amount to hours or days.
This was a century.
I don't see any more in circulation.
He could have capsuled the time.
You can't hide a hundred years in the ghetto.
They can sense when a man has a month more than he should. The time left town.
That'll be eight and a half weeks.
Take a week for yourself.
Thanks.
You're not from around here, are you?
You do everything a little too fast.
Not everything.
What's that place across the street?
The casino.
Can anybody go?
Not dressed like that.
Good luck.
Sir, you were right.
If you turn back the clocks the day of Hamilton's death, and look at the time checks, someone spent years crossing four different Time Zones from Dayton--
To New Greenwich.
The cameras picked up on his suspicious behavior.
He's conscious of the surveillance, he doesn't have a bodyguard, and he runs.
But if he has time, he doesn't need to run.
It's a hard habit to break.
You're looking for a match?
His name is Will Salas.
You know him?
No.
I remember his father.
Good evening.
I assume my time is as good as anyone's.
Indeed it is. However, there is a voluntary donation for non-members. Most give a year.
What's your game?
Poker.
Right this way.
What's the limit?
There is none.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure of your company before, Mr...
Salas.
Will Salas.
Philippe Weis.
You must come from time.
You could say I'm gambling my inheritance.
You don't have a guard, Mr. Salas?
I assumed I was amongst friends.
Bet you 50 years.
You must be young.
When you've been 25 for 85 years, like I have, knowing only a random act of violence can take your life, you learn to appreciate what you have.
And you seem to have a lot to appreciate.
I call.
Of course, some think what we have is unfair.
The time difference between Zones.
I've heard that.
But isn't this just the next logical step in our evolution?
And hasn't evolution always been unfair?
It's always been survival of the fittest.
Raise you another two centuries.
This is merely Darwinian capitalism. Natural selection.
Absolutely.
The strong survive.
And I think your hand is weak.
I call.
It appears you're all in, Mr. Salas.
Thirteen figures.
Well played.
That was some risk.
It wasn't a risk.
No offense. I knew I was going to win.
Confusing times.
Is she my mother, my sister or my daughter?
You're hoping she's not my wife.
Things used to be simpler once.
Very beautiful.
Daughter.
Though she does look a lot like my wife. Sylvia?
Will Salas.
Congratulations, Mr. Salas.
You've taken years off my father's life.
Which is normally what you do. Isn't that right, my darling?
We're having a party tomorrow night.
Perhaps you'll give him a chance to win back some of those years.
I'd love to.
Carl will tell you where I am.
Good night, Mr. Salas.
Sylvia, stay with your guards.
Fifty-nine years.
Plus tax.
The price includes delivery.
Delivery?
To wherever you're going to display it.
Display it?
Hell, I'm going to drive it.
Will Salas.
Allow me to introduce my mother-in-law, Clara, my wife, Michele, and my daughter, Sylvia.
I believe you two have already met. Nice to meet you all.
I'll come find you later for our game.
I look forward to it.
Having fun, Mr. Salas?
Please, call me Will.
It's okay, Constantin.
Do you always have a hired hand standing right next to you?
No. I usually have two.
That doesn't make it very easy to get to know you.
I think that's the idea.
Your idea?
My father's.
I understand.
You all have a lot to lose. So do you.
What do you do, Will?
I haven't quite figured that out yet.
Yes, why bother?
What's the hurry?
Right.
Why do today what you can do in a century?
I know one thing we can do.
Dance with me.
Do you really come from time?
Why would you doubt that?
I saw you run.
Reminds me of people who come from the ghetto.
Sometimes I envy them.
You don't know anything.
Oh, no?
The clock is good for no one.
The poor die and the rich don't live.
We can all live forever as long as we don't do anything foolish.
Doesn't that scare you?
That maybe you'll never do anything foolish?
Or courageous or anything worth a damn?
Come with me.
This was tonight.
He's only an hour ahead of us.
Look at that.
I've never seen anything like it.
What are you doing?
We don't go in.
You're insane.
You have this in your backyard. You never go in.
And I'm insane?
Well?
What are you waiting for?
Sylvia, come on!
What happened to doing something foolish?
I don't know you.
We could change that.
I get it.
You're out here, all alone, with a stranger.
You can't be too careful.
Maybe you can.
Sylvia!
Sylvia!
I have to go back.
To what?
You should go back.
- Have you seen my daughter?
She's with her guards.
Right behind you.
Thank God.
Now, how about that game?
It's all right, everyone.
What's this about?
I'm sorry to have to break up the party, Mr. Weis.
I just need a word with your friend. My friend?
Very well.
I'm Timekeeper Raymond Leon.
I'm Will Salas.
I know.
What are you doing in this Zone?
It's not illegal, is it? To change Time Zones?
No, it's not illegal.
It's just rare. Where did you get that?
I won it.
Gambling.
All of it?
No.
He said he didn't need it anymore.
He timed himself out.
Henry Hamilton was worth thousands of years.
He could practically live forever.
You expect me to believe that he was immortal and he wanted to die?
I don't expect you to believe it.
But it's the truth.
It was a gift.
I'm not a thief.
But, hey, if you guys are looking for stolen time, maybe you should arrest everyone here.
Oh, I see.
You're talking about justice.
Well, I am a Timekeeper.
I don't concern myself with "justice."
I only concern myself with what I can measure.
Seconds, minutes, hours.
I keep time.
And that time is in the wrong hands.
That time will be held, along with you.
We'll leave you two hours for booking and processing.
Why are you investigating a suicide?
There's mass murder in the ghetto every day.
That is fascinating.
Huh.
I heard another man talk like that.
It was over 20 years ago.
You're probably too young to remember your father.
We'll arrange safe transport.
This is New Greenwich, after all.
Sylvia? Do as I say and go with the guards.
Oh, for God's sake, Father. There's an army in this house.
If we can't stop one man from killing us, we should kill ourselves.
Stop him!
Move!
Get out of the way!
Put it down or I'll blow her head off.
Thanks.
You're going to kill us! Please just let me out!
What are you doing?
Do you even know how to drive?
What's there to know?
Oh, shit.
Give me some time.
I guess you really are from the ghetto, after all.
What the hell do you know about where I'm from?
Give me some time.
Or you're gonna kill me, like you killed Henry Hamilton?
Lend me an hour.
I'm not giving you a second. I should have listened to my father.
Please, take me home. Please.
- I can't do that.
You're keeping me alive.
Keep that covered.
Anybody sees it, you're definitely dead.
Now that worked too well.
You guys wasted a gorgeous car.
Look who it is.
Who it was.
He's done in minutes.
He'll wake up dead.
That'll be a shock.
Too bad. I would have preferred to kill him more beautifully.
The girl's still breathing.
She's got a decade.
Holy shit.
The man he stole from me had more than a century.
What?
We'll divide it later.
It's like an angel fell from the sky.
Fortis!
Leave it!
Fortis!
Look at me.
You okay?
No.
Why are you laughing?
We're not dead.
Yeah, we're not alive for long, either.
Where did my time go?
I have a half hour!
Ah.
You're lucky.
- Minutemen.
- Does everyone in the ghetto steal?
That's rich, coming from you.
- Please help me, Will.
- Let me guess, now you like the idea of sharing. Come here.
Hey, don't worry. It's not the first time I've been this broke.
Well, it's a first for me.
What are we going to do?
Whatever we have to.
Come on, we got to go.
Dispatch, wire me my per diem.
Time transfer.
Cutting it close again, sir.
Well, I'm still walking around.
Judging by the lack of dead bodies, I have to assume they are also.
They got jacked. They couldn't have left here with more than minutes.
He's back in his old neighborhood.
So, where do you want us to start looking?
We don't. He'll come to us.
Borel?
Borel, open up. It's Will.
Greta.
Where's Borel?
He's dead.
Dead?
What?
You gave him a decade.
He drank himself to death with nine years on his clock.
Jesus Christ.
Greta, I'm so sorry.
Goodbye, Will.
Will, we have minutes.
Try not to act like it.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Shut up! We're going to die, Will! Do you want to die?
Shut up!
I hope those are real.
Stop!
Wait! Please, wait!
Come back in an hour.
That won't be possible.
Here!
I'll give you two days for them.
They're diamonds.
You can take the 48 hours, or you can be a pretty corpse.
We'll take it.
Don't make a sound.
Give me my time.
Let's go.
I guess I got my wish.
I did do something foolish.
Your name's on a lot of buildings.
It's my father's name.
How much is he worth, anyway?
Eons.
What do you think he'd pay to get you back?
You have no shame, do you?
Please deposit one minute.
Dial.
Hello.
Mr. Weis, please give the phone to the Timekeeper.
Hello, Will. How much do you want?
A thousand years.
You'll never live to spend it.
Then distribute it to the Time Lines in Dayton.
Do it by sunrise tomorrow and she can go home.
Will...
I'm afraid for you, Will.
You keep talking like him, you're going to die like him.
My father died in a fight, trying to take a man's time.
Oh, no. His crime wasn't taking time.
He was doing something far more dangerous.
Please don't make your father's mistake.
Dayton.
Pedre Plaza.
I know it.
A thousand years to the Time Lines.
A thousand years.
It's nothing.
It's for our daughter.
No, it's for them.
This is insane.
They can take your time, just like that.
Or you can take theirs.
This is insane.
Yeah, it's insane.
We should be safe here until dawn.
I pay by the day.
It'll take them a while to find me.
This is your place?
There's water. It's cold, but it's something.
You can put on fresh clothes.
Where's your family?
My mother timed out.
This is her dress. Yeah.
What about your father?
He died when I was a boy.
He was a fighter. Strong arm.
He wasn't the strongest, but he knew how to win.
How do you win?
I'll show you.
What you do is let them have the upper hand.
Then, he'd let his time go all the way down.
Because he knew that when you were down to your last seconds and they think it's over,
they start watching your clock
and forget to watch their own.
He died in a fight?
I think he was killed for giving away what he won.
He wasn't just giving them time.
He was giving them hope. How long have you been this old?
Twenty-five for three.
Twenty-five for two.
What was it like when your clock started?
I was in the street.
It almost knocked me over.
My year was gone in a week, we were so in debt.
After that, I lived day to day.
Mine was a little different.
It woke me.
I looked in the mirror.
I guess everybody does.
That's what you're gonna look like for the rest of your life.
My dad gave me a decade to celebrate.
You must hate me.
Where I come from.
It's nobody's fault, what they're born with.
They open in a minute.
Let's see how generous your father is now.
The Timekeepers would have never let him do it. You don't have to say that.
How do you think my father built all those buildings?
By giving away a thousand years?
Now what?
You can go home.
There's people on the streets.
I can move without being spotted.
What have you got?
Eleven hours.
How does anyone live like this?
You don't generally sleep in.
You can call for help.
I'll watch from here, I'll make sure you're safe.
You know, you could fight this.
I can say that running to the ghetto was my idea.
My father'd believe that, he thinks I'm reckless.
He has a lot of influence, Will.
He can get you a lawyer.
He can make a deal with those Timekeepers.
I'm pretty sure that Timekeeper doesn't make deals.
What are you going to do?
Steal?
Is it stealing if it's already stolen?
Here. Just in case.
I'll be right here.
Please deposit one minute.
- Father?
- Sylvia? You couldn't spare a second, Father?
I wish I could say I'm surprised.
Did you hear what I just said?
You know I'd do anything for you.
They're coming to get you.
They know where you are.
Will, look out!
Sorry to disappoint you, we don't keep much on us.
To discourage thieves like you.
Think of this as a gift. Will!
Come on!
I didn't mean to shoot him.
I wanted to scare him.
I think you did both.
You could say thank you.
Thank you. What have you got?
Nine hours.
Why did you give him time?
You should have taken it.
Timekeepers live day to day.
It'll be hours before the others show up.
He could die in the ghetto.
He still might.
Timekeeper, what's the hurry?
Stay a while. You might like us if you got to know us!
They're going to think you're with me.
Yes.
This is a mess.
Welcome to my world.
Back off!
You've been shot. I was worried you timed out.
Where'd you get that?
What are we going to do?
We can't keep driving around in this car.
It's a cop car.
So let's make an arrest.
Was I going too fast?
Not fast enough.
The mistake you made was stopping.
Now, let's see who you got back there.
Got to be a year or two nobody's using.
Whoa!
It went off.
I was just trying to help.
Come on.
Now, I'd say, "Your money or your life," but since your money is your life...
How dare you steal from me?
- Don't think of it as stealing.
- No? Think of it as repossession.
I'll leave you with what I've had most every day of my life.
- One day.
Are you insane?
You can do a lot in a day.
Those are pretty.
I owe you these.
You shouldn't have.
You, out.
Will Salas, prime suspect in the murder of Henry Hamilton, is believed to be traveling with Sylvia Weis, daughter of finance magnate, Philippe Weis.
Citizens are advised to exercise extreme--
We look cute together.
It doesn't say you're wanted.
It doesn't say I'm not.
You've forgotten I shot a cop.
I admit, not very well.
It was your first time.
Hey.
I can say I made you do all of it.
You can go back.
Go back to what?
Do I really want to spend my whole life trying not to die by mistake?
A lot of people would say being here is a mistake.
I don't have a choice.
I'm starting to think that I don't, either.
I want to reassure you all there is no cause for alarm.
No ransom was paid.
Your Zone is at risk, Philippe.
It puts us at risk. It can spread.
Too much time in the wrong hands can crash the market.
This hostage situation will be quickly resolved.
Sir.
Everything is under control.
Timekeeper. After this regrettable incident, it's really not necessary for you to come in person.
I'm afraid it really is necessary.
When can we hope for a rescue?
I believe that's the point.
She doesn't appear to want to be rescued.
Mr. Leon.
Raymond.
May I call you Raymond?
I blame myself.
I invited the man into my home.
He had so much time, how was I supposed to know?
Of course, Sylvia brought this on herself by her lack of vigilance.
That's why I always tried to keep her close.
But she is clearly under Will Salas' control.
If it's a matter of resources,
I'm happy to make a contribution.
It's a scandal, what we pay our Timekeepers.
I've issued a warrant for your daughter's arrest.
If she contacts you and you assist her in any way, I will issue a warrant for your arrest.
There is nothing I cannot buy.
Now... how many of my years do you want?
There aren't enough years, even in your lifetime, Mr. Weis.
This is called a trigger.
And you don't pull it until you actually want to shoot something.
I wanted to shoot something. Right.
Will, if you get a lot of time, are you really gonna give it away?
I've only ever had a day.
How much do you need?
How can you live with yourself watching people die right next to you?
You don't watch.
You close your eyes.
I can help you get all the time you want.
I need to borrow a month.
What's the interest?
Today's rate, 30%.
I can't pay it back.
We can always come to some arrangement.
Let's go.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to announce that Weis Timelenders is now offering interest-free loans with no payments.
Ever.
So help yourselves and take a day.
Take a month.
Hell, take a year. Come on. Help yourselves!
Take it. Take the time.
No one's watching their clocks, huh?
Get out of here, or I'll confiscate every second!
Must've thought it was a drive-through.
Turn around.
Don't move.
I don't have much.
Everything I have, I give away.
I know.
Yes, sir, I do know that, sir.
There are years that shouldn't be there.
I will stop him, sir.
Doesn't he understand he's hurting the very people he's trying to help?
Well, now.
- Look at all that.
I finally had time to buy one of these. Let's not do anything I might regret.
What was that about?
I wasted 30 days.
Today, Sylvia Weis withdrew some of her "inheritance"
when she and Will Salas robbed her father's time bank for the sixth time in a week.
I give her everything.
Does she want to kill me?
You were killing her, Philippe.
You were suffocating her.
You suffocate us all.
Call.
That's good.
Just not as good as that.
Ooh!
You haven't forgotten how to play cards.
Why did I play strip poker with you?
Why did you?
Sir.
They're still there.
How did you know, sir?
This is where the hours and the days are. He's paid them all off.
This is where I would hide.
Put your clothes on.
Stop!
- We're trapped!
Jump. They won't do it.
We shouldn't do it.
Come on!
See?
They won't jump.
So much for your theory. Shit!
Here!
Go!
Stop!
Stop!
I'm telling you, he'll give up before we do!
You sure about that?
No.
- Go.
- I can't.
You can!
Un-fucking-believable!
Hold on.
You two look familiar.
How about now?
Welcome to the Century.
Hi. We're looking for a quiet place to stay.
How many rooms?
All of them.
We were hoping for something long-term.
Can we rely on the discretion of your staff?
I'm sure you can.
I'm sorry. We're fully booked.
Right.
Nobody goes anywhere!
Wait, whoa, whoa.
Don't look at me.
You know who I'm looking for.
I'm looking for whoever gave this man a month!
And I'm gonna clean the clocks off of every one of you in this hellhole until someone says something I want to hear.
I can't hear anything.
Clean it.
No, wait, wait.
Wait.
Please don't.
Please. I don't know where they are!
Please.
Please!
Please.
I believe you're next.
Um...
At last, someone's acting reasonably.
I just want a share of the reward.
My young friend.
You'll get your reward.
Ten years.
That's insulting.
If they catch us, there's no way they won't kill us, is there?
Do you regret this?
You saved my life.
When?
Now.
And every day since I met you.
You forget, I almost got you killed a few times, too.
I'm willing to overlook that.
How's the poor little rich girl?
I never got a chance to... properly thank you for your time.
I'm not surprised you stayed.
It's the life, isn't it?
Here we don't stop living until we're actually dead.
There are a lot more ways to die around here.
But here, there's dancing before dying.
Of course, it's your friend I'm most happy to run into again.
You've been causing a lot of trouble, which is normally my job.
Don't you understand?
The reason the Timekeepers leave me alone is 'cause I have boundaries.
I steal from my own people.
You surely know things are bad when I have to restore order.
Fortunately for you, I don't like to kill a man in cold blood.
I do it, but I prefer not to.
I think you deserve a fighting chance.
We play to zero.
What's the point?
I lose, I die.
I win, they kill me.
If you don't fight, I'll kill you now.
And her?
After I take you,
I'll take her.
Oh, yeah. And her time.
Then I'll collect my reward for making everything right in the world.
This way!
All the time he's taken.
Don't you mean the time he's given away, sir?
Even to you?
I have given 50 years of my life to this job.
I am not about to see those years go to waste.
Go on.
I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you, but by tomorrow... you won't have time to stand around.
God damn it.
It's over.
We lost. We're not doing any good.
At least we're trying.
No. You don't understand. All they have to do is keep raising the cost of living.
A hundred years. Two. A thousand.
It does nothing. So, what? We just stop fighting?
We can't win. We can't hurt them.
The time we're taking makes no damn difference!
What would? What would hurt them?
A million years.
You got a million years on you?
I guess it really would take a million years.
Let's give up.
Stop!
I am Sylvia Weis.
I want to surrender, but only to my father.
Sylvia.
Hello, Daddy.
Stay where you are!
You've hired more guards since I last saw you.
Thanks to you, I need them.
Guns down.
Now!
Do it.
Let's go for a ride.
You'd steal from your own father.
Is it stealing if it's already stolen?
What's the combination?
Well, it's not my birthday.
You've started to regret that day, I imagine, Father.
Try 12-2-18-09.
Darwin's birthday.
Survival of the fittest.
It cost us centuries just to bribe our way in here.
Let's see what it got us.
Quality time.
There really is a man with a million years.
That's my first million. It won't be my last.
You know how much good it could do?
I know how much harm it could do.
Try to understand, even if you gave a year to a million people, you're just prolonging their agony.
You're prolonging their lives.
Flooding the wrong Zone with a million years, it could cripple the system.
Let's hope so.
We're not meant to live like this. We're not meant to live forever.
Although I do wonder, Father, if you've ever lived a day in your life.
Is that so?
You might upset the balance for a generation.
Two.
But don't fool yourself. In the end, nothing will change.
Because everyone wants to live forever.
They all think they have a chance at immortality even though all the evidence is against it.
They all think they will be the exception.
But the truth is, for a few to be immortal, many must die.
No one should be immortal if even one person has to die.
What was that?
What was that?
What just happened?
It must be a mistake.
A million years just went off the clock in New Greenwich.
It's not a mistake.
It's gotta be a mistake, sir.
It's not a mistake.
It's them.
Take a month, Maurice.
Dispatch, what can you see?
There's a lot of traffic in the vicinity, sir.
All right, look for the slowest car.
You have a million years.
You are definitely not in a hurry.
If this works...
If this works, we gotta get more.
Dayton's not the only zone that can use a few extra years.
And wire me my per diem.
Wait. Never mind. I have him.
Give the order, shoot on sight.
In New Greenwich? That's against policy, sir.
So is having a million years leave the Zone.
That time cannot leave the Zone! Shoot on sight!
Please deposit one month.
Please deposit one month.
Keep going!
Keep going!
We're close! We're okay! We're okay!
You're late.
Need a minute?
Go.
Where's our capsule?
Too late.
Lost a lot of time, Mr. Leon.
Looks like you're about out yourself.
- Time!
- There's time!
Move!
You, get out!
We gotta get to Livingston.
We can make it.
Can we?
You okay?
Stop!
You can run.
So can you.
You're from here, aren't you?
Long time ago.
Yeah.
I worked out how to escape.
And now you make sure no one else does.
That's the way it has to be.
I didn't start the clock.
I can't turn it back.
I keep it running.
I keep time.
"I keep time."
I'm gonna need some of that time you borrowed from me.
Unless you want us to die on the way to our execution.
Time.
We don't have enough.
One of us can make it.
Take mine. You take mine. You can get there, I can't!
I can't get there.
You can.
- No.
No.
Please.
No.
There's time.
- What? - The Keeper's time.
Run.
Run!
I need time.
Time transfer.
What have we got?
A day.
Could do a lot in a day.
Sir, do something.
It's already done.
These are live pictures from Dayton.
Citizens have taken to the streets.
There's so much stolen time in circulation.
Factories in Dayton lie idle.
And now, citizens are crossing Zones, seen here entering New Greenwich.
While authorities claim they have the situation under control, others fear the system may be headed for collapse.
We will continue to update you on this developing story.
Sir, we lost Zone Eight. And Ten.
It's spreading.
What do we do, sir?
Go home.
Still no sign of fugitives Will Salas and Sylvia Weis.
Authorities continue to ask for the public's help in bringing these criminals to justice.
Told you there were bigger banks.
You almost missed your calling.
Master, where did this blizzard come from?
Don't believe everything you see!
But I really feel cold!
Then you're already under her spell
I've lost without fighting?
The ice harpy!
Wait!
You're no match for her
Now you tell me!
You have come so far to find me
Are you not entranced by my charms?
Instead of meditating on your sins you are still harming humans!
Blame those men, not me!
I was so good to each one of them
But their roving eyes strayed away from me
So they deserved it!
You're an enchantress, they were humans
You were never meant to be together
Today I'll bring it to an end I\/Ionk, you think you can escape from my spell?
Then come and get me!
Master, have you killed her?
I've trapped her
Confine her in the Lei Feng Pagoda
Me again?
It's me!
"Jin Shan Temple"
"Lei Feng Pagoda"
Trying to scare me?
Master wouldn't have trapped you if you were really scary
We're giving you another chance
A chance to reflect and improve if you make real progress in meditation you'll be released
You, too!
Study to improve yourself!
Hey!
Hurry up back there!
Coming!
Xu Xian...
I shouldn't have climbed up here to pick herbs with you
Be a bit more patient
Look!
Here's one!
Unlike Shennong, you know the value of herbs
Xu Xian, you even know which flowers to eat
Which flowers cure which ailments
Do you even know what flower that is?
That fool is eating flowers!
They have thorns!
He's no fool
He's not picking the pretty wild roses with their thorns
Roses are pretty...
But not as pretty as me
You... you're more like a hornflower
Blowing your own horn from dawn to dusk
Hey, don't you even know...
Medicines cure some ailments
But others need liquor distilled from flowers!
That's absolutely right!
Let's keep going
- Alright
- Climb further?
Look, they're still digging for herbs
They'll strip the whole mountain bare!
I'll give them a scare!
What?
Qingqing...
Xu Xian?
Xu Xian?
He's coming to
Xu Xian, are you alright?
Xu Xian!
Xu Xian!
Where's that girl?
What girl?
Maybe you banged your head too hard...
Just now, in the water, a girl kissed me
She breathed into my mouth
She saved me
Hey!
The one giving you the kiss of life was me!
Why did you save him?
You even gave his vital energy a boost!
Hey, I'm talking to you!
What are you staring at?
Nothing
Nothing?
You're smitten!
Master, it looks like another bat-demon bite
Amitabha...
Today is the 15th...
The day of the Lantern Festival
We have to find these demons soon
Or many more people will die
Amitabha...
Ferryman, wait!
Here!
We need to cross the river, ferryman
I'm no ferryman, but jump in
I hope we're not delaying you
Not at all!
To help others is to spend time well
Thank you, kind sir
Sir...
What you just said was very interesting
How do you use your time when you're not helping others?
I'm aiming to become a doctor of medicine
Good, good!
Young men like us should have dreams!
I have one too
I dream of become the Abbot of Jinshan Temple
And where would that leave me?
Uh, Master... that's not...
I didn't mean now...
I mean, after...
After my death?
You want me to die?
No, I...
I...
That's not what I meant, Master...
I...
It seems you are Abbot Fahai of Jinshan Temple
It takes ten years of good deeds for two people to meet it's destiny that let us to be acquainted
Young man, you're from Hangzhou?
Yes, my name's Xu Xian
I'm a herbalist
Master, what are you counting?
How long until I die
Xu Xian, the weather's nice today!
That it is
Don't change the subject
What was your dream again?
No...
The ultimate dream
I don't have any dream!
My only dream is my wish that you...
White, tell us what's bothering you
Turtle and I can help you resolve it
What... do... you...
I want to visit the human world
You just want to see that flower-eating fool!
I'd just like to take another look at him
Look at what?
He's just a common mortal!
You've been moping over him for days!
What's this all about?
She used her vital essence to save a fool who was drowning if... your...
lips...
Let me say it if their lips met there was a flow of vital essences
He's in you and you're in him!
Nothing so serious, I just want to take a look at him
Don't give me a hard time
Qingqing, come with me!
Hey, where are you going?
I want to come!
Take me too!
I will just stay here
See how much fun the mortal world is?
In a moment, get off the boat and find him for me
I'll be strolling around here
When you find him, bring him to the pavilion on the lake
Why don't you find him yourself?
I want to play a little joke on him
And see how nice he is
Master, it's turning!
Then don't blow on it!
We'll split up to look around
Ah!
Watch out!
What is it?
A demon!
A demon?
How do you know?
I'm an expert, of course I know
Are you going to exorcise it?
Shh, not so loud!
it's nearby!
My Master and I have been tracking it for ages
Master says we must exorcise it today
Why do you have to do that?
Demons hurt people
What about demons which don't hurt people?
I don't know
Could you make friends with them?
Definitely not!
Why not?
Master only taught me how to exorcise them
Not how to make friends with them then your Master has a problem
Or maybe his Master had a problem
Why don't I have a problem?
Because you absolutely don't have one
You're very nice
And very smart
I'd like to have a friend like you
I'm Qingqing
I'm Neng Ren
I'm busy, I have to go
Take care!
You are the gentleman my sister wants to see
Look again, do I look like a gentleman?
You have the wrong man
Can't be...
You're a herb-picker, aren't you?
Yes, but I'm not a gentleman
So I can't possibly be the one your sister wants to see
I recognize you, you're the man who eats flowers then what's my name?
Who am I?
I don't know
But you are the one my sister wants to see
It's Lantern Festival night, go and enjoy it
And stop bothering me
Goodnight... young miss
What on earth?
Why's it moving?
Stop!
You're a real fool
Where do you think you're going?
Sorry!
Sorry!
I didn't do that on purpose!
Sit down
Miss, it's late and you're here alone
This isn't proper
Don't treat me as a stranger
You don't need to be so polite
No, no, I should go
Who built this pavilion?
it's so rickety
Well, I think it's very nice
And it's a perfect spot to see the West Lake
I'm afraid I'm not so interested
And I need to get home
This early?
There's moonlight on the lake, a pavilion in the moonlight...
And we're in the pavilion
Don't you think it's romantic?
I'm too busy for romance
What are you avoiding?
Why are you keeping such a distance from me?
Why don't you like me?
It's not that I don't like you, Miss
But someone else already has my heart
Miss, I'm a very poor man
I pick herbs for a living
I'm not worthy of your affections then tell me about her
What kind of person is she?
I know almost nothing about her
I can't even recall her face
All I know is that she saved my life
That day I fell into a lake in the mountains
She rescued me
if she saved your life, you owe her a lot
But when I revived she was gone
My friends said I'd imagined her
But I'm quite sure she was real
Because she kissed me so deeply
That kiss saved my life
In a way, it also took my life
What if...
You could kiss her again?
Would you remember her this time?
Hello, my friend!
Oh, it's you... haven't gone home yet?
Done with your errands?
All done
It's dangerous here, you should go home if it's so dangerous, you should leave too
I can't, I'm hunting demons
Know the saying?
"There's someone smarter than you know"
It applies to demons too
You're no match for this one
I advise you to give up
I can't, I'm sworn to obey my Master
We have to trap the bat-demon tonight
Well, if you want to kill yourself...
This is a very, very powerful demon
Not really...
Just a bat-demon which bit a girl
Ugh, she's all bloody!
How do you know?
I'm an expert too
I can't let it get away
Sorry we can't talk more, until next time!
No!
Watch out
Oh well, there goes another friend
Neng Ren of Jinshan Temple!
Demon hunter and enforcer of Buddha's law
No bluffing!
Master! Save me!
Master! Save me!
Master!
Master!
Look!
Master Fahai and Neng Ren are back
What's wrong with Brother Neng Ren?
The bat-demon poisoned him
Can he be cured?
If he's lucky...
What are you staring at?
You
No need to keep staring so long
I can't stop wondering if this is really happening
What do you think?
That you're dreaming?
Someone once told me... if I want to see someone, I should keep her in my heart then I'll really see her again
Now I know it isn't superstition, it's true
You're saying you did want to see me again?
Xu Xian, let's go on like this
Always together, alright?
Eating together, sleeping together...
Doing everything together
Won't you get tired of me?
Won't you?
But I want to take you seriously
I want to meet your parents
And when I have their permission to court you... then we'll have a formal match and get married?
Brother!
Brother!
Wake up!
The sun rose hours ago!
Brother, wake up!
What?
That's scary, Brother!
Brother!
You...
Your ears have grown pointy!
And you got fangs!
So scary!
Brother, are you turning into a demon?
Master!
Master!
Something very bad has happened!
Brother Neng Ren has run away
Come and see! Quickly!
This place isn't bad, we could live here
Change!
Hey, friend...
You want to hang yourself?
Hurry away, friend
Death by hanging is an ugly sight
You'll get nightmares
I know!
After death, your body turns purple
Your tongue hangs loose and your eyes fall out!
What?
If you don't believe me, give it a go!
You don't look like you really want to die
You don't understand
I'm a demon hunter...
But I'm turning into a demon!
Just think...
When I meet a demon I've hunted before I'll seriously lose face
if you're a demon, just be a demon
When one demon meets another...
Mostly they just nod a greeting
And lots of them don't have limbs
Who'll care about your face?
I'll let you in on a secret
Actually, I'm a demon too
You... you...
What's wrong?
Aren't we two the same now?
All demons together!
Don't look at me like that
Since we're so close now I'll teach you how to be a demon
Come on!
I'm gelded!
Come on!
A gelding!
Come on!
I just had chive for breakfast. I am going to throw up!
Bats hang upside-down, get used to it!
My head will burst!
it's full of blood!
That will make you smarter
I have a question for you...
Am I pretty?
Listen...
Right now, all I can see is stars
I'm seeing you upside-down
Pretty doesn't come into it
I see
And now, am I pretty?
Seeing you now... very pretty
So, do you get a special feeling when you look at me?
Would you like to bite my neck?
Taste my blood?
Amitabha...
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
Drink some water
What is this?
What do you think?
You bit my neck ate meat and drank blood!
You violated the Three Taboos!
No more calling yourself a monk!
From now on, be the demon you are!
Liar!
We're there.
Have we brought enough gifts?
Stop worrying!
Come on in
I didn't expect your family to live in a mansion!
It's just a broken-down old house
You're here at last!
You kept us waiting!
They're all here... this is my family
Go on in
- Go ahead
- Thanks
We need to hurry
They can't keep these forms for long
I know
I want to play too!
You can't take human form!
Scram!
Hello, everyone
I'll make the introductions
This is my father
Hello
Sir, my name is Xu Xian
He's...
He's absolutely amazing!
You're...
You're just perfect for each other!
The perfect couple!
Really...
Really nice to see!
How wonderful that you are here to propose!
Don't worry, he's fine
Auspicious day for an engagement, isn't it?
This is... my mother
She's so young!
Really?
Actually, my stepmother
I'll introduce you
Googie...
Googie...
How come you have a girl's name?
You misheard, it's Gugu
He was a chubby kid, that was his nickname
And it stuck
Hello, Gugu
Let's sit down
It's this year's latest fashion!
This is called Doodle-do Wine
It'll make you hiccup!
Doodle-do!
My parents like you to look at them when you speak
Uh...
Aren't you here today to propose?
Hurry, then, we can hardly wait
I am Xu Xian, poor and humble
I never dreamt I'd win anyone like your Susu
I've come here today because I seek your exalted permission to marry Susu
Sir...
Although I have nothing to my name I love Susu very much
No need for a dowry, just take her home! Go on!
I also want to say to Susu...
Good heavens!
Fine, just get on with it!
I want to hear what Xu Xian has to say
Sister...
Speak
I don't know what stroke of good fortune allows me to make you mine
All it took was one kiss
The wheels of fate turned and brought me to a perfect moment of tenderness and happiness
From now on every moment, every second I have I will spend beside you
To make you happy
Why did you do that?
They're reverting to their true forms
it's bad!
it's bad!
Fahai is here to exorcise us!
Run!
Run!
Get Xu Xian away from here while I distract him
Take care!
A tawdry illusion to dupe humans!
Send them all back to the demon realm!
Yes, Master!
Master!
Master, let her go!
You know what you're asking?
Come back with me
Master...
I can't go back any more
Master, take care!
We escaped?
I'm not dead?
Be calm, I'll always protect you
What are we doing here?
Weren't we getting engaged?
We did it
My parents gave us their blessing
Really?
That was easy
So now we're married
I'm your wife
We can be together for the rest of our lives
One day I'll have my own pharmacy then I'll have more money
I don't want you to suffer with me
How could that be?
As long as we're together I'll never know suffering
What's love like in this human world?
What do you mean?
I'd just like to know what kind of couple we are
Tell me
Well, there are several kinds...
Some couples are like birds in the forest
Each can fly away if they want
Not that kind!
Another kind is where the husband gets rich and dreams of his wife's death
Xu Xian!
I'll kill you!
Watch out!
Don't chase me!
You'll make me drop the herbs!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
This disease cannot be cured
Master
They are victims of demons
At best, they'll go mad... at worst, they'll die while they're alive, I must try to save them
Take precautions, don't go to strange places alone
Thank you, Master
Where did this disease come from?
So many people suddenly dying
You should take some rest
You've been making medicine for three days!
I can't
I have to find the cure
Susu, give me a hand
It mustn't stick to the bottom of the pot
Preserving vital essence concentrating vigor boosting the spirit
Aside from these fundamentals the medicine must strengthen basic functions
This is such a fierce disease
Can this medicine work?
I don't really know
Woman...
Disciples!
Foul demons!
Crossing the three realms and five planes you've harmed the people and spread chaos and evil!
By Buddha's mercy, if you choose to repent you still have a chance to live
We'd rather die than listen to your nonsense!
Beware!
The fox-demons are casting a charm!
On guard!
Yes, Master!
Maximum protection shield!
Heaven needs no hearing, ecstasy needs no sight void my sense of self
What's that mantra?
Is it real or are you making it up?
Show your real forms!
By heaven's mercy
Master, we regret our sin
Please let us go.
We beg you
Silence!
You are demons!
Return to the six paths of transmigration!
Accept your punishment with humility!
Amitabha...
Sister, Sister
What's wrong?
Are you alright?
It's nothing
That's impossible... if you keep on like this something will go very wrong
I know what I'm doing
All you care about is that Xu Xian
Adding your vital essence to that medicine is costing you centuries of self-improvement
I don't want to see him work so hard
I want to help him
But you may not live to see him again!
It can't be that bad
Of course it is
I have to go
Wait!
Ah, Dr Xu is here
Dr Xu, thank you!
You're truly our savior
We owe you our lives
You and your wife are such good people
Don't rush
There's enough for everyone
Thank you
Master, you should take some too
It cures sickness and prevents infection
Thank you
Master...
Did you mix this medicine?
Yes
No-one helped you?
Yes, my wife did
You are the quintessence of benevolence
Take this spirit dagger as a token of thanks
I can't, Master, I'm just doing my duty
You shouldn't refuse a gift from a senior
Keep it to protect yourself
Thank you, Master
Amitabha...
You think you can run?
You made the cure for the fox-demon's poison
So what?
Making it has cost you centuries of your vital essence
You're kind to the ordinary people
But in your eyes, all we do is harm people
Despite good intentions, you will harm someone
Who will I harm?
You should know that
Xu Xian is my true love, how could I harm him?
You're from different realms!
Being together you drain his life-force and distort his destiny
Human lives are short, and true love is rare
He didn't choose to love you, you took his love
What does that matter?
He's happy with me
Go chant your sutras!
You know nothing of love if Xu Xian knew you are a snake would he still love you?
I truly love him
if that's the case, shed your own tears
Don't make him shed tears over you
Since you're so benevolent I'll let you go this time
if I see you again in this realm, there'II be no mercy
Susu, I'm home
So soon?
You're back...
Look!
What's special about today?
Well, everyone else is celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival while I am celebrating the best day I've ever had!
The day my medicine cured everyone!
Really?
That's wonderful
The old villagers were so grateful
They gave us all this food
Susu, thank you for working so hard
Here, a toast to you
I'm hungry
Here, try this
it's good
You have some too
What's wrong?
What kind of wine is this?
They distilled it themselves
Sulphur-flower wine!
That's right it's a festival tradition, it wards off snake-bites
Susu?
Susu?
What's wrong?
Susu!
Susu?
Susu?
What's the matter?
Are you alright?
I'm alright
Susu!
Why lock the door?
Open it!
Susun.
Don't frighten me!
Susun.
What's the matter?
Susu!
Susu!
Susu!
Susu, what are you doing?
Open the door!
Susu, don't frighten me
Xu Xian...
Do you recall what you said to me when you proposed?
I want to hear you say it again
I knew you were playing a trick on me!
I'd rather not repeat it if you don't I might never hear it again
Alright, alright
I'll say it
But then you must open the door!
Alright
"All it took was one kiss"
"I'm sure that the wheels of fate turned..."
"...and brought me to a perfect moment..."
"...of tenderness and happiness"
"From now on..."
"...every moment, every second I have..."
will spend beside you..."
"...to make you happy"
Susu!
Susu!
Open the door, Susu!
I gave you a chance
You didn't leave, so now I must take you
Monk...
Why are you intent on destroying our happiness?
Susu!
Who are you talking to?
Don't chase her
She was stabbed with the spirit dagger
Losing vital essence, she can't take human form
Master, where is my wife?
Did the white snake eat her?
The white snake was your wife
You married a thousand-year-old snake demon
Impossible!
Impossible!
Impossible!
Sister, I'll give you some of my vital essence
it's no use
You have only a few centuries' worth
That spirit dagger had thousands!
We were wrong to come here
It wasn't worth it, to see you like this
Maybe I shouldn't have done it...
But I have no regrets
Only now do I know what true love is
Love...
Is it really so important?
Tell me...
How can I save Susu?
The one thing that might is spirit herb
It can bring the dead back to life
It only grows in the Lei Feng Pagoda
A demon like me can't even get in there!
Plus, there is only a single sprout
It is really, really scary. They say fire can't even burn it!
Even if it takes braving swords and seas of fire I shall save Susu
I can't take you any further
You dare to steal the spirit herb?
Thief!
Which is the real spirit herb?
You will know after your death
I'll find it even if it kills me!
I must save Susu!
There's only a single sprout.
Fire can't even burn it!
They found us!
Did you get the spirit herb?
I did then let's get out of here!
It is going to be a disaster If they catch you
You take the spirit herb, I'll distract them
Demons have been confined in Lei Feng Pagoda for aeons!
The spirit herb kept them trapped
Your theft has caused a catastrophe!
Let me go! Why are you keeping me here?
I needed it to save her!
I wounded Susu
Master, let me go! Let me go!
I wounded Susu
Master, we can't hold them much longer
Call all the senior monks, now!
We'll cast the Luohan spell!
I got spirit herb!
Spirit herb?
From where?
Xu Xian gave it to me
Where is he?
The monks took him
Disciples!
Seal the main hall with a maximum protection spell!
Maximum protection in force!
Now we cast the spell!
Any interruption will kill him!
Leave!
You trespass on hallowed ground!
Fahai, give me my Xu Xian!
You should be thankful you aren't dead
Why this further trouble?
Release him and I'll go at once
He stole the spirit herb for you
He's in great danger because evil spirits possessed him!
Now we're breaking your spell!
I possessed him?
That cannot be...
I want to see him
He's in a life-or-death struggle
Interrupting the ritual will end his life and threaten those around him
Relations between humans and demons can bring no good
You...
You're just coming between my sister and Xu Xian!
If you won't release him, I'll fight you!
If I don't leave with Xu Xian, I'll flood Jinshan!
You are selfish!
How many lives will you threaten?
I will be forced to put an end to you unless you stop
Very well...
You're forcing me!
Get the important ones first.
Quick!
Forward, brothers!
Charge!
Bite them!
Break their human chain!
Xu Xian!
Xu Xian!
Xu Xian?
You...
It's me, Susu
Susu?
Who is Susu?
I'm your wife
When did I get married?
Do you remember how we met?
Fahai, what horrible magic did you use to make him forget me?
As I told you, evil spirits possessed him
You broke in and disrupted the Luohan spell!
You're the one who's harmed Xu Xian!
What Luohan spell?
What possession?
You're making it up!
You just want Xu Xian to leave me
You're a monster!
Qingqing!
Brother Neng Ren!
Brother Neng Ren!
I have been a dharma defender all my life to maintain natural order and ethical conduct
Why did the calamity happen instead?
Have I been too stubborn?
Was I really wrong?
Why is it that every time I wake up you're beside me?
Open the door!
Let me out!
Let me see Xu Xian once more!
I don't care if you turn me to dust and scatter me
The love we had... was it not real?
Where is all your 'great benevolence' now?
Can't we see each other just once more?
Just once...
I'll accept my punishment
Amitabha...
Your mercy is boundless...
I understand...
Amitabha...
Xu Xian!
You're suffering...
I don't recognize you...
But for some reason I don't understand when I see you shedding tears my heart aches for you
Don't be upset, I don't want you to cry
I'll cry for both of us
I don't mind that you've forgotten me
My own memories are enough
Before I first saw you I meditated for a thousand years
But those thousand years were worth less than a moment with you
You'll never know how I've had to suffer
But even if I die I'll have no regrets
Susun.
"Your hair tickles my heart"
"Your eyes lingers in my mind"
"I can bear any hardships to be with you"
"Our love shall remain in the dark"
"year after year"
"but nothing can change it"
"Nothing at all"
"I will be there"
"if you are there"
"I vow to live for you"
"coz I can lose anything but you"
"Love is right"
"if there is joy between us"
"Our love shall survive"
"longer than any time"
"I vow to live for you"
"till the end of time"
"coz I can lose anything but you"
"Love is right"
"if the tortures on me are to protect you"
"Our love shall survive"
"longer than any time"
"And we'll meet again in our next lives"
Susun.
For the two of them that was probably the best outcome
I never want to love anyone as she loved him
You... you'll never be much good as a demon
Neng Ren...
That new form you have...
It kind of suits you
Hang on, hang on. Come on.
Where are you, Charlie?
More importantly, where is my money?
- You're into me for 30 grand.
- Jack, I'm going to pay you.
This ain't Jack!
It's Bill Panner.
You owe Jack money, too?
You pay me first!
Bill.
We're good, buddy.
I got your money.
It's right here in my hand.
Why don't we meet up on the?
- Your phone's going all screwy.
Hello?
- I'm losing you.
I can't hear what you're say...
Hey, mister. Is that Ambush?
- Yeah.
- Can we see him?
- You want to see him?
- Yeah.
Give me a minute.
This... is Ambush.
Wakey, wakey.
- What robot is he fighting?
- Actually he's going to fight...
Whoa, little lady.
What are you doing?
Can we get a picture with him?
Sure. For five dollars.
You want five dollars?
Seriously?
No, I want five dollars immediately.
Come on, guys.
- All right, I'm kidding. Three bucks.
- Whatever.
- How about $2.50?
- You suck!
It's going to be one of those towns, huh?
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.
Please take your seats.
We're almost ready to get this thing started.
I was told my bot was fighting an 800-pound steer.
That is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton.
Time has not been good to you, my friend.
- Ricky, we got a big problem here.
- Slow down there, hoss.
Last time I saw you, you were staring at the ceiling at the Sam Houston Center with the taste of my right cross all over your face.
- Are we good to go here?
- Yeah.
We agreed that my boxer would fight an 800-pound steer for three grand.
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir. We did.
That bull is like 2,000 pounds.
I'll tell you something.
Your bot don't fight, you don't get paid!
How about that?
Get the hell out of here.
Why don't we make this more interesting.
My bot against your bull, straight up.
- How much?
- Twenty grand, winner takes all.
- Twenty grand.
You got 20 grand?
- In a safe in my truck.
All right, Charlie.
Twenty grand it is, but if you lose and you welch,
I'll come after you and beat you to within an inch of your life.
You know that I can do that because I already done done it!
In life you get too close, in the ring you stand back like a girl.
All right. Shake and pow!
Just like that once again.
You want to dance again?
Cheer for this guy. Give him some luck.
He needs some luck, y'all.
Don't touch that bull.
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask, do we have any fans of robot boxing here today?
Now, listen, friends, I understand we can't all afford to go all the way over there to Dallas and pay $300 for one of those World Robot Boxing League fights.
So, I decided that I would bring a robot boxing match right here to our little fair here in San Leandro.
How about that?
Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you,
Ambush!
Let's do it!
All right, big fella.
He's a big fella, ain't he?
Take a turn.
Let them see how beautiful you are.
Show them some power.
Look at that.
He's getting all kung fu-y on us.
Yeah, big fella.
Ambush's opponent today, he's last year's runner-up in the baddest of the bulls competition, ladies and gentlemen,
Black Thunder!
- Let's get it on!
- Let's get this thing started.
Is that all you got?
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.
Take him, take him.
Ambush lays the smackdown on that prime beef.
I got more for you, big fella.
We're just getting started.
OK. Jump, now!
Ambush, decks Black Thunder, but when you mess with the bull, you're going to get the horns.
You like that. I can tell. You like that.
Turn around!
Ricky!
Ricky, stop this thing!
Come on.
We're still in this thing.
Just hop. Hop.
That's it. Come on.
Ricky, enough!
Enough!
I can't hear you over the sound of your robot being destroyed.
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Come on, get up.
Get up!
Come on!
No!
Come on, no. No, no, no!
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for our warriors out here today at the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.
Thank you for coming out, and we'll see you next time, because there will be one.
Give me that leg.
Sure. For five dollars.
All right! That was ridiculous fun, now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?
I'm going to come by for my money, Charlie boy.
You best have it.
- Everybody say "hey!"
- Hey!
- Everybody say "ho!"
- Ho!
How about that?
How you doing there, little robot?
My keys, damn it.
One more step and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.
Charlie, relax.
I'm not paying you.
That was a bogus fight.
It cost me my last robot.
- Just listen to us.
- Do you recall Caroline Fallon?
She's my ex-girlfriend.
I haven't seen her in ten years.
What does she want?
Nothing. She died.
Do you recall Max Kenton?
He's my son.
He's got to be nine.
- Eleven.
- Eleven. OK.
Is he dead, too?
No, he's fine. That's why we're here.
This court is convened to address the custodial status of one Max Kenton, age 11.
Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased. Father, Charles Kenton.
Debra Fallon Barnes, you're the boy's aunt.
As I've already told you, my husband, Marvin, is wealthy, and we can more than provide for Max.
I appreciate that, but per Texas state law, without a written will next of kin retains custody.
Charles Kenton, who is aware of this custody hearing, and we are expecting him...
I need a new robot now.
I had a big fight for Ambush next Saturday.
I got to show up with something.
Noisy Boy is for sale?
In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.
How much? That's a good deal.
What's wrong with him?
I can live with that.
I don't have it.
Charles Kenton waived all of his rights to custody right after the boy was born.
I can more than provide for Max.
Please be Charles Kenton.
Charlie, yeah.
I'm here to sign some paper that releases my rights to the custody of my son.
That's why I'm here.
Do I need to be here?
Charlie.
Do you even remember me?
- Debra, Caroline's sister.
- Yeah, Debra.
How are you?
Mr. Kenton.
Please take a seat.
Your Honor, may I please go and see my nephew now?
Yes, you may.
- How about you, Mr. Kenton?
- What?
You can spend some time with him, if you'd like.
- With the kid?
- Yeah, the kid.
- Max. Your son?
- All right.
You've been working with those robots for so long, you've become one.
Honey, you wait right here.
I'm going to be back.
You take all the time you need, sweetheart.
Your Honor, I'd like to, at this juncture, step out and call my attorney, if that's all right.
Please.
Come on. Come on. There you are.
He'll be in a foster home.
No, they find good families.
Energetic. Yeah.
Thanks, Michael.
I will. OK.
- Marvin Barnes.
I'm Debra's husband.
- Right, yeah.
Debra really wants to adopt Max.
- I'm up for it.
But...
- Seventy-five grand.
$75,000?
You're serious?
The thing is... we're supposed to go to Italy this summer with my oldest friend and his wife.
Two months in Tuscany and all over.
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.
We'll be back in New York by the end of August.
In August. A hundred.
- $100,000?
- You heard me.
- You're crazy.
- Not nearly as crazy as your wife if you tell her I just signed over that kid to the state of Texas.
There's a real way everyone gets what they want here.
So here's what you're going to do.
You're going to tell your wife I'll only sign over custody to her if I get to spend the summer with the kid first.
Just tell her how guilty she made me feel for being such a terrible absentee dad, how I want to make good with junior, a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero and everybody wins.
OK. But not a word about the money to Debra, you understand?
I understand.
I'll give you 50 grand tonight when we drop off Max and the other 50 when we get back in August and you deliver him to us in New York.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Your Honor, I'm happy we all took the time to make the best decision for everyone.
- Happy? - Yeah, it's me.
I'm buying Noisy Boy.
I got the money.
Take him to Tallet's Gym and I'll meet you there.
Hello?
Bailey?
Some guy is here with the robot you're buying, and it smells like disaster to me.
Nice to see you, too. - Might I also say how cute you look.
God, I need a shower. You want to take a shower?
Come on.
Let me make something clear.
A creepy dude with a robot in a box has been sitting outside my gym for two hours.
Putting aside the fact that you're doing what I'm guessing is a black market deal on my doorstep, how will you pay him when Ambush just got destroyed?
The money is on its way.
Just distract him.
I have been. It's exhausting.
- You're the best. - Yeah?
Really?
Is that why you're buying a $45,000 robot when you owe me six grand in rent?
- Because I'm the best?
- Three.
Six. There is a guy with real money who wants to buy this place.
Come on. Like you're really going to sell your dad's gym.
If you don't make rent, I can't make payments and I won't have a choice.
Your father would climb out of his grave and kick your ass - My father would climb out of his grave and kick your ass.
Bailey?
- Don't.
- Don't what?
Don't do that.
- Don't what?
- Don't do that thing.
- No, you like that thing.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No, I don't like that thing.
I used to. Once. Briefly.
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.
Marvin.
Your money has arrived.
Marv.
Fifty grand, as promised.
Here are all our numbers and contact info over in Europe.
So that's everything there.
So Marvin tells me you want this time with Max.
- Yeah.
- You did the right thing, giving me custody.
Caroline would have wanted that.
Now, have him back in New York on August 27th.
That's a deal.
OK, let's go get Max. OK? Let's get Max.
It's OK. You want to go around the other side here and I'll get Max?
Hey. Max. See you, pal.
Max, we'll see you at the end of the summer, honey.
I'm Charlie.
It's been a long time. You know, I'm your...
- You screwed me.
- Nice mouth.
Do you know where they're going?
- Italy?
- Yeah, Italy.
So how did I get stuck here with you?
Relax, kid. You got a whole life of fine living ahead of you.
Charlie!
Dude's pissed. He's going to take off.
- Did Marvin give you that money?
- Here, just close the deal.
I'll be right there, OK?
- I'm Bailey.
- Max.
Max Kenton.
- So this is your...
- Yeah, it's him.
Don't worry about it, OK?
I'm looking at you two and...
Just go and put Noisy in the shop, please? Thank you.
You're going to stay here with her while I'm on the road.
- How much did he give you?
- You're coming at this the wrong way.
No, tell me. I want to know.
Fifty thousand, OK?
He gave me $50,000 to sign you over to her.
Will you shut up now?
You sold me?
Sounds worse than it is.
- Really.
- It's to take care of you.
Give me half the money and you won't have to.
- Where are you going to go?
- Give me the money. I'll be fine.
I told your aunt I'll get you to New York at the end of the summer.
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?
You sold me for 50 grand.
You owe me half!
I don't have it!
I spent the money on a robot.
It's gone!
OK? Gone!
I'm through here.
What do we got?
Noisy Boy has arrived.
That's a lot of airline stickers and customs tags.
- He's been all over the world.
- London, Japan, Brazil, São Paulo...
Hasn't seen North American soil in over two years.
Maybe that's why you got such a good price, genius.
Decided to stay?
This is Bailey.
She'll be looking after you for a few weeks.
I need you to look after the kid for a few weeks.
- I want half that money.
- Are we back to this again?
Is there a real robot boxer in there?
Noisy Boy's in there. You ever heard of him?
Of course.
He fought Rubicon for the WRB belt in 2016.
Holy crap, he looks amazing.
His composite armor has been replaced.
Let's see if the insides look as good.
I've watched that fight with Rubicon like 20 times.
He should have had him in the third round, but Rubicon got lucky with a huge right and ended it.
Relax, kid, he's on our side.
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.
You know he has voice recognition, right?
- No, he doesn't.
- He didn't in the League.
When Noisy fought in Brazil, they must have put it in.
Brazilians are crazy about that talk-to-your-robot crap.
Right, left, uppercut!
Doesn't work.
Right, left, uppercut!
I knew that price was too good to be true. We got screwed.
- Let me see if I can fix it.
- Look how good he looks, too.
Give me two seconds. Let me look at something!
- Why didn't you ask to look at it? - Relax!
Was that Japanese?
Let me see if I can reset him to English.
How do you know Japanese?
Video games.
You play video games in Japanese?
Japanese bootlegs are always better.
Give me that.
He's reset to English, and I found his command matrix.
They have pre-loaded a bunch of combinations.
They should be listed here.
Top salvo!
Gravity One Downtown!
I was due for some good luck!
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
Bailey, help me put him in the truck.
I am going to go and get your money.
- Give me the keys.
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.
- Why not?
Because I don't want you with me, OK?
I'm either coming with you, or you're fishing for your keys in the sewer.
Your choice.
What's it going to be, old man?
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?
- Don't do that again.
- That's scaring you, isn't it?
Don't do this again?
Get in. Just get in.
Give me the keys first.
Wait till I get in the truck.
Thanks, Big Pops.
Sweet ride.
Put on your seatbelt and don't talk.
I'm taking all bets!
Keep up.
Stay close.
Charlie Kenton is in the house!
- All right, all right.
- Come on, man!
- Is that Noisy Boy?
- The one and only.
That's Noisy Boy!
Noisy's been in Japan.
Softer bots over there.
- Sure you want to fight him tonight?
- What do you got?
He can take any bot in this place. You know it.
You can have any undercard you want.
Five thousand guaranteed.
A thousand every round your bot survives.
Fight till the death!
No. Give me the main event.
- Come on.
- This is Noisy Boy.
An original Tak Mashido bot.
He was a World Robot League boxer.
You want to fight Midas?
Fifty thousand guaranteed, winner takes all.
Fifty?
Really, 50?
Now you're talking.
Listen, listen. No, look.
- Listen!
- Give me a sec.
We should take an undercard fight, make a little cash and get out of here!
First, there is no "we."
Second, he's going to crush Midas, and I'm going to make real cash!
We'll take Midas!
Tonight, our main event features the gold-blooded killer!
This pimped-out punk is programmed for pain!
I give to you the mighty Midas!
Against a bot who ran with the big boys in the WRB!
He's been on an exile tour overseas, but now he's back home, and he's ready to make some noise!
Take your first look in a long time at Noisy Boy!
Crash Palace, who's ready for some destruction?
!
Let's make some money! Come on!
We have Midas against Noisy Boy.
Noisy Boy against Midas.
You've been waiting all night for this match up, Crash Palace!
Scimitar right!
Did you see that?
Easy money, easy money all night. All night long!
Come on!
It's not over yet. Let's go!
Skull salvo!
Firefight!
- Yeah!
Go, Noisy!
- Undercard, huh?
Shockfist!
Get in there.
Shogun Trinity!
Let's finish him.
Gravity Slam, Uptown!
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!
Full Metal Feud!
Bring it!
Southpaw!
Pain Revolution!
I got something for you.
Don't you run from me!
You can't run from me!
Get up!
That's illegal!
This is the underworld.
There are no rules!
Now we're seeing the Midas touch.
No. Hands up!
Get back in that corner, bitch, and take this whooping like a man!
He's getting killed in there!
It's a headset!
You talk into it and you tell him what to do!
Panic Shield!
That's it.
One-Two Overlord!
No, no.
Shatter Punch!
- Five Recall!
- Get some!
Jab, jab!
Right roundhouse!
Did he just spit his juice in Midas's face?
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!
It's party time now, Crash Palace!
Use your left!
Noisy's trying to do something with his one arm!
But Midas pins him, and Daddy goes to work!
No, no! Get up!
Get some!
Move! Get out of the corner!
Midas!
Midas!
Midas!
Somebody's ready to serve up a decappuccino!
I got something for you! You ready?
Good night!
That's a home run for Midas.
And so long to Noisy Boy.
That sucked.
You hungry?
I saved what's left of Noisy's voice recognition board.
Other than that, he's trash.
I got to get a new robot together.
I need to find a mainframe. What?
- I hate hamburgers.
- What kid hates burgers?
Fine. More for me. Here, drink this.
You never should have taken that fight.
Really?
Really?
Thanks, genius.
Do you even think about the stuff you do before you do it?
You had no idea how to fight that fight.
Those combination codes, you didn't know what half of them even meant.
You threw them in there cocky and half-assed.
- You never gave him a chance.
- He wasn't that good.
Noisy Boy was a great robot.
Was.
Was a great robot back in the League, back in the day.
But look around you.
This place is where once great robots go to die.
So throw him away.
That's what you do, right?
Anything you don't need you throw away.
Wow.
It's been a long night.
If you want to sleep indoors tonight, shut up and get in the truck.
Don't look at me like that way. Get in the truck!
They gave me 400 for his head.
You stay put. I'm going to look for parts.
I'm coming with you.
That drink has my heart pounding.
If I sit in this truck by myself, my head will explode.
Whatever. Just keep up.
Crap.
Stay back.
All right, keep up.
These searchlights are automated, but you got to time them right, so stay close.
It's all right.
Come on, come on.
- We're going to get caught.
- Come on.
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.
Quick, quick.
Down in here! Go, go, go!
Robots are on the east side.
We got to be quick in here.
Once we're through here, there's no more searchlights.
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?
Anything I could use to put a fighting bot together.
- Hey, look.
- What?
It's so small.
Yeah. That's before your time.
That's a Generation One, the very first fighting bot.
They wanted them to look like us.
The more human, the better.
Crazy how quick everything changed.
Put that in the cart.
- What changed?
- A good question.
Human boxing.
- It just faded.
- Why?
Because the money moved on.
People wanted more carnage, more show.
You had the whole Brazilian underground, the Gracies, the Machados, jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, and a thousand styles in between.
Full-on ground-and-pound.
- Look at this.
- What's that?
I don't know.
Not bad. Good spot.
You still had human fighters, human bodies, so you couldn't give the people what they really wanted:
True, no-holds-barred violence.
The next logical step, get the humans out of there and let the machines kill each other.
Do you miss it?
- Boxing. Do you miss it?
- Careful.
What?
I want to know.
Careful, you're on a cliff.
That's a long way down.
If you fell, you'd definitely...
Charlie, help me!
Charlie!
- Charlie!
- Max! Max!
Max!
- Try not to move!
- I'm on some sort of robot arm.
Wait! Just easy, easy.
Give me your hand.
Nice and easy.
Very slowly.
Good.
Don't look down. Look at me.
Look at me.
That's it!
I've got you!
You don't have to be scared. I got you!
- It's so far!
- It's OK. I got you.
Give me your other hand. Nice and slow.
Just give me your other hand very slowly.
Reach back.
Come on.
Reach!
Look at me.
We're going to do this together.
You and me. Just look at me. That's it.
One... two... three!
That's it.
I got you! I got you.
I got you. I got you.
You're safe. You're safe.
All right, I got you.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Come here. Easy. Easy.
You all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I told you it was dangerous.
Careful.
We're still on the edge here.
Charlie, I think there's a whole robot in there.
So what? Let's go.
Come on.
I'm taking him with me.
He saved my life.
He did not save your life.
I saved your life.
Let's go.
Just bring the cart to the edge.
I'll use the winch to get him out.
You want that piece of junk?
You get the cart yourself.
I'm through here.
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?
That's it.
His head does make a nice addition to the front of the Crash Palace.
- It's not funny.
- Let's get a robot, you and me.
Good idea.
You're broke. I'm almost there myself.
- You destroyed the best shot you had.
- We'll put one together.
You're brilliant at this.
There's good stuff here.
- There's nothing here.
- There is. Look.
All your junk is... it's junk.
You're not even in the game any more.
- It's all garbage.
- I heard you. It's garbage.
Don't get loud with me.
- You're your problem.
- What's that supposed to mean?
I have been here for you a long time.
In the ring, out of the ring, and the whole ugly spiral down, and I'm tired.
My father invested everything he had in your fight career.
We loved...
He loved you like family.
And this is his home.
I'm just trying not to let it die.
That's my plan.
What's yours?
You're done, right?
You're finally done?
Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.
I got nothing left.
All right.
Maybe there's something here.
This robot the kid brought in last night.
Would you look at it for me?
Please?
I've never seen anything like it before.
He's Generation Two, but barely.
I found a power cell that fits him, and I hooked him up to this old G-2 remote.
You can move him around, but he's crap.
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him, make a few hundred bucks.
Stop.
It's my robot!
It took me half the night dragging him out of there.
He's mine.
He's yours? Yeah.
But the parts we're putting in him are mine!
You idiots should see if he powers up before you fight over him.
What happened to you?
Watch out. Stay back.
Looks like he's got a shadow function.
That's pretty rare.
He can mime your movements and store them in memory.
- Is there anything here we could use?
There's a bucket...
There's a bucket I use to wash the truck.
Use it and clean him up.
He smells like crap.
Wash yourself off, too, while you're at it. You stink.
I switched him to remote.
It's pretty basic.
Just use the toggles here to steer him and walk him.
- You play video games, right?
- Of course.
Same idea, only this one's a thousand-pound robot.
Cool.
"Atom."
His name is Atom.
Can we get him a fight?
I don't think he was ever a boxing robot.
He's a G-2, built in early 2014.
He was a sparring bot.
They must have built robots like this one that could mirror the fighting style of any other robot.
OK, so can we get him a fight?
Are you not listening?
He's a sparring bot.
Built to take a lot of hits, but never dishing out any real punishment.
You could always sell him off for parts.
- Can't you get him a fight?
- "Why can't you get him a fight?"
You want me to put him in some bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?
I saw how scared you were at Crash Palace.
The places that would let you fight this robot would make you pee your pants.
Excellent.
Get him a fight.
Stubborn kid.
Surprise, surprise.
Let's take a walk.
Can you understand me?
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.
You've known Charlie a long time.
Too long.
We both kind of grew up in this gym.
My dad, he trained him.
That's them.
That's Charlie.
- What was he like?
- As a boxer?
- As anything.
- He was something.
He was lean, tough.
No quit, no fear.
Come here. I want to show you something.
I have this newspaper article from Phoenix 2007 when Charlie fought Nico Tandy, the top contender.
You were at the Nico Tandy fight?
I was.
Charlie was supposed to be a warm-up fight, an easy win.
Nico wasn't even supposed to break a sweat, but... nobody told Charlie that, so he just kept coming and coming at him.
Check this out.
That's Charlie.
First, Nico couldn't believe the balls on this nobody.
But Charlie kept coming, and that's when Nico looked scared.
- Really?
- Really.
He was toying with Nico.
The top contender, number two in the world, and Charlie was dancing with him.
Charlie was floating inches off the canvas that night.
He was like a ghost. Nico couldn't even see him.
I could.
He was beautiful.
He was beautiful.
So what happened?
Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass in the 12th round.
Twice.
Second time for good.
Lights out.
You were ahead on the scorecards
- going into the 12th round.
- Nico Tandy rung my bell and went on to be the undefeated world champ for the next three years.
- He knocked you out?
- Yeah. So did a lot of guys.
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.
- 24 and 19.
It's not exactly a career.
- But every fight a knockout.
- Yeah. - Win or lose, fight's not over - till someone's on the mat.
- Your old man taught me that.
- Damn straight he taught you that.
- Who else did you fight?
- Go get your stuff together.
I don't need to.
Did you fight for the title?
Yeah, you do.
We leave in an hour. Go.
Wow. Here.
Keep it.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
I like that kid.
He likes you.
- What I said yesterday was...
- No, nothing more to say.
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight to see if I can get a partner or raise money to get a new bot.
That's what you wanted, right?
Me gone?
Yeah, that's what I wanted.
OK.
Look.
The champ is here.
Zeus is here.
Yeah.
Zeus!
No one has ever gone two rounds with this monster. Two rounds!
The champ puts his Real Steel world championship belt on the line tonight.
He just may have a real fight on his hands.
Zeus, greatest robot boxer of all time. Ever.
End of story. Good night!
- So cool. It's so cool.
- What?
Come on.
Listen up. I got to go find Finn.
I want you to stay in this area.
Out of the way.
Champ coming through.
Zeus coming through.
Move, move. Champ coming through.
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind the father/daughter Zeus team.
They say your father's the money and you are the mind behind Zeus.
You're very kind, but I assure you, the mind behind Zeus belongs to the great Tak Mashido.
What did it take to lure the reclusive genius, former boy wonder and arguably the most important bot designer in the history of the sport out of retirement?
Why don't you ask him yourself?
Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?
Zeus is autonomous and constantly evolving during a fight.
With his adaptive operating system, he recognizes patterns and rewrites his fight code instantaneously.
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there, are you saying that Zeus?
I'm saying that no matter what happens in that ring... the result of any fight is inevitable.
What Zeus sees... he kills.
Sweet.
I'm never going into business with you.
I just need a break here.
You got that old bot truck out there.
You always got something in there.
I got an old sparring bot, ain't worth the paint left on it.
What am I supposed to do with that?
The Zoo.
Take him to the Zoo.
They fight there tomorrow.
Even I wouldn't be caught dead at the Zoo.
I just need a little loan.
What?
- You're serious, Charlie?
- A loan.
Couple hundred. Few hundred.
Whatever you got.
You know I'm good for it.
I know you, and as much as I like you, dude... you're a bad bet, brother.
Right, yeah.
Did you see that?
That's what's left of Axelrod.
Where you been?
I told you to stay put.
You should have seen him.
Zeus was, like, amazing!
- Amazing, huh?
- Unbelievable, yeah.
He was just peppering Axelrod with punches, but so fast.
It was incredible.
Axelrod didn't even land a punch.
He didn't even survive the first round.
Is that what you think boxing is?
Zeus beating up some piece of steel that they feed him?
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
And that is what boxing is now.
Deal with it.
And I love it, and I'm in it now.
You're in it now, are you?
You and your G-2 sparring bot?
He's more than that.
If you'd get us a fight, you'd see.
You're in luck, kid.
There's a lovely place called the Zoo.
Tomorrow afternoon, you'll get your fight.
- Great.
- And it will be the end.
I told you I hate hamburgers!
It's a burrito!
Right uppercut.
Left uppercut.
Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.
Again.
Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.
You been up all night?
Yeah. I cleaned him up.
I'm using shadow mode to program some fight moves and sync them to the remote.
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch you were showing him.
That's lethal stuff.
Let's do this.
Let's do breakfast first.
You know you're bringing him home in pieces, right?
We'll see.
- Let me deal with this.
- Charlie Kenton.
This is Max.
Kingpin.
Call me Kingpin.
- All right, Kingpin, so...
- How much a round?
We on a field trip?
All right.
He can fight my robot Metro.
I'll give you a hundred bucks for one two-minute round.
- Take it.
- Three hundred.
One hundred.
Baby boy, I'm going to give you $100 just to get in with Metro.
How about 500 for two rounds?
Two rounds.
Son, he ain't going to survive one round.
- What if he does?
- He ain't.
Let's just say he does.
If he's still standing after one round...
I'll give you a thousand bucks.
Shut it!
But if he dies in there, which he will, junior...
I get to keep what's left.
Take the hundred.
Deal.
We're on. We on!
Let's go!
- You should have taken the hundred.
- I got us a thousand.
Yeah, if he wins.
You want me to drive?
He's my bot. I got this!
This ain't a video game.
This is for real. Right here.
You said he's coming home in pieces.
What difference does it make?
All right.
I got this.
Let's get it on!
Let's get it on!
Let's get it on like Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!
Give me a bell!
Give me a bell!
Don't watch Atom.
Watch your opponent.
Watch out for that foot.
He's looking to pin you.
I told you to watch for that foot plant. Come on.
Here comes the sledgehammer.
Did you see that?
- Come on! Get him!
- Don't yell at him, control him.
Slip right.
Back step.
Duck.
- You're welcome.
- Shut up! You're not helping!
Actually, I think I am.
Backhand.
You got speed on this guy.
Just keep moving. Bob.
Slip out of that corner.
Keep moving!
Bob and weave!
That's it!
Now you're listening to me.
He can take a hit. I'll give you this. Your bot can take a hit.
You better slip that headlock.
This ain't gonna end well for you.
I'm trying!
Thirty seconds!
Thirty...
Half a minute.
Half a minute!
Keep moving!
Just move!
You've got 20 seconds!
That's a thousand bucks.
Twenty seconds.
Let me take over!
Move, then.
Come on.
Get up, Atom.
Get up, Atom.
Count with me! Count with me!
One!
- Get up!
- You know you're talking to a machine?
Four!
Five!
Six!
Get up, Atom!
I'm going to fix it!
I'm going to fix it!
Come on, now.
- This thousand bucks...
- Yeah, thousand.
Double or nothing he can't make another round.
- Yeah, thanks anyway.
- Deal. Double or nothing.
Baby boy said it!
We're back on! We on!
Are you crazy?
You threw away a thousand bucks!
He can barely stand up in there.
Look. I really need the money.
I know. Let's work.
Jesus.
- Watch that. Watch that.
- I got that.
- I got it.
- That's a system failure!
- I don't got it.
- He's going down.
- Yes!
- No!
Start the count!
Start the count!
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Five!
Six!
Seven!
Eight!
Nine!
Ten!
You did it!
We did it!
Wow!
Time to go. Come on.
Grab your robot.
I know, I know!
I know!
I know!
Kingpin, pay up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, I know.
- We owned! - Let's go.
Come on, come on.
- Yeah?
- Have I got a fight for you.
Saturday night.
Guaranteed four grand.
Seven if he wins.
Four grand?
You're on. Let's go!
Bailey, it's me.
He won.
Can you believe that?
The kid's robot actually won.
I know.
Happy?
Oh, my God. Yeah.
He's been bit.
He's been bit real bad.
Anyway...
I just wanted you to know.
Jab, jab, hook.
Jab, jab, hook.
I think you have to move your feet.
Your feet.
Feet.
Nice moves, kid.
How long you been out here?
Check it out.
I just spent the night doing something I think is amazing.
Incredibly amazing.
If it works, you know?
- You know his remote was spotty?
- Yeah.
I killed it. Got rid of it.
We don't need it any more.
How did you?
I had to start over.
But I was able to use the spin frame from Ambush and take the circuitry sleeve out of Noisy Boy, and it works.
He knows nothing, but it works.
It really, really works.
What works?
I got to turn it on.
Left jab, right uppercut!
You put Noisy's voice recognition into Atom?
- Pretty smart, kid.
- Smart?
It could be genius!
It could be the most incredible thing in the history of the entire world!
Easy there, chief.
Did you drink all these sodas?
I might have had a few.
I need you to teach him to box.
Are you kidding me?
He's not advanced enough to handle Noisy's voice command.
So he needs your moves.
Your commands.
- Start over from the ground up.
- Forget it.
You were a boxer.
Yesterday at the Zoo, you could see things happen before they even happened.
I haven't boxed in a long time.
I'm not starting now.
- Who's going to teach him to fight?
- You're doing fine.
You don't need me.
Sorry.
That was really cool, though, that dance.
You should do that on Saturday night.
- Don't make fun of me.
- I'm serious.
Before the fight, when you guys take the ring, you should do it.
There's no way I'm dancing with a robot in front of a boxing crowd.
Are you kidding me?
This is just a show.
People want to see something they've never seen.
Look. You think of all the greats.
Think Ali, Sugar Ray, Prince Rakim, Gammer, they all had their nicknames.
They had their personae. They all had flair.
Now you?
You might not have much robot, but with that dance, you got flair.
Plus, you're a kid.
People love that kid thing.
- What are you?
Like nine?
Ten?
- I'm 11.
Are you sure you're 11?
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.
Anyway, the point is people want to see that.
You're really not messing with me?
I am not messing with you.
They're going to love it.
- Cool.
- But...
- What?
- I won't do it unless you help me.
I can't dance.
You're on your own there.
No. Boxing.
- Oh, I see.
- I program the robot.
- You teach him to box.
- And you dance.
And you dance.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Deal.
Deal.
It's going to be cool.
Nice.
You're going to be punching guys bigger.
You're going to have to punch up.
That's it.
Nice.
You, too, old man?
Come on. Let's get to work.
Nice!
Let's do that again.
Nice.
Three-punch combo.
Combo.
Again. Again.
Faster. Faster. Nice.
You're not even out of breath.
I like it.
Let's see how you move.
That's good.
Step around!
Left hook!
Left hook!
That's it. Every time.
Upper cut!
Great fight, fellas.
105.5, WRUT, the satellite home of robot boxing.
Caller two, what do you got for me?
Have you heard about this little bot out there, his name is Atom?
Oh, yeah.
My buddies and I saw him the other night, and he dances.
- Did you say "dances"?
- You heard me.
He dances pre-fight with this little kid, and the crowd went nuts for these two.
You put the gimmick aside for a second, and I'm holding here a list of the bots he's beaten.
Chaos. Wall Street. One-Eyed Jack.
Atom's fought them all, beat them all.
This bot is fast!
He escapes shots from these bigger bots, it's insane!
No doubt. I'm telling you, listeners, remember this name:
Atom.
That's right, A-T-O-M.
This bot is one to watch.
- Awesome fight, sir.
- Thanks, thanks.
Great fight.
- You guys put on a good show.
- Thanks.
We'd like to invite you to fight on our card,
Virgin America Spectrum Detroit, Friday night.
Right.
That's a WRB...
That's a League fight.
Damn right it is.
What do you say, fellas?
You ready for the show?
Heck, yeah.
It's the undercard, but it's still a League fight.
I just want you to be relaxed.
I want you to be relaxed.
No freaking out.
Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.
You go freaky-deaky, this whole thing can go south.
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun.
You got to have fun, you understand me?
We've come too far to get out there and freak out and blow this whole thing.
We're going to have fun, and we're going to not freak out!
We're going to stay loose, and we're just going to bam him.
I've spent my whole life waiting to get here.
We're going to...
I tell you what.
Trust me when I say no freaking out.
You got it?
- I got it.
- Good.
You have been invited to Lemkova Suite.
Follow me, please.
What was that?
One more time.
Lemkova Suite.
Zeus Suite.
Sure. Yeah.
Let's head up to the champ's suite.
Sure.
Wow.
- Gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova.
- Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton, and...
And this, of course, is Tak Mashido.
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.
I know you have a very important fight tonight, so I'll get right to it.
It's a little far from the action for my liking.
It's nice. I like it, though.
Very nicely... Wow.
That's a great shot.
Look at that. You want an autograph?
Would you mind?
I'd like to buy your robot.
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus.
And for that I'm willing to pay.
$200,000.
- Done. - He's not for sale.
- Of course he is.
We can definitely... - He's not for sale.
You are 15 minutes away from getting in the ring with Twin Cities, a vicious League bot.
So, to be clear, my offer stands until the starting bell.
OK.
And just to be clear, he's not for sale!
Not now, not ever.
Give me a minute to clear this up, OK?
Tak, how are you?
Max!
Be smart.
I know you love him, but in 20 minutes there may be nothing left to love.
- Think about it. Take the offer.
- You think about it.
Why does she want Atom?
Because he's different from other bots!
Yeah, he's different.
He's smaller, weaker,
- and he's going to get his ass kicked.
- He's a boxer.
We taught him to box.
You taught him to box!
- That's worth something.
- I think it is, too.
I think it's worth 200 grand.
Two hundred grand.
We can go round and round this all night long.
Look at me.
But it's not going to happen.
I got a fight to get to.
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, the march towards the Real Steel Championship makes its way through Detroit's
Virgin America Spectrum!
Kicking off the evening, in our first undercard, the two-headed tyrant,
Twin Cities!
Opposing Twin Cities, in his first professional fight, hailing from parts unknown,
Atom!
- Nice work, boss.
- Thanks.
- Did you switch him to fight mode?
- Of course.
- This bot is tough to put down.
- Atom can do it.
Look over there. You see those geeks with the joysticks and consoles?
They're controlling everything their bot does.
They're monitoring his systems, seeing what he sees, stadium feeds of the fights.
This is not like the underground handheld remote bots we've been fighting.
So what do we do?
We fight smart, we be patient.
And pray.
Seriously, pray.
Ready!
- Ready!
- Hands up.
Fighters ready!
Fight!
Engage.
Slip!
Right!
Lean back.
Right, left!
Cover up!
Duck!
Left roundhouse!
Damn it.
Lean left!
Lean right!
Cover up!
Cover up!
- What's going on in there?
- He's taking too many hits.
Get your hands up!
Get out of that corner!
Move!
He's getting killed in there!
Tell him what to do!
That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
He's got to have a weakness.
Find it!
Wait, wait, wait.
Right shoulder, right shoulder, right shoulder!
He's got a hitch in his shoulder every time he throws that right bomb!
We got him!
See?
Here it comes again!
Duck!
Spin!
Slide left!
Roundhouse!
One, two!
Backstep. Backstep. Backstep.
Come on, Charlie!
Get in there!
Got to get in close where he can't use that size and reach on us!
Left to the body!
Right to the body!
Left to the body!
Yeah, it's working!
Stay downstairs!
Left, right, left!
- These program modes aren't working.
- Left!
Right hook, slip!
Right uppercut!
Left uppercut!
Duck left.
Counter right!
- Get him, Atom!
- Here comes the Charlie Special.
Three-punch combo to the body!
Out! In! Counter!
- Two-one-two!
- Two-one-two.
Stay on him!
Lunging right!
Don't let him go.
Right to the body!
Straight right to the head!
We got a systems crash!
Get him, Atom!
This is not happening, man.
- Put him away, Charlie!
- Spin left!
Spin right!
Finish him!
- Do it!
- Right uppercut!
He's down!
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Five!
Six!
We got him.
Stay down!
He's out! He's out!
Yeah!
Corner!
Corner! Corner.
Victory!
In a time of one minute, 47 seconds of the first round,
Atom has defeat...
I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight!
Our little bot from the junkyard got a shot at a League fight.
How about that?
And the last thing I want to say to a special girl who won't be named,
Farra Lemkova.
That instead of buying my robot, using your money to control this sport...
- That's it!
- I'm not done.
Why not give the littlest guy the biggest shot?
Because I bet if you give him a shot, he'll surprise you!
Wouldn't you like to see a little guy get a shot at the Real Steel Championship?
I challenge Zeus to a fight.
Any time, any place, anywhere!
You name it!
We will be there!
I'm going to get us that fight!
Atom, Atom, Atom...
That was a ballsy move, you challenging Zeus like that.
That's one thing to call it.
A lot of people would like to see that.
- You're damn right they would.
- You listening to this kid?
Jeez!
- Good fight, fellas.
- Thanks, man.
- Look at this.
Let's celebrate.
- Yeah.
- All right, 70-30, right?
- Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.
- That's so right. - That's very funny.
- I told you we shouldn't have sold him.
- OK.
No, no, no.
I remember now.
Who's right?
Say who's right.
Say "Max is right."
All right, all right. All right.
- We're a good team.
- No, no. Max is right.
- We set?
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.
- Charlie boy.
- Ricky, I was just going to call you.
- Oh, yeah.
I actually really was going to call you.
Don't worry about that.
That was a heck of a fight.
Congratulations to both of you.
That was good.
It was an amazing fight. That was a great job, young man.
- Come on, man.
- What?
- You serious?
- You thought I was joking when I said I'd beat you within an inch of your life?
He thought that was a joke.
It wasn't a joke.
I got a kid here.
And I have your money.
We don't have a problem.
I'm sure you do, but I think we know it's about much more than money, don't we?
All right.
What do you want?
You want 25, 30?
You want 30 grand?
- I got the money in cash here.
- Yeah, right.
Let's go!
Max, go! Go, go! Run!
- Run! Come on.
Keep up, keep up!
- Get him now!
Run! Come on!
Get off him! Get off him!
Come here!
Hey, Ricky.
That's his money!
Leave him out of this!
Stop!
Stop!
Take all his money.
Take it all.
Your friend's a real dirt bag, kid.
He's my father!
Well. Looks like a little less than an inch of your life.
Well, buddy, that will teach him.
Just like old times, Charlie boy!
Let's go, boys.
I'm sorry, Max. I'm sorry.
Sorry.
- What are we doing here?
- Max, just...
Is it Farra? She called you, didn't she?
We're going to get the Zeus fight.
It's not the Zeus people.
I've been thinking about all this, and...
Max!
It's so good to see you.
- What is she doing here?
- It's better if you go with her now.
We get beat up, so you call her to come and get me?
He's been beat up.
I told you he couldn't take care of him!
Yeah. I called her.
Look at us. We're a mess.
We're fine.
She can leave!
Atom's fighting good.
We can make the money back.
Charlie, please.
Just...
Charlie, we're doing so good.
Charlie, please, no.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
Please.
Please.
Trust me, kid. It's better this way, all right?
I know you think you know what's right, but you don't.
You're too young. You don't know.
Look at me, trust me.
And legally she has custody, so what can I do?
What can I do?
I don't want your money, Marvin.
Max, we have our own swimming pool and we have a hot tub and a lot of super fun toys to play with.
Do you want to play with them?
It's going to be fun.
What's going on?
He won't even talk to me, so thanks for that, Charlie.
I'm going to wait in the car.
You don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?
You knew from day one what this was.
You decided to take the ride.
You thought me, you, and a little robot from the junk heap were going to ride off into the sunset?
No, you forgot who I was!
You deserve better... than me.
Will you say something, please?
I tried.
What do you want from me?
I want you to fight for me.
That's all I ever wanted.
Don't ask.
So no Max.
It's better this way.
Marv and Debra have money.
Max is set.
Did you not see the way he looked at you?
That's the way I looked at my dad.
Even now I would give anything to have that back.
Your dad was special.
He was in your corner from day one.
Me, come on.
I blew it.
I blew it.
When Max was born I just... freaked out.
But something would have been better than nothing.
I wouldn't know where to start.
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.
- You do.
- No.
You do.
I got to go.
Twelve hundred miles for a kiss.
Worth it. Worth it.
Go get him, Charlie.
You sound like your dad.
Look, I know you think I abandoned you, and I guess I did originally.
Then you sold me.
Charlie.
You have no business being here.
That's true.
You've got full custody.
He's yours.
And I know I've done all kinds of wrong by this kid, but if you'll let me...
I'd just like to do one thing right.
- Where were we?
- You sold me.
Right, yeah, that happened.
- Wait, what?
- Then we had our asses kicked.
And you slept on a shelf in a truck, and it was awful.
- And dangerous.
- Really dangerous.
I mean, I know.
God. I'm sorry.
That's why you came?
To say you're sorry?
No.
I mean, yes. Yes.
But no.
No, I came to tell you that I heard you.
I got it. I'm a little slow, but I got it.
I know you had a bum ride, and I wasn't there and I should have been.
I should have been.
Your mom was...
She was cool, wasn't she?
She was.
She was the coolest.
Yeah, she was.
And I'm sorry about... what happened with her.
And I can't get those years back, Max, but I'm here right now... and if you're up for it, I'm ready to fight.
We got the Zeus fight.
What?
No, no, we didn't.
You got the Zeus fight.
So what do you say, Debra?
Can we do this one last thing?
- One night.
- It's all we need.
We'll probably get our asses kicked, but at least we'll go down swinging.
Yeah? What do you say?
Welcome to New York's Bing Arena and the Real Steel Championship Bout.
Tim, it's the fight we never thought we'd see.
Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion, against the underdog, rising star Atom.
The champ's handlers have agreed to fight outside the circle of well-known League bots, and have decided to give the people a true David versus Goliath spectacle.
Now, Tim, help me out on this. Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?
The greatest robot boxer of all time gives a shot at the belt to a G-2 named Atom?
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido, Team Zeus has lost their minds.
Now, he may look cool as he enters the arena, but he has made no bones about his disdain for this match up.
Our cameras tried to catch up with him earlier this week.
Look at this clip.
Mashido wouldn't even stop to talk to the press, referring only to this fight as an insult to his creation.
Now, Max Kenton, Atom's trainer, did more than just challenge Zeus.
He did so publicly.
The challenge went viral and created a PR nightmare for the champ.
No argument there.
And I think the Zeus camp knows exactly what they're doing.
That they do. Come on.
Giving a shot at the belt to a nobody from nowhere.
This "junkyard dog," if you will.
That's a marketing stunt.
And judging from this crowd, that stunt is working.
We can't win, can we?
We'll see.
As the challenger makes his way into the arena, you can hear the surge of excitement.
Atom has arrived onto the WRB scene with a vengeance, using a style, some would call it human-like, that bot fighting has rarely seen.
Atom and his pint-size trainer step into the ring and the look on Farra Lemkova's face says it all.
Welcome to the bigs, junior!
I'm giving one-to-five odds that Atom don't make it out the first round.
Who wants some?
I'll take some of that action.
Hey, there!
I'll take some of that action.
How's it going... partner?
Partner?
That's great.
How about a hundred K?
Is that funny?
Hundred K says Atom doesn't see round two.
You carrying around that kind of scratch?
- Yeah.
- Hundred K?
Tell you what.
Remember section 101, row C, and you can bring me my money right to my seat.
101, row C? Hundred K?
You heard me, homey.
- Homey?
- Right?
Homeboy!
All right.
Peace out, posse.
Come on, sugar.
Let's go.
- Never beaten.
- It's showtime!
Never threatened.
The king of the ring, the ruler of robots!
Bow down to the mighty Zeus!
Oh, shit!
That was awesome.
Come on, let's go.
Ladies and gentlemen, in a bout scheduled for five rounds for the World Robot Boxing Championship, in the corner to my right, the challenger, Atom!
Showboat!
And in the corner to my left, the undeniable champion of this universe and any other universe known or unknown, the mighty Zeus!
And now, ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for Real Steel!
This is what it's all about!
There's the starting bell and we are underway.
The bots emerge from their corners.
Zeus decks Atom, and he is already down.
On your feet!
Looks like we are in for another Zeus clinic.
Referee Matt Geiger coming in the ring to start the count.
Get up!
Push up!
Stand up!
But look at this.
The little bot's back on his feet to get a second blistering attack from Zeus!
Atom is down for the second time in less than ten seconds.
- He's too strong!
- That's my boy right there!
Get up and get in the game!
Come on!
No, please Atom, get up!
Please!
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Once again, the challenger finds his feet!
Lean back!
Atom's getting pummeled into the corner!
- Get out of there!
- Move!
A demolishing inside shot.
Get your hands up!
Hands up!
Crush that little can!
Get out of the corner!
Kenton desperately trying to command his robot out of that suicide corner.
Get your feet under you!
Good night, sparring bot!
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer, but he's done it again!
Atom is down for the third and possibly final time tonight.
- Stand up!
- Two!
Three!
Atom, get up!
- Get up, Atom.
- Get up, Atom.
- Six!
Seven!
- Get up!
Eight!
Nine!
I don't believe this!
Against all odds, this little bot is on his feet again.
Come on, Atom!
He can't survive this!
- Come on, Charlie!
- Right uppercut!
Atom has landed a punch!
Zeus is stunned as he reels back from an uppercut that he never saw coming!
Advance!
Fade back, counter right!
Fade back, counter right!
Right cross!
Right cross!
Right cross!
Left hook!
- Let's go!
Come on!
- Take him down!
For the first time in his dominant run,
Zeus has met a bot who simply won't back down!
The crowd is going nuts!
Zeus gives it everything he's got as we reach the last 15 seconds of round one!
Zeus corners Atom, going double duty with both fists!
Downtown, uptown, as the clock winds down!
- Hands up, chin down.
- Stay low, stay low!
Only five seconds left, as here comes that piston-packed right of the champ!
There's the bell!
I don't believe it.
Somehow Atom has survived.
We will have a second round.
And the crowd here is thrilled!
He made it!
Yeah!
Corner!
We got to get out of here.
We got to get out of here now!
We got to go this way.
Come on!
OK, you sit down.
- Let's go, homey.
- All right.
I'll be back for you, baby.
Get your hands off me!
Both corners furiously working on their bots.
This crowd came here tonight expecting a massacre, but instead they're getting a war!
- You got it?
- Yeah.
All right. Here we go.
What is happening?
He is fully prepared for all possible contingencies.
He will be fine.
What next?
Round two.
Round two kicks off, and incredibly the challenger, Atom, is giving the champ a run for his money.
Zeus tosses the smaller bot across the ring like a tin can!
Kenton working his bot with a trifecta of straight rights to the champ's dome!
Toe-to-toe they stand, trading deafening blows!
Whatever strategy either corner had cooked up has been destroyed!
Metal bashing metal.
Steel smashing steel.
This is a brawl!
The crowd is on their feet, watching two machines driven to kill each other!
Something has to give, and it does!
Atom goes down again!
Lights out for the junkyard dog who put on a heck of a show here tonight!
And yet again, Atom rises up.
Kenton must have hardwired this bot with the will to go on!
Midway through round four, and Zeus is looking to end this thing right now.
The champ is holding nothing back as he cracks open the hurt locker!
Atom is stumbling around the ring, apparently disoriented and dazed!
- Hands up!
- What's going on?
I think the voice recog is shot!
He's not responding!
Zeus has found yet another gear of violence, drilling Atom's midsection.
No!
Stop!
Do something!
He can't hear me!
But the bell sounds, and once again this little robot has stunned the world!
We're done, Max!
He can't hear me.
This is murder.
We've had enough.
- I'm disabling the voice recognition.
- He can't hear me!
- Yes, but he can see you!
- What?
I'm putting him in shadow mode.
Show him what to do.
Without the voice recognition, he'll move even faster!
No way. No way!
Look at them. They are freaking out!
Rich girl is ripping him a new one over there!
Do you know why?
Because they're scared.
Because Atom can do things no other bot has ever done.
- But I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
Show him what to do.
You have to fight the last round.
Don't ask me. Don't.
Charlie... please.
I beg you.
Are you kidding me with those eyes?
Damn it!
Yes!
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I'm not sure if you're getting this or what, but I know you're in there!
- Kenton.
In or out? - In.
Give me a minute.
I know you can't hear me, but you can see me, so watch me!
Watch... me.
- You know you're talking to a robot.
- I know. Shut up.
Watch me.
An epic battle being waged here tonight, as the fifth and final round gets underway.
Come on, Atom!
Wait a second. Are you seeing this?
Charlie Kenton is shadowboxing just outside the ring!
It looks like Atom has a shadow function.
So, basically, that means Charlie Kenton is fighting the last round of this fight against Zeus.
It doesn't seem to help, because Atom is backed up against the ropes again.
Help him!
Fight back!
Not yet.
Tak Mashido supervising personally as Zeus hammers down, furiously trying to end this thing once and for all.
I got to tell you, folks, the champ looks tired.
This robot seems to be running on empty.
I don't believe it.
Atom is taunting Zeus.
- Switch to turbo!
- He's actually asking for more.
Please do something!
- Not yet.
- That's right, Charlie. Not yet.
Nitrous pistons, now!
He's not going to last much longer!
- Fight back!
- Not yet.
Hang in there!
Atom is riddled with the nitrous-fueled Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!
Atom!
Atom!
Atom!
Atom!
Wait him out, wait him out!
Not yet!
Zeus is slowing down!
The champ's power core is clearly depleted.
Charlie, please!
Hey, kid.
- Now.
- Now!
Get in there!
Knock that little bitch!
Bust him open!
Yeah!
That's right!
Do something!
Move!
Override.
Switching to manual.
In a shocking move, Tak Mashido is manually operating his robot personally!
- Work the body! Get inside him!
- Get him, Atom!
Look at this!
The champ is trying desperately to stay on his feet, but Kenton is relentless, landing blow after blow after blow to the body!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
A huge uppercut by Atom!
Zeus is down!
This little bot has dug deep here tonight and shown something damn near heart!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
He's good!
Zeus gets to his feet, but Kenton has Atom on him again, landing punch after punch!
Tak Mashido and his super bot have no answer.
Zeus pins Atom's left arm, but Kenton is undaunted!
It all comes down to this, folks!
Drop him, Charlie!
Now!
- Kenton is about to drop the champ...
- No!
There's the bell!
Zeus is saved by the bell!
Amazingly, we will go to the judges' cards!
Ladies and gentlemen, after five rounds, we go to the judges' scorecards.
Judge Number One scores the fight 47-48.
Judge Number Two scores the fight 48-46.
And Judge Number Three scores the fight 47-46, for the winner and still World Robot Boxing champion,
Zeus!
Farra Lemkova, you got way more than you bargained for tonight.
Some would say that your bot won the decision but lost the fight.
She looks pissed.
It took a little longer than we thought, but the result is as expected.
We won.
Zeus is still undefeated.
Any comment on the absolutely humiliating near loss your bot suffered tonight?
- Nothing.
- No comment.
Max.
Where's Max?
There he is. Max.
They're already calling your bot "the people's champion."
What do you say to that?
People's champion?
Sounds pretty good to me.
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
I really want you to know...
No, I need you to know.
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.
Wait here. Wait here.
Yes!
Dark Star November, this is Gator 6.
Return to base.
Dark Star November, this is Gator 6.
Return to base.
I took your advice.
It was good advice.
Thank you.
You look pale. Everything okay?
Sean?
Sean?
Hey.
Anyway, listen.
I wanted to tell you.
- God damn it!
- The only reason why I canceled...
He's calling me three times a day.
I hear more from him now than I did when we were together.
What is it with guys?
I gave notice.
- Ticket?
- Notice?
May I see your ticket?
I, uh...
Hey.
Hey.
You're acting a little strange this morning.
- Ticket?
- Are we gonna make up the 10 minutes?
We're gonna try, sir.
Hey, Grandpa, what the heck was the delay back there?
I just punch the tickets, sir.
I should punch your face.
Sean?
Did I do something?
Look, I can see that you think you know me, but I don't know who you are.
My name is Captain Colter Stevens.
I fly helicopters for the U.S. Army in Afghanistan.
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.
Sean, that's...
- Sean?
- Glenbrook Station, next stop.
I feel sick.
- Damn it!
- I'm sorry.
- Let me help you with that.
- No, it's okay.
Glenbrook Station.
Hey, mister!
- Hey!
- Glenbrook Station.
Hey!
You dropped this.
Thanks.
What is that?
Chicago.
Doors are closing.
This is a Chicago-bound train. You okay there, Captain?
Next stop, Chicago.
Union Station.
Did you see that?
You're kind of freaking me out.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Are you all right?
I don't know what's going on.
Talk to me, Sean.
Look, I don't know who Sean is.
And I don't know who you are.
Okay. We'll get off at the next stop.
We'll figure out whatever's going on here, okay?
This doesn't belong to me.
Look at me.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Captain Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Captain Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.
Captain Stevens, do you copy?
Where am I?
You're with Beleaguered Castle.
Are you functional?
I'm dizzy.
Did I just A-lock?
Adjusting your rotation.
Can you report at this time?
What is this?
What is this?
Where...
Who am I talking to?
Captain, report what you saw.
What?
I don't understand.
Where were you before you were talking to me?
There was an explosion.
Coming from where?
Some confusion is perfectly normal at this stage, Captain.
Do you have a visual signal?
Who are you?
You already have that information, Captain.
- I do?
- Recall my name.
We'll rebuild the pattern.
Try to focus.
I...
I was on a mission.
I was flying, and then I woke up on a train.
And now I'm here.
I need to be briefed.
What unit is this?
You're with Beleaguered Castle.
Who?
Stand by for thread one of alpha memory pattern.
What is Beleaguered Castle?
The exercises will assist you.
Memory thread one.
Listen to the following passage.
"Lilly awoke in an evening dress and opera cloak.
"In her hand were five playing cards."
- Is this a joke?
- "They were,
"the queen of spades, four of clubs,
"nine of clubs,
"three of hearts, nine of hearts."
- Is this a Red Flag exercise?
- End of thread one.
Thread two.
The following is a recording of a Western Screech Owl.
End of thread two.
End of pattern.
Acknowledge.
Acknowledge end of pattern.
Stand by to initiate pattern recall.
Go for pattern recall.
Arrange the five playing cards in order of descending value, irrespective of suit.
- Queen, two nines, four and a three.
- That is correct.
The passage I read contained mention of a woman's name.
What was that name?
- Her name was Lilly.
- That is correct.
Recall my name.
Goodwin.
Your name's Goodwin.
That is correct.
Welcome back, Captain.
Ma'am, I need to talk to my father.
Has anybody been notified that I'm stateside?
Who bombed the train, Captain?
What?
Who bombed the train?
A woman kept calling me Sean.
That is incidental.
Think, Captain.
Remember back.
Who bombed the train?
I don't know who bombed the goddamn train.
- Then go back and try again.
- Back where?
You will have eight minutes, same as last time.
No, no, no, no.
No more bullshit sim tests, okay?
I need to know where I am.
What is the location and condition of my crew?
Does anybody know that I'm stateside?
You are obligated to give me this information.
Start with the bomb.
Where is it? What does it look like?
What kind of explosive? How is it detonated?
- Right.
- Find the bomb, and you will find the bomber.
Find the bomb.
Wait, no, I...
I took your advice.
It was good advice.
Thank you.
Okay.
That's good.
And I signed up for an LSAT course.
Next thing you know, I'll be moving to India to find myself.
LSAT.
Know any good gurus?
She got your shoe.
So, what do you think?
Am I on the right track?
It's the same train, but it's different.
Deep.
I hope it's different.
I feel the same way.
What?
- Do I have...
- Bryan.
What is it with guys?
Everything's more beautiful in retrospect.
What is...
This looks so real.
I think it's gonna be really good for me to get as far away from him as possible.
Unbelievable detail.
Ticket?
May I see your ticket?
They wouldn't put the doer in front of me.
- The doer?
- You're the pretty girl.
- Ticket?
- The distraction.
- Distraction?
- Every sim has one.
Are we gonna make up the 10 minutes?
- We are gonna try, sir.
- Are you talking about Bryan?
Hey, Grandpa, what the hell was the delay back there?
- What are you late for?
- What?
You seem concerned about the time.
What are you late for?
I'm on my way to an asshole festival.
I hear you're headlining.
That's funny. What are you, a comedian?
Yeah.
He is a comedian.
Sit down.
Freak.
Fans.
That's the guy.
He came in third on America's Got Talent.
Got cited twice for a DUI.
We talked about him.
- Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Glenbrook Station.
Yeah, but by 1:00 the bridge is gonna be jammed.
Damn it!
I'm sorry.
Just let me get it, okay?
Hey, mister!
Hey!
Hey!
You dropped this.
Thanks.
Doors are closing.
The explosion came from behind me.
- What's with you?
- I don't have time to talk to you right now.
I got time for you.
Next stop, Chicago.
Union Station.
Holy shit.
Goodwin?
You gonna tell me how to disarm this?
Should I...
Unplug it?
Or do you want me to just leave it? Or...
Okay, um...
I'm just gonna leave it.
Okay?
I'll be late.
Ladies and gentlemen, transit security.
- No, you're not.
- Due to a classified security breach,
I need all of you to turn off any personal electronic devices until we pull into the station, okay?
That means laptops, cell phones.
Cell phone, sir?
Cell phone, sir.
Thank you very much.
Pagers, anything electronic.
Thank you.
It's just a precautionary measure.
Nothing to worry about.
So which is it?
Security breach or precautionary measure?
Sir?
Sir.
Is there a problem here, sir?
- I'm in the middle of a very big deal.
- Sean?
- I need you to turn that off.
- Why don't you show me that ID again?
- Sean?
- Turn it off.
- Turn it off.
- What's your problem, asshole?
Hey!
Sean!
What are you doing?
Hey, not a good idea, ma'am.
Not a good idea.
That's not a good idea.
- I think you broke his jaw.
- It's okay.
He's not any more real than you are.
I'm not real?
How about next time you drive to work?
Not gonna be a next time.
Stabilize.
Lower your pulse.
Did you find the bomb?
Yes.
There's hydraulic fluid all over the floor.
It's not a concern, Captain.
- What is...
- Tell me about the bomb.
Where's that man?
I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor.
He looks like he's in charge.
I want to talk to him.
That's irrelevant, Captain.
I want to talk to your commanding officer!
You can talk to him upon completion of your mission.
My mission is in Afghanistan, where my unit is.
I flew two goddamn sorties yesterday!
You've been with us for two months.
Did you ID the bomber?
No.
Where's my unit?
And under whose jurisdiction is this simulation?
Captain, this is not a simulation.
Lives are depending on you.
What lives?
What do you remember about the bomb?
Tell me about the detonator.
No, no, no.
What lives?
What are you talking about?
I need to be briefed.
Sir, I need to give him something.
That's fine.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Get ready to send him back in.
At 7:48 this morning, Central Standard Time, a bomb exploded on a commuter train outside of Chicago, killing everyone on board.
And that's the train that you've been on.
No, no, no.
I'm right here.
You're talking to me right now.
A man named Sean Fentress was on that train.
He, for all intents and purposes, is now you.
Every second spent explaining things puts more innocent civilians at risk.
- This makes no sense.
- The train explosion was the first attack of a series.
There are going to be more.
Now, did you find the bomb?
In the restroom.
Ventilation panel above the sink.
Cell phone detonator.
Are we done?
No, no.
But that's good.
That's very, very good, Captain.
Good.
Our records show that 1,812 calls ended at the moment of the explosion.
Fifty-two of those calls were tethered to the cell tower nearest the train.
So, one of those calls was made by our bomber.
Do you remember a freight train passing by just before the explosion?
- Yes.
- The explosion was timed to engulf the passing freight train, which means the bomber had to be watching both trains when the call was made.
Fifty-two callers.
One of those is our bomber.
I want you to concentrate on the passengers in your car.
Get to know them.
Narrow the suspect pool.
Look for ones who seem quiet or withdrawn.
Who seem nervous.
As always, you will have eight minutes.
Eight minutes and then I blow up again?
Yes.
I need you to discipline yourself on this next pass.
Perform only the tasks that we assign you.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Charge the drivers.
Okay.
Has my father even...
I took your advice.
It was very good advice.
Watch it.
You're kind of quiet today.
Just got a lot on my mind.
Careful.
- So sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
Ticket?
That was very kind of you.
You're very decent.
Thank you.
You're real.
Ticket?
- How's everything today?
- It's good.
- Anything out of the ordinary?
I meant behavior on the train.
Does anything, anybody seem strange to you?
You're a little strange.
How about you? Does anybody look suspicious?
Are you drunk or something?
Come here.
Come here for a second.
Come on.
Think of it as a game.
A game?
Wow.
They're all so utterly normal, Sean.
That's what's so terrifying about them.
Maybe there's a team at work.
The sleeping giant in cahoots with the minister and Denoff there.
Don't forget the sullen college kid. He's the expendable one.
I bet they're all controlled by the conductor.
Standing there all dictatorial.
Demanding tickets.
You're funny.
Damn it.
What about that guy?
Deposition.
What about the woman who's sitting across from him?
Hair appointment.
Every Monday.
You know this.
You talk to these people more than I do.
Right, right.
And the guy behind her, he's late for an audition, right?
That or a court appearance.
- That's the guy that was cited twice for DUI.
- For DUI.
I know.
- Hey, how's the signal in here?
- It's good.
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.
Is teaching not stimulating enough for you anymore, Sherlock?
Now we've slipped into racial profiling land.
Did anyone else come out of that bathroom today?
Well, I saw you coming out of there.
- Me?
- Yes.
- No.
- Glenbrook Station, next stop.
Me?
Hey, mister!
- Hey.
- Hold on.
Hold on a second.
Just hold on a second.
There's gotta be something in here.
- You dropped this.
- Gotta be something in here.
A broken phone?
What is this?
Glenbrook Station.
Christina?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Glenbrook Station.
Hey.
Hey, come with me.
- This isn't our stop.
- No, come on.
Let's take a walk.
- We don't get off here. - I know.
We'll just be spontaneous.
You're kind of freaking me out.
I know this is gonna sound really weird, but I have a really bad feeling about this train, and I think that we should get off.
Okay?
- Just get your stuff. - All aboard.
Doors are closing.
Come on.
Come with me.
So, what now?
Wait for me, right here. I'll be right back.
- Your attention, please.
- Train 7140 to Skokie will be leaving in 15 minutes from track two.
Your attention, please. Train 7140 to Skokie will be leaving in...
Hey.
You ready to get that coffee now?
Sorry, yeah.
Just one more second, okay?
Oh, for God's sake.
Feeling sick?
It's motion sickness.
I get it all the time.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me?
- Are you following me?
- Can I borrow your phone?
No.
I don't have one.
Sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Look, why don't you leave me alone, please.
Or I'll call the police.
With what?
I thought you said you didn't have a phone.
You know, you have no right.
What are you doing?
Give me my bag back!
Are you crazy?
- Where are they?
- Sean?
Get back!
Sean, what are you doing?
Sean, what's going on?
- Sean!
- Where is the phone?
Sean!
Sean!
It wasn't you.
What the hell's wrong with you?
- No!
- Are you insane?
No!
No!
No!
- Where is the phone?
- Stop it!
- Get away from me!
- Where is it?
Get away from me, please!
Sean.
Sean!
Get up!
Sean?
- Shit.
- Sean, listen to me!
Get up!
- Sean!
Sean!
- Give me your hand!
Get off the track!
- Mister, come on!
- Sean, Sean, get up!
Sean!
Sean!
Goodwin?
Goodwin, come in. Do you read me?
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Do you copy?
Please respond.
It's freezing in here.
What's going on?
What was that?
He's in trouble.
I think the oxygen just went out.
Goodwin?
Goodwin!
Find a way to get through to him.
What is it?
What's going on?
It's not the tertiary cooling, either.
Just keep sending strings out.
See if he hooks onto something.
It's hard to say exactly what he's going through.
- Sir?
- Please!
There's not a whole lot we can do from here.
If nothing changes, how much time does he have?
Some.
But not a lot.
There are four principal dialects of Arabic.
Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-Lebanese and North African.
We will now play you portions of each, discussing their differences.
Lilly awoke in an evening dress and opera cloak.
In her hand were five playing cards.
They were the queen of spades, the four of clubs...
Goodwin, you out there?
Goodwin?
Where's Goodwin?
This is Captain Stevens.
Do you copy?
Captain Stevens?
The capsule lost power.
The capsule?
Is that where you are right now, Captain?
In a capsule?
You should know.
Who are you?
Let me get Captain Goodwin.
Get Goodwin.
You invented this thing, right?
- I did.
- Wait.
Are you in command here?
I am.
Were you able to locate the information we need, Captain?
That's a negative, sir.
I was unable to find the bomber, but I did save a passenger on the train.
I got her off safely.
A woman.
Captain?
It's gonna be counterproductive for you to try to save anyone on that train.
They are outside the mission.
But she survived.
And maybe the rest could, too.
She survived, but only inside the source code.
None of them can be saved.
What is the source code?
It's quantum mechanics.
Parabolic calculus.
- It's very complicated.
- Try me.
Fine.
When a light bulb is turned off, there's an after-glow, a lingering, halo-like effect.
Have you seen it?
- Yes.
- Of course.
The brain is like that.
Its electromagnetic field remains charged, just briefly, even after death.
Circuits remain open.
Now, there's another peculiarity about the brain.
It contains a short-term memory track that's approximately eight minutes long.
Like a convenience store security camera that only records the last portion of the day's activity on its hard drive.
Now, in combining these two phenomena, circuitry that remains viable post-mortem and a memory bank that goes back eight minutes, source code enables us to capitalize on the overlap.
Sean Fentress died on that train.
Of all the passengers aboard, he was your best link.
You two share compatibility in terms of gender, body-size, and your synaptic maps.
What happens after the eight minutes?
After?
Nothing. You cease to exist on the train.
You cannot exist inside the source code beyond Fentress's eight minutes.
Source code is not time travel.
Rather, source code is time reassignment.
It gives us access to a parallel reality.
Now, the deaths on that train were a tragedy, but source code empowers us...
No, but I saved one person.
That girl that's always sitting across from me.
I pulled her off the train.
Give me her name.
Christina.
I don't remember her last name.
Her name was Christina Warren.
- Yes.
- She was 28.
- That's her.
- Born in Wilmette, Illinois.
Died this morning on the train.
No, no.
I pulled her off.
She's fine.
No, she isn't.
Believe me.
She is.
Believe me!
She saw me get hit by the express train.
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
- No, no, no, wait.
Sir, we have to send him in.
A second attack is imminent, Dr. Rutledge.
What second attack?
The train was just the beginning, a letter of intent.
What aren't you telling me here?
We have information that downtown Chicago is the next target, and they're planning to detonate a dirty bomb.
Do you have any idea how many people would die if an explosion of that magnitude were to occur in the city?
We're evacuating as we speak.
We have to stop it before it happens. Do you understand?
If you find the bomber, his second attack, the real attack, we think, can be prevented.
We have very little time left.
Out here, the clocks only move in one direction.
Charge the drivers.
On the upper deck of the next carriage, there's a conductor's compartment.
It's a small office containing a strongbox.
Inside is a loaded handgun.
Get to it.
You are authorized to use whatever force necessary.
I took your advice.
It was very good advice.
You're still here.
Of course I am.
Guess what?
You quit your job and you enrolled in an LSAT course.
Good guess.
Soda can.
Coffee spill.
Listen to me.
Don't answer this.
You deserve better than that guy.
Everything looks more beautiful in retrospect, doesn't it?
- Ticket?
- How did you know that was...
- Are we going to make up the 10 minutes?
- We are going to try, sir.
- How well do you know me?
- Hey, Grandpa...
Not that well, apparently.
Do you know me well enough that if I did something that looked a little strange and was maybe even a little bit dangerous, but I told you to trust me anyway, that you could do that?
No.
Wow.
That was honest.
You're beautiful.
You're kind.
And you're painfully honest.
Who are you?
And what did you do with Sean Fentress?
It's the new me.
Glenbrook Station, next stop.
Ticket?
Glenbrook Station.
All right, I don't wanna hurt you.
No, I'm not gonna sit in my seat, all right? He's bleeding. He needs medical attention.
Is it true that you tried to steal a gun out of the train's security box?
Careful, ma'am.
- Damn it!
- What were you thinking?
- Can I borrow your phone?
- No!
You need to go to the hospital, Sean.
- Please, please, let me borrow your phone.
- No! Why do you want my phone?
What would you do if you only had a minute left to live?
I don't know.
I would call my dad.
I would hear his voice, and I'd tell him I was sorry.
Tell me everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Oh, yeah, the gun in the strongbox, that was a really great idea.
Thanks for that.
Did you make any progress?
Can I get access to a phone?
I need to talk to my father.
I will try to work on that soon. Yes. I will try.
Goodwin, how am I doing?
I'm just trying to measure my performance here.
Have you ever gone back in?
Am I doing better than you did?
We are wasting valuable time here.
No, no.
I have never been on the other side of a source code mission.
- I wouldn't be a viable candidate.
- Why not?
CAOC-N.
What is that?
Because the specifications are extremely narrow.
What are they?
Captain, you should have found a suspect by now.
This tactical advantage, this tremendous tool that we've given you, don't squander it thinking.
Do.
Please contact my father for me.
This will stop at some point, Captain.
As soon as you finish the mission.
And you're doing really great.
And this will end.
Now, whoever planted the bomb had to have equipment of some kind.
Some gloves, a screwdriver to get into the overhead vent, flashlight, something.
Check bags and backpacks, briefcases, anything.
So, I took your advice.
- It was very good advice.
- Hey, Grandpa...
- What are you doing?
- I'm just trying to remember something.
- What is that?
- It's a military patch.
Were you in the military?
A friend of mine was.
He was in Afghanistan and he disappeared, and no one's heard from him since.
Do you have the Internet on your phone?
No.
It's just connected to the office by a really long piece of string.
Do you think you can see what you could find on this guy?
- Sure.
- He's just been on my mind a lot lately.
His name is Captain Colter Stevens.
He's in the 17th Airborne.
Okay.
You owe me.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
Why don't I get one for you now?
Okay.
Christina?
I've been having these dreams lately.
Really vivid.
And you've been in them.
Really?
What?
Oh. No.
Not like that. Not that I wouldn't.
I...
It's just...
I'll call you back in a minute, all right?
Yeah.
- Cramming?
- Uh, yeah.
For what?
Psych.
And I got a big test this morning, so I should get back to it.
Can I borrow a pen?
Yeah, sure.
Whoa!
Hey, that's not cool, man!
Hey, your bag is a mess.
What are you doing, man?
Never find what I'm looking for. It's just like my bag.
It's just like my bag.
How about you let the guy have his bag back?
Finish your deal.
Stay out of this, tough guy.
It doesn't end well for you.
Don't do that.
Nothing.
What am I doing?
Jesus.
Dick.
CAOC-N.
- Can you believe that? - Asshole.
Excuse me, ma'am?
Hey, how are you doing? Good morning.
- Do you work at Walter Reed?
- Yeah, I used to.
- I'm in the military.
- You're in the military?
Yeah.
Yeah, I am.
I was wondering...
Then what was going on down there?
Oh, you know, uh...
We were just having a little bit of an argument, actually, about this patch.
Is that what they train you to do? Assault civilians?
No, ma'am, please.
Do any of these letters, they look familiar to you?
Do you know what the "N" stands for?
It's Air Force, and the "N" stands for Nellis.
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.
Thank you.
Can I borrow your phone?
You know what? Actually, I can pay you for it.
I don't even need to borrow it. I can pay you for it. I have $100.
- Just for a couple minutes...
- I don't want your money.
Just bring it back.
All right.
Thank you so much.
Next stop, Chicago,
Union Station.
Post Operator.
- Rutledge, please.
- Please hold.
Name, please?
You tell him Captain Colter Stevens is calling.
- Hold the line.
- All aboard. Doors are closing.
Dr. Rutledge will be on in a moment.
I have to tell you something.
- I know.
I found him.
- Your friend?
- I got him.
Nellis Air Force Base.
Las Vegas.
- No, he's not...
He's dead, Sean.
What?
I'm sorry.
Your friend was killed in action two months ago.
No, you must've gotten the name wrong.
Colter Stevens.
17th Airborne helicopter pilot.
It was on the first site I tried.
His father's name is Donald, right?
This is from last week.
"Donald Stevens will join host, Leonard Watt, to discuss
"the death of his son, Army Captain Colter Stevens, "who died in Afghanistan in February,
"and was honored posthumously with a silver star.
"Also on the broadcast will be Army Sergeant Robert Alvarez,
"whose life was saved by Captain Stevens
"in a fire fight just outside of Kandahar."
I'm sorry.
Captain?
Sean?
Talk to me.
Captain?
Captain Stevens, my name is Captain Colleen Goodwin.
You're with Operation Beleaguered Castle.
You're safe.
Hey, this guy's crashing!
- Captain, just tell me what you see.
- Just look and speak.
I see a card.
That's good.
- Do you copy? - We are taking a lot of RPG fire here.
That's very good.
Am I dead?
A radio listing is saying that I died in a helicopter crash, in country, and my father received a medal for me.
Your condition's not the issue here.
You need to focus on preventing any subsequent attack.
Everything else is irrelevant.
A news report saying that I'm dead is irrelevant?
Until the person or persons who blew up that train are in custody, yes.
Goodwin, one soldier to another, am I dead?
Part of your brain remains activated.
What about the rest of me?
I can see my hands and my feet.
They still move.
They are a manifestation.
They're just your way of making sense of all this.
So, what are you saying? Are you saying that I'm imagining this?
I'm imagining that I'm still alive, that I'm in this capsule?
We have core temp dropping.
Captain, what just happened?
I asked you a question.
The capsule is a manifestation as well.
Where am I?
That's classified.
Fuck you!
Captain, I cannot imagine what you must be feeling right now.
But if we're to prevent a second attack, we need to send you back immediately.
And, Captain, you cannot deviate from the mission while inside the source code, even to investigate your...
Even to investigate what happened to you.
There's only one continuum on this end and it can't be unsettled.
Well, you know what?
I did unsettle it. I called you from the train.
Just before the explosion, so at 7:46 this morning,
- they paged you with a call from me.
- You may have made that call from the train, but I would never receive it here.
It's a different reality, Captain.
If the call even went through, it would be received by a different me entirely.
This may be difficult for you to hear, but you are a hand on a clock, understand?
We set you, you move forward.
We reset you, you move again.
And that represents the entirety of your function here.
You know what? Next time I'll send you a pizza!
I'll see if that makes an impression!
You cannot alter the continuum of this reality from within the source code.
This can't be legal, what you're doing.
In fact, your acquisition by this program as well as the program itself has been reviewed and sanctioned by military court.
Many soldiers would find this preferable to death.
The opportunity to continue serving their country.
Have you spent much time in battle, sir? Huh?
That's immaterial.
Any soldier I've ever served with would say that one death is service enough.
Fine.
You can have that in return for completing this mission.
- Have what?
- I'll give you what you want.
Terminate your service.
Let you die.
This is taking too long.
You've been too easy on him.
No more rest periods.
I am certain we can find other servicemen with wounds similar to yours who would consider being a part of this program an honor.
What?
No, wait, what?
Send him back.
Charge the drivers.
And Captain Stevens, I'd like you to remember that it's not only about you, but it's also about two million real-world Americans.
I do, however, ask that you value theirs.
Your advice.
Hey, Grandpa.
Calm yourself.
You're back.
Did you find the bomber?
There are hundreds of people on that train.
Well, then check them out one by one.
It doesn't matter what you do to them. They're already dead.
Get to that gun, and shoot someone if you have to.
But get us some usable intel.
No, wait!
We have to keep doing this until you find the bomber.
Please.
I'm trying.
I'm trying.
Who is the bomber?
I'm trying.
I'm sorry, Captain.
I know you're exhausted, and we're all frustrated, but we cannot fail.
You can do this.
I can't.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You're a born hero, son.
Even your father thinks so.
Saving people is what you do best.
It was about his third tour.
- I didn't want him to go back.
- Dad?
I just started feeling like he didn't want to come home anymore.
- Dad?
- Like somehow, he couldn't come home.
And he wouldn't talk to me, wouldn't hear me.
Finally he said he just couldn't leave his unit out there without him, and that was that.
Those guys were his family.
I said some things I shouldn't have. I don't know,
I never fully understood him.
And I can't believe he's gone.
Send me back in.
Please don't blow me up again.
Hello?
I know it's you.
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.
I'm gonna find you.
Turn around.
- Hey, there.
- Me?
Why do you look so surprised?
Don't.
Move.
I said move.
Move. Put your bag over there.
- Okay.
- Move over.
- Put the bag over there and move over.
- Okay, okay.
Move over. Move over. Now hand me your phone.
- You're done.
You're done.
- What?
You can't kill anybody anymore.
What?
I don't understand.
You were going to trigger the bomb with your phone.
What?
Dude, I swear I don't know what you're talking about.
Listen, my name's George Troxel.
I'm a software engineer, okay?
- Right.
- I was talking to my wife.
Try it again.
Your call. Dial it again.
Okay.
I'm gonna press redial.
Your phone is gonna ring, and then I'm gonna shoot you.
Shit. I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Hey!
You dropped this.
Wow. Thanks.
Hey!
All aboard. Doors are closing.
Shit!
No!
No!
No!
Wait!
No! Come on!
Stop the train!
Hey!
Hey!
- Derek Frost.
- Yes?
- See this?
- Yes.
- You recognize it?
- No.
Jesus.
How about you give me your wallet?
Okay.
You left it on the train deliberately.
I must have dropped it.
No.
You planted it there, so everybody would think you were dead.
I know it's you.
How do you know so much?
What the hell is that thing?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Slow down! Slow down!
Do you wanna see it?
Very patriotic.
Slowly, slowly!
All right, all right! Back up!
Back up! Back up!
Not many people could build that.
All right.
Where is your next target?
Sean?
Oh, my God!
Sean Fentress?
Teacher.
History.
I don't know you.
I think I killed your girlfriend.
Why?
You messed up my timing.
- Why?
- Oh.
You mean "Why this?"
Because the world is hell.
But we have a chance to start over in the rubble.
But first there has to be rubble.
You're a teacher, you understand.
Christina.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Everything's gonna be okay.
This isn't the end.
Check through there.
I'll go check this way.
- Okay.
- This is Beleaguered Castle.
Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle. Acknowledge transmission.
I have your bomber.
I have his name.
You have the bomber's name?
Derek Frost.
He got into a rented white van in the Glenbrook Station parking lot.
Illinois plates, five, Charlie, Golf, Yankee, eight, four, seven.
Illinois plates, 5CGY847.
All right, let's move.
And Goodwin, there is a radioactive device in the van.
Some kind of bomb.
Thank you, Captain.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, Captain.
You are now off the clock.
About our deal?
I had hoped that you might reconsider that, for the sake of the program.
I have.
I want something else now.
Good.
I still wanna die.
But I want to go back in and I wanna save all those people on that train first.
It doesn't work that way.
It can't.
No, I know.
I know, I know.
I'm not really asking you to believe me, sir.
I'm just...
I'm asking you to have the decency to let me try.
CPD-2, this is AU SWAT-1.
Van is approaching fence gate to the quarry.
Over.
- Roger that, AU SWAT-1.
- Allow the vehicle to enter the quarry road.
We'll stop him about halfway down.
Over.
AU SWAT-2, this is CPD-2.
Block the east end of the road.
Over.
AU SWAT-2, roger that.
We're going to switch now to a live feed from our Chicago affiliate.
The SWAT team is approaching the white van.
The Illinois man has been sought since early this morning.
The door is open and the man is on the ground.
It appears he has surrendered.
Earlier today, the police discovered...
Congratulations, Captain.
Yes, sir, it's a real validation of the program.
A clear window into just how revolutionary source code can be.
We finally have a powerful weapon now in the war on terror.
Congratulations, Captain.
A job well done.
He's not gonna send me back in, is he, Goodwin?
I'm still waiting on an answer.
Are you married, Captain?
Joe?
Why don't you go take a break?
- You deserve to celebrate.
- Sure.
Can I get you something?
No, I'm fine.
Why?
Are you asking me on a date?
Sorry.
Poor taste.
- Are you married? - Hmm?
No.
I am divorced.
Do you think there's an alternate version of you?
A Goodwin who made different choices?
What do you mean?
Like, a you who didn't get married and get divorced.
Or just married someone else.
A woman who took a different fork in the road.
No, I don't, Captain.
What you experienced was a shadow.
It was an afterimage of a victim on a train.
This is real life.
Here.
The one where you're talking to a dead helicopter pilot?
The program wasn't designed to alter the past.
It was designed to affect the future.
And you've done that.
I missed something, Captain.
That train shouldn't have blown up.
There must have been a second detonator, something I couldn't see.
A fail-safe.
It's a computer program, Captain.
The girl on the train, all the others, they're lost.
I'm sorry about that.
I get it.
I get it.
I know. Quantum physics, parabolic calculus.
You're wrong, Goodwin.
You're just plain wrong.
Captain, Christina is dead.
She doesn't have to be, ma'am.
Okay.
I'll ask Rutledge.
I'm asking you,
I'm asking you.
Just...
Send me...
Captain.
It's your choice.
At the end of this source code, I will terminate your life support.
There will be no coming back.
I'm gonna save her, Goodwin.
It was an honor, Captain.
And I thank you for your service.
Good luck.
I took your advice.
You're gonna move to India, and become a guru.
Careful, ma'am.
Yeah, I'm gonna go find myself in the mountains.
Well, maybe you'll have a cup of coffee with me before you go.
Yeah.
I'd like to do that.
Put it to the test.
Good.
Let's do it today.
Let's just skip work.
Bryan can find someone else to assist him.
- You know what?
- What?
I feel really good.
Why?
Because I've been waiting for weeks for you to ask me for coffee.
Ticket?
Okay.
Just give me a couple minutes, okay? And I'll be right back.
Gotta go save the world.
I knew he was a keeper.
Excuse me!
Beautiful day.
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.
Ticket?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Glenbrook Station, next stop.
- You trust the DOD?
- They've got the finances.
Yeah, well, sure.
Look, if we can get the funding, I guarantee we can have at least...
Eight source code projects up and running by the end of the year.
- Really?
That many?
- Maybe more.
You're a real hero, Dr. Rutledge.
Well, thank you.
We did save lives today.
Yes, a true victory for the program.
A great victory for us all.
We'll talk soon.
So? Exciting times.
Let's initialize the memory wipe on SC-1, start crunching the data.
Sir, we told Captain Stevens that we were gonna let him die.
Let him die?
He just saved millions of lives today.
How many other disasters might he avert down the line?
For all we know, he may be the only candidate with which the system works.
So, let's clear his memory and reinitialize source code.
Shall we?
Yes, sir.
Sorry, I just dropped...
Hey, Derek!
This isn't your stop.
Hey, mister!
You dropped this.
Come on back here.
Derek, it's over.
You understand?
Hey.
My name is Derek Frost.
I planted a nuclear device in a white van parked in the Glenbrook Station CCR parking lot.
Right now I'm handcuffed to a pole on the 944 CCR train headed to Chicago Union Station.
I am a sick and pathetic human being.
And I need to be locked away for a very long time.
Okay.
Derek, there's no more burying the world in rubble today.
You mind if I borrow this?
Captain, some of the guys and I are gonna go celebrate.
And...
Do you want me to initiate the memory wipe, Captain?
Hello, Captain.
- Hello?
- Donald Stevens?
Yes?
My name is Sean Fentress.
Who?
I served with your son, Colter.
- Oh, boy.
- It's...
I'm sorry it's taken me so long to call you.
Sometimes it just takes a while to figure out what you want to say. You know?
Don't be too hard on yourself.
I imagine it's not an easy call to make.
How are you doing, sir?
Well, all that came back was some ash.
It's hard to believe that it was him.
How well did you know him?
I was there when he died, sir.
He said that the last time that you guys talked was tough,
and
he wanted to say that he was sorry.
I just want him back.
I loved him so much.
I wish you could have told him that.
He knows it.
You take care, Mr. Stevens.
You okay?
Yeah.
Save the world?
Sort of.
So, where were we?
Getting some coffee.
Dr. Rutledge.
What?
Shit.
- What's so damn hard about it? - I run a business, okay?
Everything moves on time or people get fired.
- Ten minutes.
- Hey, buddy?
Don't sweat the small stuff.
You'll drown.
Thank you for that moment of Zen, but nobody was talking to you.
What, are you selling self-help CDs today?
Why don't you just mind your own business.
Security?
Get me a detachment of MPs here this instant!
Why are you always so bitter, Max?
It's a bitter world we live in, my friend.
What do you want from me?
It doesn't have to be.
I will bet you $100 you can't make all these people on this train laugh.
Actually, you know what? 126 bucks.
Is that your way of making fun of me?
I guess you have a better gig.
Never mind.
No, no.
I'm good.
Easiest money ever.
- Come on.
- Excuse me, people.
One of our fellow passengers has decided to offer me some money to...
What has gotten into you today?
You're like a different person.
- It's the new me.
- I like it.
I am going to prosecute you to the full extent of the law.
Women always mess up my last name.
I was with a girl the other night and she kept calling me "Getoff."
She was like, "Getoff!
Getoff!" I'm like, "No, Denoff, Denoff."
She says, "No, you're fat and you're heavy.
Get off!"
Good?
Twenty seconds.
Make it ten.
Goodwin?
Look at all this.
- What? - Michelle. Barack.
All this life.
Goodwin.
Open this door.
- Why do you keep looking at your watch?
- Christina, what would you do if you knew you had less than a minute to live?
I'd make those seconds count.
I'd kiss you again.
Again? Mmm.
Goodwin, open this goddamn door!
He's done enough, Doctor.
Everything's gonna be okay.
It is a beautiful Monday in Chicago today.
Temperatures expected to reach the lower 60s.
Right now 55 at the lakefront, 54 at Midway, 53 at O'Hare.
He earned that money.
- Yeah, he did.
- He was funny.
- Speaking of which, I have no cash. - Great.
Come here.
I wanna show you something.
- Such a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Yeah.
It is a really perfect day.
Do you believe in fate?
Not really.
I'm more of a dumb luck kind of gal.
- Come here. - Wow.
So what do you wanna do today?
I think we should stay here for a while.
This feels like exactly where we're supposed to be, doesn't it?
- Good morning, Joe.
- Good morning, Captain.
Lilly awoke in an evening dress and an opera cloak.
In her hand were five playing cards.
At some point today, you're gonna hear about a failed terrorist attack on a commuter train near Chicago.
You and I kept that bomb from going off.
An attempted bombing on a CCR train outside Chicago.
But it was thwarted, and the suspect was found on board,
- named Derek Frost.
- Derek Frost.
Captain Goodwin, anything I can help you with?
No, that's fine.
I'll come back later.
Keep an eye out.
One of these days the right crisis is going to rear its head and source code is going to have its moment in the sun.
Yes, sir.
If you're reading this e-mail, then source code works even better than you and Dr. Rutledge imagined.
You thought you were creating eight minutes of a past event, but you're not.
You've created a whole new world.
Goodwin, if I'm right, somewhere at the source code facility you have a Captain Colter Stevens waiting to send on a mission.
Promise me you'll help him.
And when you do, do me a favor.
Tell him everything is gonna be okay.
Where are you?
Come out!
Come out!
Come on out.
I'm coming to get you.
Where are you, you little rascal?
I'm coming to get you.
I'm going to gobble her up when I find her.
I'm going to eat you. I am.
Fergus, no weapons on the table.
Can I shoot an arrow?
Can I? Can I? Can I?
Please? Can I?
Not with that.
Why not use your very own?
Happy birthday, my wee darling!
Now, there's a good girl.
Draw all the way back now to your cheek.
That's right.
Keep both eyes open.
And, loose!
- I missed
- Go and fetch it, then.
A bow, Fergus?
She's a lady.
You!
A will-o'- the-wisp.
They are real.
Merida, come along, sweetheart.
- We're leaving now.
- I saw a wisp.
- I saw a wisp.
- A wisp?
You know, some say that will-o'- the-wisps lead you to your fate.
Aye.
Or an arrow.
Come on, let's be off before we see a dancing Tatty Bogle.
Or a giant having a jigger in the bluebells.
Your father doesn't believe in magic.
Well, he should.
Because it's true.
Mor'du!
Elinor, run!
Sire!
Come on, you!
Some say our destiny is tied to the land as much a pan' of us as we are of it.
Others say fate is woven together like a cloth.
So that one's destiny intertwines with many others.
It's the one thing we search for or fight to change.
Some never find it.
But there are some who are led.
The story of how my father lost his leg to the demon bear Mor'du became legend.
I became a sister to three new brothers.
The princes.
Hamish, Hubert and Harris.
Wee devils, more like.
They get away with murder.
I can never get away with anything.
I'm the princess.
I'm the example.
I've got duties, responsibilities, expectations.
My whole life is planned out, preparing for the day I become...
Well, my mother.
She's in charge of every single day of my life.
"Aye, Robin, Jolly Robin, and thou shalt know of mine. "
Project!
"And thou shalt know of mine!"
You must be understood from anywhere in the room, or it's all for naught.
- This is all for naught.
- I heard that!
From the top.
A princess must be knowledgeable about her kingdom.
She does not doodle.
That's a C, dear.
A princess does not chortle.
Does not stuff her gob!
Rises early.
...Is compassionate patient, cautious, clean.
And above all, a princess strives for...
Well, perfection.
But every once in a while, there's a day when I don't have to be a princess.
No lessons, no expectations.
A day where anything can happen.
A day I can change my fate.
I'm starving.
You hungry too, Angus?
Oats it is, then.
Good day, Princess.
I cannot find the salt.
Where did you put it?
It was over there a minute ago, the last time I looked at it.
And then, out of nowhere, the biggest bear you've ever seen!
His hide littered with the weapons of fallen warriors.
His face scarred with one dead eye.
I drew my sword and...
One swipe, his sword shattered.
Then "chomp"!
Dad's leg was clean off.
Down the monster's throat it went.
That's my favorite part.
Mor'du has never been seen since, and is roaming the wilds waiting his chance of revenge.
Let him return.
I'll finish what I guddled in the first place.
Merida, a princess does not place her weapons on the table.
Mum!
It's just my bow.
A princess should not have weapons in my opinion.
Leave her be.
Princess or not, learning to fight is essential.
Mum?
You'll never guess what I did today.
I climbed the Crone's Tooth, and drank from the Fire Falls.
Fire Falls?
They say only the ancient kings were brave enough to drink the fire.
- What did you do, dear?
- Nothing, Mum.
Hungry, aren't we?
- Mum!
- You'll get dreadful collywobbles.
Oh, Fergus, will you look at your daughter's plate?
So what?
- You great...
- Don't let them lick...
Boys, you're naughty.
Don't just play with your haggis.
How do you know you don't like it, if you won't try it?
That's just a wee sheep's stomach.
It's delicious.
- My lady.
- Thank you, Maudie.
You're getting too big, the two of you.
From the Lords Macintosh, MacGuffin and Dingwall.
Their responses, no doubt.
Aye, aye!
Hey, hey!
Stay out of my food, you greedy mongrels.
Chew on that, you manky dogs!
Fergus?
They've all accepted.
Who's accepted what, Mother?
Boys, you are excused.
Hey!
What did I do now?
Your father has something to discuss with you.
Fergus?
Merida.
The lords are presenting their sons as suitors for your betrothal.
- What?
- The clans have accepted.
- Dad!
- What?
I...
You...
She...
Elinor?
Honestly, Merida, I don't know why you're reacting this way.
This year, each clan will present a suitor to compete in the games for your hand.
I suppose a princess just does what she's told?
A princess does not raise her voice.
Merida, this is what you've been preparing for your whole life.
No, it's what you've been preparing me for my whole life.
I won't go through with it.
You can't make me.
Merida! Merida!
Boys!
Mother.
Suitors?
Marriage?
Once there was an ancient kingdom...
Mum!
Ancient kingdom.
Its name long forgotten, ruled by a wise and fair king who was much beloved.
And when he grew old he divided the kingdom among his four sons, that they should be the pillars on which the peace of the land rested.
But the oldest prince wanted to rule the land for himself.
He followed his own path and the kingdom fell to war, and chaos and ruin.
That's a nice story.
It's not just a story, Merida.
Legends are lessons.
They ring with truths.
Mum.
I would advise you to make your peace with this.
The clans are coming to present their suitors.
- It's not fair.
- Merida.
It's marriage.
It's not the end of the world.
- You're muttering.
- I don't mutter.
Aye, you do.
You mutter, lass, when something's troubling you.
I blame you.
Stubbornness.
It's entirely from your side of the family.
I take it the talk didn't go too well, then?
I don't know what to do.
- Speak to her, dear.
- I do speak to her.
- She just doesn't listen.
- Come on, now.
Pretend I'm Merida.
Speak to me.
What would you say?
I can't do this.
Sure you can.
There, there.
That's my queen.
Right, here we go.
"I don't want to get married. "
"I want to stay single and let my hair flow in the wind"
"as I ride through the glen firing arrows into the sunset. "
Merida, all this work, all the time spent preparing you, schooling you, giving you everything we never had.
I ask you, what do you expect us to do?
Call off the gathering.
Would that kill them?
You're the queen.
You can just tell the lords the princess is not ready for this.
In fact, she might not ever be ready for this, so that's that.
Good day to you.
We'll expect your declarations of war in the morning.
I understand this must all seem unfair.
Even I had reservations when I faced betrothal.
But we can't just run away from who we are.
I don't want my life to be over.
I want my freedom!
But are you willing to pay the price your freedom will cost?
I'm not doing any of this to hurt you.
If you could just try to see what I do, I do out of love.
But it's my life, it's...
I'm just not ready.
I think you'd see, if you could just...
I think I could make you understand if you would just listen.
- ... listen.
I swear, Angus, this isn't going to happen.
Not if I have any say in it.
MacGuffin!
- Dingwall!
- Dingwall!
- Macintosh!
- Macintosh!
You look absolutely beautiful.
I can't breathe.
Shush!
Give us a turn.
I can't move.
It's too tight.
It's perfect.
- Merida?
- Mum?
Just...
Remember to smile.
Aye, they're coming.
Places, everyone.
Places.
I look fine, woman!
Leave me be!
My Lord!
I want to announce the arrival of the lords...
Who goes there?
Who goes there?
Boy!
So, here we are,
- The four clans.
- Aye.
Gathering for the presentation of the suitors. - ... the presentation of the suitors.
Clan Macintosh.
Macintosh!
Your Majesty, I present my heir and scion, who defended our land from the northern invaders, and with his own sword, Stab Blooder, vanquished 1,000 foes.
Macintosh!
Clan MacGuffin!
MacGuffin!
Good Majesty, I present my eldest son, who scuttled the Viking longships and with his bare hands vanquished 2,000 foes.
MacGuffin!
Clan Dingwall.
Dingwall!
I present my only son who was besieged by 10,000 Romans and he took out a whole armada singlehandedly.
With one arm, he was...
With one arm he was steering the ship and with the other he held his mighty sword and struck down a whole attacking fleet.
- Lies!
- What?
I heard that.
Go on.
Say it to my face.
Or are ye scared, simpering jackanapes, afraid to muss your pretty hair?
- At least we have hair.
- And all our teeth.
If he was a wee bit closer...
And we don't hide under bridges, you grumpy old troll.
You want to laugh, huh?
Wee Dingwall!
Get off me!
Nut 'em!
Nut 'em!
That's the way to...
All right.
Shut it!
Now, that's all done.
You've had your go at each other.
Show a little decorum.
And no more fighting.
You want a fresh one?
Crivens, you're fierce.
I didn't start it.
It was...
My lady Queen, I feel terrible. My humblest apologies.
- We mean no disrespect.
- I'm sorry, love, I didn't...
But...
Yes, dear.
Now, where were we?
Yes.
In accordance with our laws, by the rights of our heritage, only the firstborn of each of the great leaders may be presented as champion.
And thus compete for the hand of the Princess of Dun Broch.
To win the fair maiden they must prove their worth by feats of strength or arms in the games.
It is customary that the challenge be determined by the princess herself.
Archery!
Archery.
I choose archery.
Let the games begin!
Pull! Pull!
I'll just take one.
Now, I have told you, you're not allowed...
It's time!
- Archers, to your marks!
- Aye, archers to your marks.
And may the lucky arrow find its target.
Oi!
Get on with it.
I bet he wishes he was tossing cabers.
Or holding up bridges.
At least you hit the target, son.
That's attractive.
- I got it!
- Good arm.
And such lovely flowing locks.
- Fergus.
- What?
Wee lamb.
Come on!
Shoot, boy!
Well done, lad!
Well done.
Feast your eyes!
That's my boy.
Well, that's just grand now, isn't it?
- Guess who's coming to dinner?
- Fergus.
By the way, hope you don't mind being called Lady...
I am Merida.
Firstborn descendant of Clan Dun Broch.
And I'll be shooting for my own hand.
What are you doing?
Merida!
Curse this dress!
Merida, stop this!
Don't you dare loose another arrow.
Merida, I forbid it.
Michty me!
I've just about had enough of you, lass!
- You're the one that wants me to...
- You embarrassed them.
- You embarrassed me.
- I followed the rules.
You don't know what you've done!
- Just don't care how I...
- It'll be fire and sword if it's not set right.
- Just listen!
- I am the Queen!
You listen to me!
This is so unfair!
Unfair?
You're never there for me.
This whole marriage is what you want.
Do you ever bother to ask what I want?
No.
You walk around telling me what to do, what not to do, trying to make me be like you.
Well, I'm not going to be like you.
You're acting like a child.
And you're a beast.
- That's what you are!
- Merida.
- I'll never be like you.
- No, stop that!
I'd rather die than be like you!
Merida, you are a princess, and I expect you to act like one.
Merida! Merida!
Oh, dear.
Oh, no.
What have I done?
Angus!
Come on, Angus.
Angus!
Why would the wisps lead me here?
Look around.
You holler if you see anything you like.
Everything is half off.
- Who are you?
- Just a humble woodcarver.
I don't understand...
See anything you like?
Perhaps a touch of whimsy to brighten any dank chamber?
But the will-o'- the-wisps, they...
This is one of a kind!
I'll make you a deal for this rare prize.
Your broom!
- It was sweeping by itself.
- That's ridiculous.
Wood cannot be imbued with magical properties.
I should know.
I'm a...
Whittler.
Of wood.
How about this conversation starter?
It's made of yew wood.
Tough as stone.
That's stuffed.
- Staring is rude.
- The crow's talking!
That's not all I can do.
- You're a witch!
- Woodcarver.
That's why the wisps led me here.
- Woodcarver!
- You'll change my fate!
- Woodcarver!
- You see, it's my mother.
I'm not a witch!
Too many unsatisfied customers.
If you're not going to buy anything, get out.
- No!
The wisps led me here!
- I don't care!
- Get out! Shoo!
Get!
Be gone with you!
- I'll buy it all.
- What?
What was that?
- Every carving.
Well...
And how are you going to pay for that, sweetie?
With this.
Oh, my, that's lovely, that is.
That would set us up for months.
Every carving and one spell.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
I want a spell to change my mum.
That'll change my fate.
Done!
Where are you going?
There.
What are you doing?
You never conjure where you carve.
Very important.
The last time I did this was for a prince.
Easy on the eyes.
Tight pants.
He demanded I give him the strength of ten men.
And he gave me this for a spell.
A spell that would change his fate.
And did he get what he was after?
Yes.
And made off with an especially attractive mahogany cheese board.
Now, what do I need?
Just a little bit of this.
That'll do.
And now let's see.
What have we here?
Hey!
A cake?
- You don't want it?
- Yes!
I want it.
You're sure if I give this to my mum, it will change my fate?
Trust me.
It'll do the trick, dearie.
Expect delivery of your purchase within a fortnight.
What was that thing about the spell?
Did you say something about the spell?
Mor'du, Mor'du, now the time has come for all of us to slaughter you
Hooray!
Mor'du, Mor'du...
- Merida.
- Mum!
- I've been worried sick.
- You...
You were?
I didn't know where you'd gone or when you'd come back.
I didn't know what to think.
Look at your dress.
Angus threw me.
But I'm not hurt.
Well, you're home now, so that's the end of it.
- Honestly?
- I've pacified the lords for now.
Your father's out there "entertaining" them.
Come taste my blade, you manky bear
For gobbling up my leg
I'll hunt you, then I'll skin you, hang your noggin on a peg...
Of course, we both know a decision still has to be made.
- What's this?
- It's a peace offering.
I made it.
For you.
Special.
You made this for me?
Interesting flavor.
How do you feel?
- What...
What is that?
- Different?
Tart and gamy.
Have you changed your mind at all about the marriage and all that?
That's better.
Now, why don't we go upstairs to the lords and put this whole kerfuffle to rest?
- Mother?
- I'm woozy suddenly.
My head's spinning like a top.
- Mum!
- Suddenly I'm not so well.
How do you feel about the marriage now?
Merida!
Just take me to my room.
All right, that's fine.
That's just fine.
A little to the left.
That's good.
A wee bit to the left.
That's good.
It's good enough.
Now, clear out of there, boys.
I don't want you to spoil my shot.
- What?
- My lady Queen.
We've been waiting patiently.
Milords, I am out of sorts at the moment.
But you shall have your answer.
Presently.
Now, if you'll excuse us.
Elinor, look!
It's Mor'du!
Elinor?
Are you all right, dear?
Fine.
I'm fine.
Go about avenging your leg.
Aye.
You heard her, lads.
I dream about the perfect way to make this devil die.
Just take all the time you need to getting yourself right, Mum.
Then maybe in a bit you might have something new to say on the marriage.
What was in that cake?
Cake.
Mum?
So I'll just tell them the wedding's off, then?
Mum?
Bear!
Mum?
You're...
You're a bear!
Why a bear?
That scaffy witch gave me a gammy spell.
It's not my fault.
I didn't ask her to change you into a bear.
I just wanted her to change you.
Did you hear that?
Something's not right.
There's no point in having a go at me.
The witch is to blame.
Goggly old hag.
Eyes all over the place.
Unbelievable.
I'll get her to fix this.
Why do I always get blamed for everything?
It's just not fair.
Everybody, follow me.
And keep a sharp eye.
Here we go. Another hunt through the castle.
But we haven't had dessert yet.
I have no idea.
Mum, you can't go out there.
Mum!
Wait!
What are you doing?
Dad. The Bear King?
If he so much as sees you, you're dead.
Another one of your entertainments to bore us to death!
And what exactly are we after...
Mum!
...my liege?
Best to humor him.
He is, after all, the King.
He's like a hound with that nose of his.
Mum, wait.
We have to...
Follow me.
Stop.
Stop!
You're covered with fur.
You're not naked.
It's not like anyone's gonna see you.
Now you've done it.
Maudie!
Just calm down, lass.
What is it?
Spit it out, Maudie!
A bear!
I knew it!
Would you just listen to me?
We can't go this way.
You'll be seen.
Quick!
This way!
Mum? Mum?
A witch turned Mum into a bear.
It's not my fault.
We've got to get out of the castle.
I need your help.
All right.
You can have my desserts for two...
Three weeks.
Okay.
Fine. A year.
Did you hear that?
There it goes!
Come on, lads!
There it goes!
Come on, Mum.
Think we should lay a trap?
Try shutting yours!
There he is!
I'm sure it went this way.
You can see my house from here.
It must have sprouted wings.
Was carried away by a giant birdy.
- A dragon, perhaps.
- Bear in the castle!
Doesn't make sense.
It cannot open doors.
He's got big giant paws!
Let's just get inside.
- It's locked.
- Dingwall was the last up.
I propped it open with a stick.
What did you see, Maudie?
Just spit it out, Maudie.
For goodness' sakes, Maudie, would you get a grip?
Maudie, honey, come here!
It's all right!
Come on, Mum.
Quick.
They'll be fine.
Won't you, boys?
Mum, we've got to hurry.
Now, I'll be back soon.
Go on and help yourself to anything you want, as a reward.
Right!
Where are these wisps?
Come out, wisps.
Come on out.
Lead me to the witch's cottage.
I'm here!
Fine. Don't come out now that my mum's watching.
I was standing right here and the wisp appeared right there.
Then a whole trail of them led me off into the forest.
Does she think we're just going to happen upon the witch's cottage?
Mum, I know this place.
The witch's cottage...
It's this way!
Come on!
Hurry!
I can't believe it.
I found it.
No.
She was here.
No, really, she was just here.
Wait.
No.
No, no.
No!
No!
Welcome to the Crafty Carver, home of bear-themed carvings and novelties.
I am completely out of stock at this time.
But if you'd like to enquire about portraits or wedding cake toppers, pour vial one into the cauldron.
If you'd like the menu in Gaelic, vial two.
If you're that red-haired lass, vial three.
To speak with a live homunculus...
Princess, I'm off to the Wickerman Festival in Stornoway and won't be back till spring.
There's one bit I forgot to tell you about the spell.
By the second sunrise, your spell will be permanent, unless you remember these words.
Fate be changed, look inside, mend the bond torn by pride.
"Fate be changed...
Mend the bond. " What does that mean?
One more time.
Fate be changed, look inside, mend the bond torn by pride.
That's it.
Ta-ta.
And thank you for shopping at the Crafty Carver.
No.
No!
Where'd you go?
- Welcome to the Crafty Carver...
- What?
...for all your...
Maybe there's a book of spells. Look around.
We'll need more vials.
I'm off to the Wickerman Festival in Stornoway...
Thank you for visiting.
Have a lovely day.
We'll sort it out tomorrow.
My brave wee lassie, I'm here.
I'll always be right here.
Good morning.
So...
What's all this supposed to be?
What?
Sorry.
I don't speak bear.
Find those by the creek, did you?
They're nightshade berries.
They're poisonous.
Where did you get this water?
It has worms.
Come on.
Breakfast.
Wait.
A princess should not have weapons, in your opinion.
There you go.
Go on.
How do you know you don't like it if you won't try it?
Hey!
Where are you going?
Mum, come back.
Mum, is that you?
Mum?
You changed.
Like you were a...
I mean, like you were a bear on the inside.
A wisp.
Mum!
Stop it!
Mum, no!
Mum...
Jings, crivens, help ma boab.
Mum, I know you're scared, you're tired, you don't understand, but we've got to keep our heads.
Just calm down.
Listen.
They'll show us the way.
Mum, look.
Why did the wisps bring us here?
Whoever they were, they've been gone for a long, long time.
I'm fine, Mum.
Just fine.
It's a throne room.
You suppose this could've been the kingdom in that story you were telling me?
The one with the princes.
One, two, three, four.
The oldest.
Split, like the tapestry.
The spell.
It's happened before.
"Strength of ten men. "
"Fate be changed. "
"Changed his fate. "
Oh, no.
The prince became...
Mor'du.
Mum, we need to get back to the castle.
If we don't hurry, you'll become like Mor'du.
A bear!
A real bear.
Forever!
"Mend the bond torn by pride. "
The witch gave us the answer.
The tapestry.
Mum, do you have a better idea?
That'll do.
No more talk.
No more traditions.
We settle this now!
You're the King.
You decide which one of our sons your daughter will marry.
None of your sons are fit to marry my daughter.
Then our alliance is over!
This means war!
They're gonna murder each other.
You've got to stop them before it's too late.
I know, I know!
But how do we get you through there and up to the tapestry with the lot of them boiling over like that?
- What are you doing, lass?
- It's all right, Dad.
I...
I have...
Well, you see, I...
I have been in conference with the Queen.
- Is that so?
- Aye, it is.
- Well, where is she, then?
- She...
How do we know that this isn't some trick?
- I'd never...
- This is highly irregular.
- What are you playing at?
- Where is the Queen?
We will not stand for any more of this jiggery-pokery.
- That's right.
Let's see her.
- Shut it!
Well, I...
Once there was an ancient kingdom.
What is this?
That kingdom fell into war and chaos and ruin...
We've all heard that tale.
Lost kingdom.
Aye, but it's true.
I know now how one selfish act can turn the fate of a kingdom.
It's just a legend.
Legends are lessons.
They ring with truths.
Our kingdom is young.
Our stories are not yet legend.
But in them, our bond was struck.
Our clans were once enemies.
But when invaders threatened us from the sea, you joined together to defend our lands.
You fought for each other.
You risked everything for each other.
Lord MacGuffin, my dad saved your life, stopping an arrow as you ran to Dingwall's aid.
Aye, and I'll never forget it.
And, Lord Macintosh, you saved my dad when you charged in on heavy horse and held off the advance.
And we all know how Lord Dingwall broke the enemy line.
With a mighty throw of his spear!
I was aiming at you, you big tumshie.
The story of this kingdom is a powerful one.
My dad rallied your forces and you made him your king.
It was an alliance forged in bravery and friendship and it lives to this day.
But I've been selfish.
I tore a great rift in our kingdom.
There's no one to blame but me.
And I know now that I need to amend my mistake and mend our bond.
And so, there is the matter of my betrothal.
I've decided to do what's right and and and break tradition.
My mother, the Queen, feels... in her heart that I that we be free to write our own story follow our hearts and find love in our own time.
That's beautiful.
The Queen and I put the decision to you, my lords.
Might our young people decide for themselves who they will love?
Well, since you've obviously made up your minds about this,
I have one thing to say.
- This is...
- A grand idea!
Give us our own say in choosing our fate.
- What?
- Aye. Why shouldn't we choose?
But she's the princess.
I did not pick her out. It was your idea.
And you...
You feel the same way?
Good?
Well, that settles it.
Let these lads try and win her heart before they win her hand.
If they can.
I say, the wee Dingwall has a fighting chance.
Fine, then.
Seems for once we agree.
It was my idea in the first place.
Just like your mum.
You devil.
Everyone to the cellar!
Let's crack open the King's private reserve to celebrate!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Bring the tiny glasses.
Oh, the tapestry!
Mend the bond...
Mend the bond.
Stitch it up.
This'll change you back.
We just need needle and thread.
Mum?
Mum?
Not now.
No.
Please, not now.
Mum...
Elinor, clear, you'll never guess who just solved our little suitor problem.
Elinor!
It can't be true!
Elinor, answer me, lass!
Elinor!
Merida.
- What?
- Dad, no!
It's not what you think.
- Merida, get back!
- No!
No, Dad!
Don't hurt her!
Get out of here!
Merida!
No!
No!
Mum.
It's all right.
I'm all right.
It's nothing.
It's just a little scratch. Mum!
My liege!
Fergus.
Bear!
Dad!
Count your stars, lass.
It almost had you.
Are you hurt?
It's your wife, Elinor.
Close the gate!
- You're talking nonsense!
- It's the truth!
There was a witch and she gave me a spell.
It's not Mor'du.
Mor'du or not, I'll avenge your mother!
- I'll not risk losing you, too.
- No, Dad!
Just listen to me.
Listen!
You can't!
- It's your wife Elinor!
- Maudie, keep this and don't let her out.
- What about the bear?
- Just stay put.
Come on, you sorry bunch of galoots!
Mum!
No.
No.
Mum.
Maudie.
Maudie!
I need you!
Now!
Oh, no.
Maudie.
Get the key.
Maudie!
Needle and thread. Needle and thread.
Needle and thread.
There he goes!
Needle and thread. Needle and thread.
Needle and thread.
You beauty!
One, two...
Steady, Hamish.
There he goes.
We've got his track!
- Back, back, back!
- Get him!
Angus!
Easy, laddie.
Hubert, Harris, help Hamish.
Watch your blade! You're going to take somebody's arm off!
Aye, we've got you now!
- Give me a hand over here!
- Put your back into it, Dingwall!
I'm doing all the pulling here.
Down you go, you scoundrel.
Done!
- Get back.
That's my mother.
- Are you out of your mind, lass?
Mum, are you hurt?
Merida!
I'll not let you kill my mother.
Boys!
Boys?
- Mor'du!
- Kill it!
You Scoundrel!
Come on!
I'll take you with my bare hands!
Mum!
The second sunrise.
No...
I don't understand.
I...
Oh, Mum, I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.
I did this to you.
To us.
You've always been there for me.
You've never given up on me.
I just want you back.
I want you back, Mummy.
I love you.
Mum!
You're back!
You changed!
Oh, darling, we both have.
Elinor! Elinor!
Oh, dear.
You're back.
She came back to us.
It's a great day for this kingdom.
The curse is broke.
Mum.
Dear?
I'm naked.
Naked as a wee babby.
Don't just stare at me.
Do something!
What the...
Avert your eyes, lads!
Show some respect!
Now that's what I call a wee naked babby!
Merida, Elinor, hurry up.
They're leaving.
- Mum!
- They're off!
Come on!
We've got to wave them off!
Come along!
Goodbye!
All the best!
Fair wind to your sails!
But how did this...
There are those who say fate is something beyond our command, that destiny is not our own.
But I know better.
Our fate lives within us.
You only have to be brave enough to see it.
Delivery.
Sign here, sign here.
Come on, birdbrain.
On December 26th, 2004, the deadliest tsunami on record hit the South East Coast of Asia.
The lives of countless families all over the world changed forever.
This is the true story of one of those families.
Oh, God!
Did you....
- ...
Did you set the alarm before we left?
- Yes, the last thing I did!
No, I was the last one to leave.
I was the last one to leave and I'm sure I didn't set it.
No darling, I was the last one out... and I did, I promise.
- Are you sure?
- Yep!
Okay!
No, no, I was the last one 'cause I went back in.
And that means the alarm is not set.
Cause I didn't set it.
Well, I guess that means that we be coming home to a large bunch of hippies sleeping in our bed.
Well, just like your old college days.
It's just turbulence, Maria.
Please Turn Off Electronic Devices.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to begin our descent to Phuket Airport.
The local time is 1:30 in the afternoon...
What are you doing?
It's time to sit down, we are about to land, darling.
Lucas won't talk to me.
Please fasten your seatbelts and return your seat to the upright position.
Take my seat.
- What did I do?
I didn't do anything.
- You're all right, just sit down and stop worrying.
Buckle up!
Sit down please, madam!
Lucas.
- Lucas.
- What?
!
You know you could try being a bit nicer to your brother, he's just scared.
- So what else is new, everything scares him?
- Buckle!
I wonder who he takes off, though.
KHAOLAK, THAILAND CHRISTMAS EVE
Take your stuff, don't forget any bags.
Have you been to Kalka before?
No, it's our first time.
This is the best holiday season ever.
The Holidays starts to full, but this area, it's really quiet.
Great for families.
The archaistic arch is brand new, which just opened a week ago.
- You'll love it here.
- All right.
I'm sorry, but we made a booking on the third floor, the sea view room.
I know.
We are sorry, that was a mistake.
But we feel... you might like this better.
- Where do you come from?
- Japan.
You don't look Japanese.
No, well, I work for a big company there, and we moved around a lot, you know.
And you, you don't work?
I'm a doctor.
Not practicing right now.
Just taking care of the kids.
I see, you got promoted.
Well, that's nice, isn't it?
- Mom!
- Yes.
- Can I have one of these, please?
- Lucas, if you are thirsty, would you just...
- Use your bottled water.
- Exactly.
- Boys, come and see this.
- Come on.
Look.
- I will hand it,
- Oh!
Isn't it great?
- Dad, can we go swimming there?
- Yeah, we could go swimming, yeah.
Ten, nine eight, seven, six five, four, three two, one!
Go!
Go!
Wow!
Now my name is coming up.
- Is it?
- Is it?
It is going up.
It's going a different way than the others.
Yeah!
Yeah!
- It's catching up.
- Yeah, it's catching up.
Look at that!
It's going up directly.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Ahh!
Here up!
- Wake up!
- What are you doing?
Please help!
- It's Christmas morning.
- Help!
Need some help, please!
I go to my gift place in this way.
- Oh, I need to go outside!
- No, no, no.
- Here I go!
- Wait, wait, wait!
One at a time!
Oh!
Oh, a telescope.
A set complete and over stars in that you can stick on the ceiling.
- The whole moves away.
- I arrange it on top.
- Oh, look!
- Oh, pool scarf!
I love it!
Thank you darling.
I mean Santa Claus.
What about you man?
A ball!
Oh, yeah!
Goal!
I can't get sleep.
- Tomorrow I get lost!
- Yeah.
Sure.
Can we go outside and watch the stars?
We'll get tomorrow.
Just close your eyes and think of something nice.
Mom, would you go play ball with me?
In a minute, darling, play with Lucas.
- I can't believe you, the post list!
- What?
I hide that thing and I forget where I put it.
I am on it just to check in to see if there is a message filled later on in Japan.
Liar.
There should be about text saying that O'Neil should... have been given us two years of extension on this contract.
Which means the two of us are doing the same job.
- That can only really mean one thing.
- They can't fire you.
That would be too expensive.
Don't worry!
Well, I do worry.
Because we can't afford to lose this job, can we?
I can go back to work.
- Maybe it's time.
- In Japan?
No.
Oh, you want to go home?
It's not the worst idea, is it?
Well, you should think about it.
But I'm going to play with the boys now, so...
Here, Dad!
It can't be over ward.
Awful, in our pool.
Catch it!
Oh, no!
Go get it, Lucas!
Come on!
Give me the wallet!
- Lucas!
- Dad!
Lucas!
God!
God!
Mom!
Help!
- Lucas!
- Mom!
Lucas!
- Lucas!
- Mom, help me!
Get me out of danger!
Help!
Mom!
Help!
Mom!
Lucas, stay there.

Mama, help!
Mama, take a look.
Lucas!
Look at that post!
Mama, were you all right?
Lucas!
Wait!

Dad!
Help!
Mom, Mom.
Mom!

Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Stop, Mom!
Stop!
Please.
Never do that to me again, Mom.
- Mom!
Never do that to me again, Mom.
- I'm here.
Perhaps you can be over there.
- Come on!
Come up that tree, that tree over there.
- Yes, yes.
That is perfect.
That is perfect.
Oh, look, please!
Please, don't!
Don't move!
Stay very still.
I was a brave kid mom,...
but I was scared.
I'm scared, too.
Where is everybody?
I don't know, dear!
I don't know.
Mom.
What?
You're bleeding, Mom.
Oh, my God!
Oh!
It's okay.
- I can't see you like this.
- It's okay.
I'm...
Is it?
You go first.
The tree there, the big one.
You think we can climb it?
Okay, let's go.
Dad!
Dad!
Wait!
Did you hear that?
- Mom, there's nothing we can do.
- Wait!
We are almost there.
We have to get the safety.
No, we have to help that poor-
Mom, if another wave catches us down here, we will die.
We have to climb that tree right now.
Come on.
- Where are you?
- Mom, look at you, we need help!
We cannot risk it.
We can't risk it mom. Come on.
Listen.
What if that boy was Simon or Thomas?
What if they needed help?
- You want someone to help them, wouldn't you?
- Simon and Thomas are dead!
Even it's the last thing we do.
Where are you?
Dad!
Look there, Mama, I see.
Are you okay?
Okay, okay.
What's your name?
I'm Lucas, what's your name?
- Daniel.
- Okay, Daniel.
To be up here, we gonna get you out, okay?
Lift him.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Are you okay?
OK!
Are you okay?
It's okay, honey!
Come on!
Just stay here, I'll be back.
- Mom, I'm coming down, give me a second.
- No, I can do it.
- Mom, I'm coming down.
- I can do it, Lucas!
Just stay there, please.
Mom.
Mom.
Thank you.
Thank!
Did you hear that?
Mama, look.
They are coming for us.
Hey, over here!
Hey!
Climb down, Lucas.
Oh, look!
Oh, no!
No, no, no!
Wait!
- Lucas?
- Mom, I'm here.
Thanks!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Oh!
My boy!
I cannot see them, my boys.
My boys.
Lucas!
Lucas!
Do not let them take me anywhere without you.
Don't worry Mom.
I will not leave you alone.
I promise.
All right!
Where is Daniel?
What about Daniel?
Daniel?
Lucas, where is Daniel?
I don't know.
Thanks!
Thank you!
- It's very cold in here.
- It's not cold, Mom.
Mom.
Mom, what's wrong?
I need some antibiotics.
Look in the cupboard.
I can't read the labels.
They're all in Thai.
It got to be labeled.
Oh, look at the side.
- OK!
- Let me look, Lucas.
Oh, thank God!
Oh, thanks!
See that, boy?
I'm all he's got in the world.
Do you understand?
I'm a doctor, too.
I'm bleeding.
You've got to stop it.
Please, I need some antibiotics.
Please help.
- Are you okay?
- I lost my husband and two children.
If something happens to me...
What color is it?
- What?
- My leg.
- Still red?
- Yes, it's still red.
- What does that mean?
- It's good.
As long as it doesn't turn black.
You need to eat something.
Eat it.
- Don't bossy!
- I wonder who I take after.
Hello!
What's your name?
My name is Maria, and this is my son, Lucas.
What's your name?
Hey, give her some tangerine.
She must be starving!
Be careful!
Turn your head to the side, please.
You'll choke if you don't.
Please, please!
She needs help.
Turn her head!
Help her, Lucas, help her!
Mom, are you okay?
Mom, Mom are you okay?
What are you doing?
Mom, are you okay?
Mom, stop it, stop it!
That's enough!
Mom, stop it!
Mom!
Mom, stop it!
Francisca!

They're so busy in here.
You got to go and do something.
Go and help people.
You're good at it.
- What do you want me to do?
- Just something.
Anything.
Will you be alright?
Come on, Lucas!
I'm not going anywhere.
- I promise.
- Okay.
It's your family?

Okay, calm down!

Okay?
Okay?
Okay.

This is my mom's bed!
Get off!

Take it easy, boy!

My mom was here.
And he takes her file.
Look!
You have to come with me.
I will help you.
Okay?
Okay.
What's your name?
- What's your name?
- Lucas Bennett.
Where were you staying?
Staying in... uh...
In, the Orchid beach resort in Khaolak.
Was somebody else traveling with you?
Lucas?
My dad, and my two little brothers.
Do you know what happened to them?
- Is there somebody we could call?
- Uh... uh...
My granddad.
What's his name?
Bryan, but...
But I don't remember his number.
Lucas?
Lucas?
Maria?
Maria?
Lucas?
Lucas?
Maria!
Lucas!
Maria!
Hey man!
You all right?
It seems till I hear me.
I'll be up in a second.
Don't even bother, they are sending trucks to the mountains.
- Just staying on time, alright?
They'll be here soon.
- Yes, I know.
- Can you tell them I'm back?
- Yeah, sure.
Hold on.
Hey boys, your dad is back!
- Dad!
Dad!
- Dad!
- Dad!
- Dad!
Hey!
Out the hallway a helicopter just flew by.
- Did they?
- Yeah!
Mom and Lucas...
Why don't you come down here a minute, Thomas?
What about me?
You stay and see if you can see any more helicopters.
Is that's okay?
- Okay.
- Good boy!
You're almost stepped right.
You got it?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, my God!
I can't find them.
Did you see a lot of dead people?
While I'm a very serious commenter.
- Not mom and Lucas, right?
- No, I didn't see them.
I bumped my feet on the reef, that was really hot.
- Everyone was leaving.
- Sure.
Can we leave yet?
I need you to them...
I need you to do me a favor, Thomas.
It's time everyone going to the mountains, seek to a shelter where it should be safe,
but I can't go with you.
You can't leave us alone again, Dad.
I have to keep looking for them, you see?
- You have to look after Simon.
- No!
No, stay with us, I can't look...
I've never looked after someone before.
- I'm scared.
- I know, I know.
I'm scared too.
But you know, you know, the most scary bit for me...
- When the water hit.
- No.
After that, when I came up, I was on my own.
That was the scariest part.
And then I saw the two of you climbing to the tree in there.
I didn't feel so scared anymore, because I knew I wasn't on my own. You see?
What if Mommy and Lucas are on their own right now...
Imagine how scared they'll be.
- We'll look for those in camps-
- No!
Thomas, you have to look after Simon.
And I'm going to keep looking for them.
Okay?
Okay?
Do you understand?
Hello.
Yeah, I hear you.
I'll be looking for him.
Are you alright?
Have you lost someone?
We're fine.
We just want to get out of here.
Excuse me.
I've been trying to place a call back home.
I wonder if I could use your phone?
It will be very quick.
Look around you man, everybody's needing something right now.
But our battery is almost dead, and we need the phone.
I'll see you in the morning.
Okay?
- You're not you coming?
- No, I'm not coming.
Thomas will take care of you, all right?
Listen to me, you can behave yourselves, okay?
And you need to stay with this group.
And I'm going to be with you just as soon as I can.
Okay?
You gonna behave yourselves.
Okay?
I love you.
- Will you have my boys for me, please?
- Just come with us.
You know it's useless.
I can't stop looking.
I love you.
I'll see you tomorrow, I promise.
I love you.
Maria
Lucas!
Maria!
Lucas!
Oh, no!
No!
Hey man, are you okay?
Get in the car.
We will drive you somewhere safer.
My wife didn't want to come to Thailand for Christmas holidays.
Because of my leg.
I insisted, my little girl, Ginna.
She's just two.
The noise woke me up.
I was alone in the room.
I went out to the terrace and saw the sea coming in land.
It took me five seconds to reach the stairs, but the water was already there.
It was not more than five seconds.
On the bed, I found a note from my wife saying they were at the beach.
- You're at the Orchid, right?
- Yeah.
My whole family was around the swimming-pool when the water hit.
I found my middle son first, Thomas, he was on top of this really tall tree.
It took me forever to convince him to come down, because he was so scared, you know.
And I found my little one, Simon, he was holding on top of a palm tree.
He's only five.
I sent them to the mountains.
You know, so that I can keep looking for my wife and my oldest son.
Toughest choice I ever made.
- Have you called home yet?
- I can't find a phone.
I'm saving my battery, just in case, my family calls.
Please.
Thank you!
I will be very quick, I promise.
- Yes?
- Bryan?
Yes Henry, thank God!
How are you doing?
- Did you hear from anyone yet?
- No Henry, you're the first call.
Is everyone all right?
... Henry?
Maria and Lucas are not here.
What do you mean, not there?
The wave came and swept everyone away.
I found Thomas and Simon, but not Maria and Lucas!
...
I don't know what to do or where to look for them!
Henry.
You have to calm down!
Henry?
Henry?
- I have to go.
Many people need this phone, okay?
- I will call you later.
- Henry?
Sorry, sorry.
Thank you.
- What do you want me to do?
- You can't leave it like that.
- Go on, come on.
- Go on!
Come on man, come on!
Keep call him back.
- Yes, Henry?
- Bryan, it's me again.
Look...
I promise you I won't stop looking until I find them.
OK?
- Okay!
I don't know what to do, because it's nighttime now, but I'll....
I'll look in all hospitals, and I'll look in all shelters find everything OK.
And I'll...
I will find them, I promise you that.
- I'll call you when I do.
- Okay.
- OK!
- OK!
Thank you.
Can I go with you?
- I'm scared.
- Close of your eyes, and think of something nice.
May I sit with you?
How old are you?
Almost seventy-four.
And you?
Seven and a half.
You can't drop me.
- Is he alright?
- Yeah, he'll be alright.
With a blanket on him, he's alright.
You like looking at stars, don't you?
I do, stars like Alaska constellations.
Here, the sky is different.
Some of those stars have been burned out for a long, long time.
Did you know that?
They're dead, aren't they?
They're dead, but once they were so bright...
That their light is still travelling through space.
And we can still see them.
How can you know which one is dead and which is not?
No, you can't.
Impossible!
It's a beautiful mystery, isn't it?
Lucas Bennett, can you come with me?
Sit here.
Your name is Lucas Bennett, is that right?
- Yeah.
- And your mother's name is Maria Bennett?
Is that correct?
We got you to look at those things, please, and see if you recognize any of them?
Have a good look!
Take your time.
- Does anything look familiar?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
Aye!
- You recognize anything?
- I don't think so.
You don't think so?
Lucas?
Could you please come with us?
Mom.
- Where have you been you?
- Where the hell have I been?
Where the hell were you?
You promised me you weren't going anywhere.
I thought you were dead, Mom.
- Sorry.
- I thought you were dead.
We're so sorry.
Someone must have changed her record during surgery.
How is she?
She had surgery on her chest, but she lost a lot of blood.
She was too weak to have her leg operated on.
She has to go back to surgery when she recovers.
But she'll be okay, right?
Nothing.
What next?
Consider...
We should try to get a ride to Kathu Apal Hospital.
- Where are my kids?
- They took them away.
- They didn't let me go with them.
I'm Sorry.
- Where?
I don't know.
- I need to pee.
- You have to wait, Simon.
Mom...
Mom.
Wake up.
Mom, guess who I just saw outside.
My leg.
How is my leg?
Still red.
Please, my mom.
Her wound's looking real bad.
We're doing the best we can.
We are taking your mom to surgery right away.
No, no, five minutes.
Give me five minutes, please.
Please!
OK!
I don't want you to slow down.
These are the names of my little girl Ginna and Kathie, my wife.
She's an American.
- Would you check the list for me?
- Of course.
Please, they told us her daughter could be in Surat Thani.
We already been to this hospital.
We have checked all hospitals.
But this one, please.
Five minutes, please!
Just only five minutes!
OK!
I won't be long. I'll be right back.
Lucas...
Lucas...
Is there anything left in the can?
Alright, I'll get you something.
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
- I need to pee.
- Can you hold it?
No.
Simon, what are you doing?
Hurry up, they're going to leave us here.
What are you doing?
- No luck.
- Sorry.
Sorry, and thanks for waiting.
Thanks!
We go now.
Dad!
It's Lucas!
- Lucas!
Lucas!
- Lucas!
Lucas!
- Lucas!
- Lucas!
- Simon!
Thomas!
- Lucas!
Lucas!
Are you okay?
Lucas!
- Dad!
- Lucas!
Dad!
Dad!
Lucas!
- Dad!
- Lucas!
- Dad!
- Lucas!
Dad!
Dad!
Let's go, no need to wait.
- Mom is here.
- What?
She's very weak.
She said some weird stuff sometimes.
The nurse is going to try operate on her as soon as they can.
Mom, look who's here.
Hey!
Hey, my darling!
Mom.
- Is everyone okay?
- We are all okay.
- I'm gonna die.
- No, no.
Is it okay to take this off?
It is in my cost.
- You came back?
- Yes.
I can rest now.
Maria, what?
What, what darling?
- I'm dying.
- No.
No.
- You're going to be fine.
- Take care of my babies.
Hey, that's not why I came here for.
You're gonna be fine as they're going to take good care of you, OK?
I promise you we are going to be fine.
- Henry.
I'm scared.
- We're gonna be fine.
Henry!
I promise we're going to be okay.
We're taking her for surgery.
We need to take her now.
Okay.
I love you.
You're gonna be okay.
I love you so much.
I love you.
You have to go now.
You know I love you.
I'm sorry, I have to leave your hand...
Lucas, thanks for taking care of mom.
We took care of each other.
Yeah.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
There is something I didn't tell Mom, and I really need her to know.
I have a family too.
I've been saving my strength...
Because I want to see them...
one more time.
No, no.
Oh, do you have to?
- We don't want you to feel any pain.
- I'm afraid to be asleep.
You're in good hands.
Close your eyes and think of something nice.
Think of something nice.
Mom is okay, Lucas.
We're going home.
Mr. Bennett, I'm one of the customer holds for the travel insurance.
We have sent to take care of your family.
There is nothing to worry about now.
In a few hours, we will be at Singapore General Hospital.
Where your wife will receive the best treatment in your living.
These people will take you into a plane.
I'll see you over there.
Have a safe flight.
Where are we going?
They take us to Singapore.
We'll be safe there, OK?
Oh, please take your seat!
We will be taking off shortly.
Okay.
- Can I just...
- Yeah, okay.
One minute.
How are you?
Here, with you.
Mom, guess what?
I saw Daniel again...
He was so happy.
He was in somebody's arms.
I bet it was his dad, Mom.
I'm so proud of you.
I love you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I feel sorry, but you have to have back your seat now.
Fasten seat belts, please.
- I don't want to.
- No? You have to fasten your seatbelt in the plane.
We are at the beach.
It's all right.
Luke, you're up next!
Showtime!
Ladies and gentlemen, feast your eyes on the two-ton metal mesh of madness.
And here he is, folks.
The one, the only, Handsome Luke and the Heartthrobs.
Watch as they defy gravity and centrifugal force at 3Gs.
Watch, as they ride their motorcycles upside down within inches of each other, at speeds you can hardly comprehend.
Come on, everybody, give it up for
Handsome Luke.
Here we go, folks.
Come on, give them a hand.
There they are.
Come on, get 'em goin'.
They're working hard for you.
We know him as Handsome Luke.
There they go, warming 'em up.
Let's hear it. Come on, give them a hand.
Handsome Luke!
I gotta go.
Hey.
Do you remember my name?
Romina.
I like to call you Ro.
What are you doing now?
I gotta go home.
Want me to give you a ride?
Thanks.
You don't wanna talk or anything?
You know, I leave town tomorrow after we pack up.
I'm not gonna be around for another year.
Another year?
Yeah, you wanna get a beer or something?
I got someone, so no.
Just wanted to see you again.
Thanks.
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the one, the only,
Handsome Luke and the Heartthrobs.
Hey.
Is Romina here?
No.
Hold on.
She's working.
Okay.
Do you remember me?
Yes, I remember you.
Who's that guy?
He's yours.
You wanna hold him?
There you go.
His name's Jason.
Hey.
There you go.
Thanks.
Good?
Great.
What are you doing here?
Anything you wanna tell me?
Anything you think I might wanna know before I leave here forever and I never come back?
Let's go outside.
Come on.
You weren't gonna tell me?
It was just a fling, right?
That means you don't gotta tell me?
Just as, like, a common courtesy or...
There might even be a law, you know, you gotta fucking tell somebody.
I haven't heard from you in over a year.
You just took off.
Never called me.
I gotta leave in four hours.
I don't know what to do.
You do whatever you need to do.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna do what I have to do.
I'm going to school.
I take care of Jason.
I work here.
And I have a man.
So that's what I'm doing.
That's my life.
You're busy.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm real busy.
I don't wanna keep you.
Okay.
All right.
When does this pay period end, Jack?
On Friday?
Why?
Because I gotta get paid.
Just pay me for half the week, all right?
I don't give advances out.
I'm not asking for an advance, Jack.
I'm quitting.
You can't quit.
I just did.
Hey.
Hey.
Wow.
You look like a princess.
What are you still doing here?
I stuck around.
This is really not a good time.
No?
No.
I was just gonna take him to the park or maybe see if I could just sit on the porch, just say hi to him.
We're on our way to church.
Going to church?
This is Kofi.
- We need to go.
You should call.
You can't just show up, you know?
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Hey. - Hi.
You live here?
Yup.
This is my house.
How long you in town?
I'm gonna stick around.
What are you looking at?
Really, you gonna do this shit today?
Do what?
By God's gift, through water and the Holy Spirit, we are reborn into everlasting life.
In His goodness, may He continue to pour out His blessings upon these sons and daughters of His.
May He make them faithful members of His holy people.
Jason, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
This child of yours has been enlightened by Christ.
He is to walk always as a child of the light.
God, the father of our Lord, Jesus Christ, has freed you from sin.
We now anoint you with the Chrism of Salvation as Christ was anointed priest, prophet and king.
So may you always live as a member of His body, sharing everlasting life.
Amen.
In the name of this child and the spirit of our common friendship, let us pray together in the words our Lord has given us.
Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
The Almighty God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit bless you.
Amen.
Now, as we receive our new member into our parish, let us all welcome him with great joy.
Ride that thing really good!
Really good!
You ride good, man.
Would you like a ride into town?
Save you some gas, man.
Just passing through?
I'm just settling in.
Where you staying?
Some fucking motel.
Yeah. They are no good around here.
Whole town's gone to shit, man.
So you got a job?
No.
You know your way around an engine?
Yeah.
'Cause I got a shop, repair shop, on Washout Road.
You should come check it out, man.
I could always use a good worker.
All right.
It ain't much.
It's what it is, you know, but it's mine.
No one can kick me out of it.
So, that's the workshop in there.
This is Tula.
I don't get a whole lot of work here, you know?
But if you want, you can look for other jobs or whatever, you know.
If it's not enough for you.
I do everything.
Everything there is to do to a car, I know how to do.
Anything you don't know, I can teach you, you know?
And I got a trailer down here.
Stay there if you want.
Yeah, see? She's shy.
Where is it?
Where's the ball?
There's the trailer.
She get it?
No, she ain't gonna get it, man.
You live out here all alone?
Yeah, I live alone.
Sometimes people come stay for a while, you know.
That's it.
It's not much, but, you know, it's got whatever you need in there.
It must get lonely.
Look, Rob, I don't wanna be ungrateful.
I really appreciate what you're doing for me and shit, but I gotta make more fucking money.
Hey, man, if I could pay you more, I would.
You know, you're good at what you do, man.
Really good.
I could fix up that ol' Mack truck that's sitting there like a goddamn... Well, that's good.
You can go ahead and fix it up, but I don't have the money to pay you.
You know, there are other things that could be done, you know.
Like what?
Well, you could rob a bank.
You're full of shit.
I'm not full of shit.
I've done it four times myself. I stopped 12 years ago because it was getting too hot.
As long as you don't do it too many times, you're fine.
You got a kid, you wanna provide for that kid?
You wanna maybe edge out your competition?
You gotta do that using your skill set, and your skill set...
Very unique.
What do you say?
Go fuck yourself.
Okay.
Well, good luck supporting your family on minimum wage.
He's my son and I should be around him.
I wasn't around my dad, look at the fucking way I turned out.
Look, I wanna take care of you.
I wanna take care of my son.
That's my job.
Let me do my job.
How are you gonna take care of us?
Don't say it like that.
But how are you gonna take care of me?
Don't talk down to me.
It's a question.
I'm not talking down to you.
It's just a question.
I will find a way to do it.
You want a house, I'll get you a house.
You wanna get the fuck out of here, we'll get out of here.
I got that trailer.
I'll get a truck, we'll hit the road.
You pick a place you like, we'll stop.
You don't wanna be there?
"Fuck you," we're outta there.
What about my mom?
She can come.
And what about Kofi?
He can stay.
He can get his own girl and his own kid.
That's every man's right.
That sounds like a nice dream.
Ro...
You can, uh, use this.
If you wanna.
But keep in mind, man, I did four banks with a note.
In other words, you don't need the gun.
I never liked guns, man.
They're vulgar, you know.
But you may wanna take it. I don't know.
Whatever you wanna do.
How do we do it?
Okay. First thing is, we're gonna go in there nice and early.
Just when the doors open, okay?
You're gonna take a look at all the tellers.
Go for the oldest woman you can, right?
Failing that, go to the most meek.
You get her to put the money out on the table.
Why?
So, that way, you can see if there's a dye pack.
You put it in your pocket.
You don't hand anything over to them.
You don't show them the gun.
And you go.
Get on your bike.
I'll be about four blocks away.
Ride it into the truck.
Bam, we're home, we're done, we're rich.
What happens if you get stopped sitting by the side of the road with an open cube truck?
What are you gonna say?
What do you mean, what am I gonna do?
I'm an officer.
"Excuse me, sir, what are you doing with an open cube truck?"
"What are you doing?
Why are you sitting here like this?"
Oh, I'm broken down.
I'm waiting for the, you know, repairs.
Thank you for asking, Officer.
That's a nice touch. Right?
What are you gonna do if you get jock itch and, you know, you're riding 90 miles an hour down the street?
You're gonna keep riding, right?
Yeah?
I mean, we do what we do.
But when we do it together...
Shazam.
I'm just sayin'.
Not since Hall and Oates has there been such a team.
Which one are you?
Oh, I know.
So I gotta be the dark, curly-haired guy?
You gotta be the good-looking one?
I guess that's about right.
This is gonna be good, man.
You're gonna like doing this.
It's the biggest rush of your life.
Everybody who wants to live, put your hands in the fucking air!
Get over here!
Get over here now!
Get the fuck over here!
Get on your knees!
All right. What's your name?
Max.
Max is my little fucking dog.
Everybody get your fucking money and he's gonna go fetch.
Get it out and put it on the table right now!
Get it out!
Pray!
Pray!
Let me hear you fucking pray!
Got that money out, boy?
Go fucking fetch.
Fast!
Get it out.
Put it in that bag.
They're not turning!
How much d'you get?
On, baby. Oh!
Beautiful fucking baby boy!
Are you okay, man? You good?
You did it, man!
You did it!
Yes!
God damn it, we fucking did it!
We fucking did it!
Tell me about him.
What's he like to eat?
He, like, really likes apples.
But I have to kind of chew it up for him.
You chew up his apples?
It sounds gross, but it's not when I'm doing it.
Has he ever had ice cream?
Not yet.
You're fucking kidding me.
He's still a baby.
Bullshit.
What kind of house are you running?
No ice cream?
Why can't he have that?
It's not like he can't have it, he just hasn't had it.
Can I give it to him?
You wanna give him ice cream?
I wanna do something with him that's his first time.
I wanna look in his face when he tries ice cream.
Every time he has ice cream for the rest of his life, he's gonna see my fucking face.
Okay, come on. Come on.
No, he's funny.
Come on.
Wanna hear it on?
It's okay. He cries a lot.
I'm sorry.
Oh, so you want the bike in it, too?
Yeah, just all... You know, so that...
Just capture the mood.
It's a nice bike.
The bike's part of the family.
You want another one?
You sure I should take it when she's crying?
Okay.
That's a good trick.
Five, six, seven... Put that fucking money on the counter.
Give me the real stuff.
Don't give me the fucking fake stuff. - I know what it is.
Let me see you...
Come here.
Come here.
What is this?
What is this?
It's presents.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
It's a crib.
Easy, easy, easy.
Hey, boss, you gotta stay... You're gonna fall off this bed.
There you go.
Your mom's home.
Hi, Mami.
Think she's gonna be mad?
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing?
I got him a crib and some toys.
You know, this is really nice and all, but you gotta get this outta here.
- You can't just show up like this.
- Why? 'Cause this is Kofi's fucking house.
What? Just get it out, please.
He can't be sleeping in a bed.
He's gonna roll out and bust his head open.
He needs a crib.
What's going on?
You okay with this?
I'm talking to you.
You okay with this?
Kofi, it's his father.
In our house?
You okay with him in our house?
What are you doing here, man? Shh-shh.
You're making him cry.
Don't shush me.
You in my house, man.
You need to pack all this shit up and get out the house, man.
I don't know who you think you are, just coming up in our life and changing shit around, but this ain't gonna work.
You gotta lower your voice, man.
Excuse me?
Lower your voice.
Romina, can you step outside, please?
Pack all this shit up and take it out, man.
You're making the baby cry.
You're making the baby cry.
Pick this shit up and get it out the house now, man.
I'm not fucking with you.
Pick up all this shit, man.
Fuck you, man.
Kofi.
Kofi.
Baby!
- Mami!
- Kofi!
Kofi, baby.
Baby.
Get off him.
You're crazy!
You're fucking crazy!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Please, please, please, no, no, no.
Okay.
Call an ambulance. Oh, my God.
Okay.
It's okay.
It's over.
Is your name Luke Glanton?
Yes.
Mr. Glanton, a complaint has been filed.
It alleges assault in the second degree, which is a felony in the state of New York.
When such a complaint is filed, you have the right to an adjournment to obtain a lawyer.
Counselor, do you wish to waive any further reading of the arraignment?
We would, Your Honor, and on behalf of my client, I'd enter a Not Guilty plea.
Given the history that I am aware of, of this defendant, and, as well, the allegations,
I'm going to set bail in the amount of $2,500.
Bail may be posted either in cash or by bail bondsman.
In the meantime, I will issue the temporary order of protection requiring this defendant to refrain from violent, offensive, assaultive or harassing conduct and to remain away from the complainant until further ordered...
There's your money.
Thanks for bailing me out.
I wanna do two in one day.
I wanna do the Trustco on Brandywine.
And when all those fucking pigs are coming after me,
I wanna split out the back, I wanna go down to Rotterdam and I wanna do that First National.
You know something, Luke?
If you ride like lightning, you're gonna crash like thunder.
And I'm not gonna let you bring us both down.
Fuck that. Don't be such a fucking pussy. No, man.
It's over.
Can't do it.
Won't do it.
You made your fucking choice.
Fuck you.
Hey, you know what?
If you go out tonight...
Take the truck.
You'll be less visible.
Last favor I'll do you.
I'm done.
You're fucking done?
Yeah.
You're done?
It's over.
Ro.
Just take this.
Just take it.
Ro, I'm sorry.
I'm a fucking maniac.
Ro, just take it. Ro.
Can I get in the car, please?
Just take this.
You don't love me, you don't like me.
I fucking get it.
I'm a piece of shit.
Okay?
I'm still his father.
I can give him stuff.
I got this for him.
Just give it to him.
Tell him it's from me.
You're never gonna see him again.
Please give that to him.
Hey.
Hey, it's okay.
It's all right.
Open your mouth.
Wider.
You owe me a new bike.
Right?
Yeah.
Where's that bail money?
Give it to me.
I'm sorry.
Fuck.
Fuckin' Christ.
Shit!
Fucking idiot.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Everybody get down on the fucking floor!
You, get up!
Get the fuck up!
Fill up that fucking bag full of money.
Don't look at me! Put your...
No faces!
You!
Get up!
Get up. Get up!
Get the fuck up!
Get that fucking money!
Put that fucking money in there!
Fuck!
Okay, here it comes.
What are you doing!
Throw it over!
- I'm sorry. I was...
Throw it over!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Where's that guy back there, your fucking guy?
Hey, guy!
Get up!
Throw that over, and you better not fuck this up.
Jesus Christ.
This is fucking shit.
Get the fuck down!
Shit. Shit.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

Hey, honey, don't... Don't...
It's all right. It's all right.
Don't do that.

Hey, hey, hey, honey, just...
Not... AL:
Avery.
Hey, honey.

Avery, you got a bad injury.
You gotta take it easy.
It's okay, honey. Just gotta relax, okay?
ALI All right?

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
JENNIFER: It's okay.
Hey, baby. We're all here.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay. You just gotta rest...
You're gonna be in here a couple of days. All right?
That's it.
A couple of days.
Good morning, Mr. Cross.
You feeling up to a couple of visitors?
There's a couple men who wanna speak to you.
Avery.
Hey.
How's our hero?
Chief. How you feeling?
You all right?
I'm good, yeah, yeah.
They taking good care of you?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Sausage and pepper.
Thanks for coming out.
From Sabatiello's.
Oh, how are you?
Bill Killcullen, DA.
Avery Cross. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. Oh, of course.
I know who you are.
I know your father, you know.
Long time now.
I apologize.
No, not at all. He's a great guy.
I wouldn't have expected anything less from his son, but this was above and beyond.
I just did what anybody would do, right?
That's right.
And better.
I don't know about that...
The whole force is pulling for you, man.
Don't you forget that.
They're all outside.
Banners, everything.
What happened to that guy?
That guy's gone.
He's dead. It's over.
That's the way it happens.
Right?
Yeah, but did he leave anybody behind?
That's not... It's not for you to worry about right now.
We got people who are gonna talk to you about that.
There's people talking to his family.
Got rid of another bad guy.
And you're a hero.
All right?
Yeah.
Bill wants to ask you a few questions. Is that all right?
It's just your first impressions, that kind of thing.
- Just what...
- Formality, you know?
Yeah, it's pretty simple.
Yeah.
Sure.
All right, I'll leave you two to get to know each other.
Oh.
All right.
So what happened when you were just outside the door?
Um, I said, "Police, drop your weapon."
Um, "Face down on the ground with your hands spread."
And, uh, nothing.
Nothing, right.
Did you announce yourself again, or not? No.
No, that's all we need to do is make ourselves known, right?
Yeah, but it's sometimes not easy to tell whether they've heard you making yourself known.
You know what I mean?
Anyway, you were yelling. Is that right?
I was making myself known as we were trained, correct.
Okay.
Okay.
Then what?
At that point, I knew that I had to make entry, and I kicked the door down.
Was then.
Was the door locked?
Correct.
And you knew that because...
What do you mean?
You just assumed that the door was locked?
How did I know it was locked?
Is that a trick question?
No. No.
I'm just wondering why you didn't turn the thing.
That's how I knew it was locked.
Did you tell me that?
No.
Okay.
All right, so you kick it in.
Right.
Why are you...
Why'd you come down here?
I'm sorry, why did I come down here? Yeah.
Why wasn't somebody else...
A slow day at the office or...
No.
What happened after that?
What would you like me to tell you?
I just need you to tell me what happened. You do?
I don't want you to misremember so, tomorrow, you're trying to match what you half-thought today.
I only want you to tell me what you saw and what you remember.
I shot the perpetrator, he fell out the window.
I know that.
When did he pull his gun?
Did you shoot him first, or did he shoot first?
Don't fuck with me.
Do the right thing, tell me what the fuck happened.
It was pretty quick.
Who shot first?
His hand comes up, you fire?
His hand comes up, he fires, you fire?
Right.
Like that?
Yeah.
Like pop-pop.
That sounds like he shot first.
Yeah.
Well, it's just a triumphant day for Officer Avery Cross.
He left Ellis Hospital well enough to go home and happy to be alive, with supporters from his Schenectady PD family cheering him on.
His father, State Supreme Court Judge AI Cross, says he's very happy his son is alive today.
There's the life of a cop, the life my son chose.
Twenty-nine-year-old Cross hadn't even been on the force for a full year before he ran head-on into the alleged Moto Bandit.
Pursuing Luke Glanton through the streets of Schenectady after a bank robbery, Glanton ran into a home, then he came face-to-face with Officer Cross.
You okay? Glanton fired at Cross, hitting him in the knee.
Cross fired back, killing Glanton and saving the hostages.
Glanton was a drifter and, at times, a motorcycle stunt rider, and police say he had a very violent past.
The guy had a long track record, you know?
He was a professional criminal.
He moved here last spring, and he hadn't even been here for a full month before he started robbing banks here.
He leaves behind an infant son.
Coming up, Dallas and Denver...
Was it scary, honey?
Happened so fast.
I don't think there was time to be scared.
Scary for me.
I just don't understand why you're doing this.
Nobody does.
Doing what?
What am I doing?
I was speaking with your father and we...
We both agree...
Of course he does.
I'm sorry. I just thought that...
I'm a cop, Jen. I'm a cop. That's it.
There's no... I just thought maybe after this, maybe you would've had enough.
Hey, there's no more to discuss.
That's all. I just thought maybe you would've had enough.
That's it.
Okay?
Baby, you can't expect me not to think that.
You guys just don't get it.
I'm sorry.
We're just worried.
We're just worried about you.
Stop saying that.
That's all.
Stop fucking saying that.
Have you been replaying the incident in your mind?
Not really. Mmm-hmm.
No, I'm trying to put it out of my mind, I think.
Does that work?
Yeah.
You think you're ready to go back to duty?
Yes.
Would you want yourself as a partner?
Absolutely.
What have you been thinking about since the shooting?
Not much, um...
Everything's been so crazy, you know, with the rehabilitation and work and everything at home.
Mmm-hmm. Everything at home?
What's happening at home?
Well, I'm there now, which is much different.
Who's at home with you?
Well, uh, my mother-in-law, uh, my wife and my boy.
So there's, um...
You know, it's been hard on my wife.
It's a shock.
And then, um, it doesn't help that there's a...
But it's okay.
I mean, it's okay.
What do you mean, "it doesn't help that there's a baby around?"
Well, I just mean, with everything that's...
That's going on...
Just trying to...
To get all this in order, uh...
Before I can take care of that.
It's been...
I've just been so busy that it's been hard to, uh...
I have a...
I have a hard time
looking at my son.
And that's something new, since the shooting?
Mmm-hmm.
You know, I saw in the police record that this perp also had a 1-year-old son.
His name is Jason.
Have you been thinking about this?
This? You mean...
The fact that he had a boy?
Yeah.
Do you think you're having a hard time looking at your son because you're thinking about this other little boy that won't have his father?
You expecting someone?
No. You?
Hey! Hi.
Hi.
How you doing?
Hey.
Hey, how's the gimp doing?
Hey, come on in, guys.
No, we're just coming in here to check up on you and see how you're doing.
Hi, how are you, Jen?
I'm good.
How are you, Scotty?
Oh, I'm all right, doing good, better than this guy.
Oh, he's okay.
Come on in. How you doing?
Hey, Pete, how are you? Good.
Good to see you.
Good to see you, too.
Did you ever meet my wife, Jennifer?
No. Hi.
It's a real pleasure to meet you.
Hello.
Hey, how are you?
Know Doc?
Yeah, we've never met, but Avery Cross.
How you doing?
Good. How you doing, pal? That's my wife, Jennifer.
Hey, how are you?
Nice to meet you.
You guys hungry?
No, we're...
We'll just leave you to it.
No, come on in, have some dinner.
No, we didn't come here for dinner.
We got plenty of food.
Come on in.
There you go.
Oh, yeah.
Glad we decided to do this.
Oh, good.
I'm glad you guys came.
Here you go. Thanks.
So how's it feel to have the hero home?
Probably can't wait for him to get back to work, huh?
No, it's great having him home.
I just thank God he's okay, you know?
God bless that.
I think we should toast on that.
- To our hero.
- To hero boy.
- Hero boy.
- There you go.
Glad you're okay.
I've been on the force for 22 years, pulled a trigger maybe three, four times.
You're on for six months, you already got one in the bag.
And he was white.
That's an extra 50.
Oh, better him than me, right?
- Hey, you got that right.
- Absolutely.
You guys have any plans for tonight?
Um...
No, we're just...
This is it.
Yeah?
This is the big plan, having you guys here for dinner.
Would you mind if we stole the hero for a little police work after this?
Tonight?
And we'll have him back by curfew.
I don't know, honey, you should probably rest tonight.
Maybe tomorrow night.
Yeah, we kind of need him tonight.
Is there a problem?
What about your leg, or...
Well, we're not gonna be running.
We'll carry him.
What are you gonna do?
We just wanna introduce him to a bunch of people who really admire him for what he did.
They just wanna congratulate him in person.
Good, yeah, that sounds good.
Leave in about 20 minutes?
Not that we wanna eat and run, but we are on duty.
No, you should go.
That's a great idea.
I'm sure everybody would love to meet you.
Yeah, there you have it.
You're a hero.
I hear a little sarcasm in your voice.
Me?
Yeah.
He is a hero.
Yeah.
He's a hero around here, that's for sure.
You don't mind if we take him then, do you?
Not at all. I think it's a great idea.
Yeah, all right, there you have it.
You're released.
Release the hounds!
Yeah.
Hey, Avery, does she sometimes, like, tuck her balls up, at least at night?
Hey, Pete?
Pete? What?
- Can you pop the trunk?
- Sure it's okay with her?
Scott, you know I'm not on active duty, right?
Yeah, we're aware.
It's a little gift we got going for you. Let's go! Police.
Hi. Romina Gutierrez, please.
That's the woman, right there. Romina.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Officer Deluca. Romina Gutierrez? Yeah.
Yeah, we're here to search your house.
What for?
For evidence.
Evidence for what?
We're looking for the money that Luke Glanton may or may not have given to you.
Yeah, well, we don't have anything that...
You can't just walk in here.
Yeah, I can.
No, you can't.
Why's that?
'Cause it's my house.
Look, you assume that I have a warrant, and I'll assume that your mother has papers, okay?
This won't take long.
- Come on.
- Kofi.
- We're just gonna start upstairs, okay?
- No, no, no, no.
No, no, my baby's upstairs.
My baby's upstairs sleeping. Your baby's...
Yeah, my baby's upstairs sleeping, so, no, we're not gonna start up there.
No, no, no, don't go up there.
Romina, hey, relax, relax, relax.
He can't go up there.
Yeah, he can.
You can go up there if you want. But if we find evidence while you're up there, you're under arrest.
For what?
We've done this a lot of times, okay?
It'll be quiet.
Go on, Scotty.
Be quiet.
How about a cup of coffee?
Yes, yes, yes.
That'd be great.
Is it all right if I go into your living room here?
Yeah, go ahead.
Thanks.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Romina, let's go.
Come on.
What are we doing?
What are we doing here?
Hey, this is crazy.
Wait outside.
I don't want...
No, we gotta go.
This is fucked-up.
Why the fuck are we here?
Let go of my arm, man.
What the fuck are we doing here?
Let go of my arm.
Scott, what the fuck are we doing here?
Shut up.
- How long did you know Luke?
- A couple years.
Did you know he was robbing banks?
No.
You didn't know that at all?
Let me just ask you one more time, because this is what we do.
You have no knowledge to this money?
No.
Officer, I swear to God.
It's not here?
No.
It's not outside?
If I was gonna hide something, I would hide it closest to my heart.
Scott.
Pick him up.
Pick up the baby.
I don't think we should do this.
I don't wanna wake him.
I don't wanna pick him up.
Pick him up.
I'm good.
Put him back and let's go.
What's up?
Yeah, they're clean.
All right-y. We'll get out of your hair.
What do you got there, Scotty? Come on.
Help him out, will you?
Scotty, stop. Stop.
You gotta give me a chance to count it.
You gonna count like that, we're gonna be here till 5:00 in the morning.
How are you gonna count it?
Got a money counter in your asshole?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Fourteen grand.
$14,000.
Well, it's not gonna be an even split because the lion's share's going to our hero.
Consider it unofficial hazard pay.
From us to you.
Enjoy it.
'Cause you're not gonna get it from the department.
Don't spend it all in one place.
Fucking earned that.
Don't forget that.
Not bad, huh?
Not bad for a night's work.
We're gathered here to celebrate a cop who makes other cops proud.
We can all rest a little easier at night now that he's on the path to recovery.
Ladies and gentlemen, Officer Avery Cross.
Thank you.
Thank you, Chief.
Thank you for your support.
When I was in law school, we used to always talk about justice.
We'd have discussions about justice.
That's just what they were...
Discussions.
I joined the police force because I wanted to work alongside the brave men and women who know that some problems can't be solved by talking.
Now, no one wants to be in the situation I found myself in a couple weeks ago.
I certainly wish that it turned out differently.
I'm not gonna lie.
Sometimes I even wish that maybe it wasn't me that was called upon that house that day.
But that's the job.
And I can't think of another line of work that I'd rather be in.
Thank you.
How's it feel?
I'm not sure it's doing much good.
How's the spotlight?
I'm ready for it to end.
Look, don't worry, it will.
You know, the police always put on a big show when something like this happens 'cause the hero card's the only one they have to play.
I'm not really thinking about that, Dad.
I'm just trying to get back to work.
You know, Avery, if you planned this, it couldn't have turned out any better.
But you're not gonna make it work for you in the police department.
I promise you that.
I didn't come here to be lectured, Dad.
You tricked me.
You said the pool would be good for my knee.
Sorry.
You know, I'm not as calculated as you.
You know, my life's not a campaign.
It's much simpler.
Yeah.
Well, for somebody not campaigning, you gave a hell of a speech yesterday.
You certainly had my vote.
Plus, that knee's a goldmine.
No, I mean, a limp goes a long way in politics.
Look at Roosevelt.
I gotta go see the chief.
I gotta go see the chief.
Why? I don't know.
I don't know.
Is it bad news?
Think it'll be bad news?
Gonna be goin' back down up there. Oh, Jesus Christ.
Don't mess your hair up, pretty boy.
Got a call today from DA Killcullen.
Close the door.
The state internal investigation into the shooting of Luke Glanton has been deemed lawful.
Congratulations, Officer.
You can put it behind you, get back to police work.
The question is, can you go back out on patrol anytime soon, and if you could, can you be effective?
I don't think that I can.
That's okay. You know what?
There's a lot of jobs to be done around here that, in ways, and you know that, in ways, are much more important than what happens out on the street.
I'm so glad you said that because, Chief, I've thought a lot about this and I think that I could be best utilized as a lieutenant in charge of special investigations.
There's a lot of restructuring within the division that I've actually formulated...
I can't fucking do that.
Well, yeah, of course you could.
Cross!
Come on. You paid too much for your education to act so stupid, kid.
Well, I think it's the very fact that I do have an education like this that perhaps is the reason why I've thought about how restructuring the unit, the division, can actually benefit you, me...
Cross, I appreciate your ambition, I really do.
And I think...
You know, I think you're gonna be a great cop.
You are a great cop.
You're a hero.
But at this point, right now, you gotta get back to real life, and in real life, you got two choices.
Which are?
You can retire on disability...
I don't wanna do that.
All right, good.
I don't want you to do that either.
Or you could be reassigned at your current rank.
That's it.
You gotta work your way up, man.
Hey, man, heard you were down here.
Hey.
What are you doing?
What are you doing in plain clothes?
You didn't hear?
I made Vice.
Get the fuck outta here.
Yeah, man, I'm actually paired up with Deluca.
That's good.
What do you got for me?
Oh, yeah, couple mutts left this in the back seat of their car.
A leaky substance. All right.
So when are we gonna get together, grab a little bite, you know, talk about some things?
Sounds great.
All right, man.
Page me.
Okay.
Thanks.
What I'm about to ask you is very sensitive.
The only reason why I'm asking is 'cause you're my friend.
I don't know what I can do to help, but, yeah, what do you need?
All right.
Right on.
Deluca and I have been working on this case, all right?
And I want you to keep this to yourself.
It's a little private.
And I don't want anybody to know about it, okay?
Okay.
Okay, Deluca and I are working with this fucking hooker.
We gotta fucking head her off with some coke.
So Deluca and I thought that, you know, if...
We need some temporary access to the evidence room.
We need you to get some shit.
We gotta hit this bitch off.
That's what we need.
I really tried to look out for you with that seven grand.
Now I need you to look out for me.
I'm serious, bro.
This is how it works.
Hey.
Hey, don't worry, it's okay.
I didn't mean to startle you.
It's okay.
I just wanna give you something.
All right?
Listen, this is the money that we recovered from your house, okay?
I want you to have it.
I don't know what that is.
You don't have to ever even see me again, just take the money.
I'm not here as a police officer, I'm here as a regular guy.
Listen, listen, listen.
Listen to me.
Get the fuck away.
You fucked up my son's life, therefore you fucked up my life!
Get the fuck away from me.
I should have brought this to you sooner, and I apologize.
This was recovered from a house during a search.
No, wait a minute, Cross.
It's just a small fraction of what's going on.
Wait a minute, Cross.
Don't say another word.
What do you mean?
No, no, no, don't say another word.
What do you expect me to do with this?
You're joking, right?
This is shit.
Chief.
This ain't my problem, all right?
This is your problem.
This is our problem of the fucking police department, and I'm bringing it to your attention because that's what I should fucking do!
Oh, yeah, is that right?
Yeah!
Is that what you should do?
Rat out other fucking cops?
Chief...
This is un-fucking-believable, all right?
Get this shit out of here!
Fuck.
Hey.
Where you going?
I was going home.
You know that thing you and Scotty been talking about?
Yeah.
Sure.
Well, you and I have to talk about it.
Follow me.
Hey!
Hey, Pop.
Avery.
There's a way out of this.
You're not gonna like it.
You wanna hear?
Yeah, I wanna hear it.
Let's start with the precinct.
Anybody there still trust you?
Scott.
We'll start with Scott.
Playing shortstop.
Looks good.
He's getting bigger.
Jesus Christ.
You really gave Deluca quite a scare. He's ready to dump you, the whole thing.
Enough with these fucking tests, all right?
Either ask me to help you or just leave me the fuck alone.
I need you to go into the locker,
I need you to take the McKillen case out.
It's a kilo, it's a big brick, it says "McKillen" across it, okay?
I need you to break off a chunk, I need you to put it in a bag.
I'm gonna come by, I'm gonna pick it up tomorrow morning.
If somebody asks you, "Hey, why is this lighter?"
You say, "Hey, you know what?" "I'm a rookie.
I made a mistake."
You're a squeaky-clean fucking lawyer with a medal of honor.
Nobody's gonna question you, okay?
You gotta do this for me.
I'm in a jam with these guys.
No problem.
I knew I could count on you, man.
Yeah.
Tell Mike I love him. I gotta go.
All right.
I need you to go into the locker,
I need you to take the McKillen case out.
It's a kilo, it's a big brick, it says "McKillen" across it, okay?
I need you to break off a chunk, I need you to put it in a bag.
I'm gonna come by, I'm gonna pick it up tomorrow morning.
All right?
If somebody asks you, "Hey, why is this lighter?"
You say, "Hey, you know what?" "I'm a rookie.
I made a mistake."
You're a squeaky-clean fucking lawyer with a medal of honor.
Nobody's gonna question you, okay?
You gotta do this for me.
I'm in a jam with these guys.
No problem.
You shown this to IA?
'Course not.
Handing it to you on a silver platter.
Got any idea what this means?
Are you ready to do it?
Are you, son?
Are you really ready?
'Cause they're gonna fuckin' tear you in half.
I'm gonna need your assurance you're gonna follow through with it.
Really?
And I'm gonna want full immunity when you do.
You can't just walk in here and tell me what the fuck to do. You understand?
And when you do,
I wanna be made Assistant District Attorney.
I have a law degree and I passed the bar.
I don't have a spot for you right now.
Make a spot.
I won't do that.
I can't just snap my fingers and make you Assistant DA.
You can say no.
You can say no, I'll walk out this door,
I'll walk over to the Gazette,
I'll tell 'em everything I know, including this conversation.
Listen, you're not going anywhere.
Don't... Listen.
Put it back on the table, I'll fucking do it.
All three things?
All right.
I'm not gonna promise you how long you're gonna stay there.
You're not gonna shake my fucking hand, pal.
I'll make you Assistant DA.
I'm never gonna shake your fucking hand.
You're too smart for your own good.
Get right in there for a good shot.
Detective, how do you respond to these allegations?
Drugs, corruption and gangs.
It's not an investigation by the Schenectady Police Department, it's an investigation into the Schenectady Police Department.
Earlier today, DA William Killcullen announced that his office, along with the FBI, would be handing down indictments that would lead to the arrest of these Schenectady police officers.
The DA is making allegations today that the Vice officers were acting like the gangs that they were supposed to be busting.
Officers allegedly stole drugs and money, even guns from inside the evidence room here.
Officials say that, with that stolen evidence, the cops paid criminals to help set up their rivals, which then led to those headline-grabbing arrests.
The DA announced its star witness in the case today, hero cop Avery Cross, who, less than a year ago, was shot in the line of duty while trying to save two Schenectady residents from the alleged Moto Bandit.
In Schenectady, I'm Jessica Layton, News Channel 13. - It's gonna be all right.
- Thanks, Jess.
It's the largest case of fraud this region has seen...
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to look at my dad dressed in judge's robes and I used to think that my father was a superhero.
And I don't think I was far off.
He had that quality that judges have where they have tremendous compassion, but they're also ferocious at the same time.
He wasn't afraid of making enemies.
I think that's probably why he had so many friends.
I had the chance, right before he fell into the coma, to tell him that I was dedicating my run for Attorney General to him.
He shook his head, "No," and I didn't understand why.
So I leaned in close, and... He could whisper. And he said to me,
"I'll take the win, not the run."
That was my dad, that was AI.
Son, you wanna come with me?
Sure.
Avery?
Yeah.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure.
Close the door.
What's wrong?
We have to talk about AJ.
He wants to come and live with you.
He won't stop asking me about it.
Really?
I guess that's a good idea at some point.
I think, if he doesn't come and live with you, he's gonna completely go off the rails.
It's just right now, you know, with the campaign and everything, it's just not an ideal time.
I mean, what am I gonna do with him? I don't know what he likes.
I just don't think it would be good for him or anybody.
I mean, come on, you know that.
Okay.
No, well, you can tell him that.
Jennifer...
What am I supposed to tell him?
I just don't...
Why are you doing this right now?
You can tell him now.
Tomorrow we're gonna head to Buffalo in the morning.
Wednesday is outer boroughs in New York City, and then the AI Smith dinner at night.
Do we have time to get there?
We do, absolutely.
We'll have our last event close in Queens, we'll hit the Upper West Side and then we have to be at the Waldorf.
How about Yusef, the driver we had for my dad?
Can we get Yusef? Yeah, totally.
What's going on in Queens?
In Queens, he's gonna do an event on environmental issues.
Yeah.
Talking about some of the...
Protecting the Sound, and some of the environmental stuff.
And then Thursday head to Rochester for lunch.
You're gonna go to a place where you're gonna order something called the Garbage Plate.
Just want you to be prepared for it.
We're gonna do that... Did you see?
Yeah, no, I've seen it.
And then Sunday morning, black churches.
Oh, perfect.
Avery Cross?
Yeah.
AJ.
AJ?
Hi, AJ.
Yeah.
So what high school are you coming from?
Troy High School. Yeah.
You're coming from Troy?
Okay.
So not too far away.
What brings you to Schenectady?
Uh, my dad wanted me here.
Your dad wanted you here?
Yeah, for my senior year, he wanted me to move here.
What about you?
Did you wanna come here for your senior year?
I don't know.
Yeah.
I...
I guess not, not really.
Do you know anybody here? At the high school?
No.
No. Don't know anybody?
Just peek over your shoulder.
Peek over your fucking shoulder.
There.
Hello. Hello.
Hello.
You don't like them girls?
I don't know, maybe you're just used to it.
They ain't got girls like that where I come from.
Where are you from?
Troy.
Troy?
Yeah, you heard of Troy?
Yeah, I've heard of Troy.
Where's Troy at?
It's fucking right next door, dude.
Right next door?
I would've guessed you were from Long Island.
Where's that?
It's where people that talk like you come from.
B, I'm bored as a motherfucker around here, dude.
I've been here for, like, fucking three days,
I'm bored out of my fucking mind.
Welcome to Schenectady.
What do you dudes do for fun, nothing?
This is it?
This is what I got, for a year?
No, we got some things. What?
Don't say, like, a mall.
If you say a fucking mall, B, like, I swear to God...
What do you do?
I get high.
We do some of that around here.
I could tell you smoked.
I seen you from back there.
You one of them loner...
Loner-stoners is what I call 'em, right?
You like to get high and, like, chill in your room and draw and shit.
So what you trying to do with the rest of this day, then?
You trying to go to math class?
You wanna go get high?
Let's go.
All right, let's go.
You know what this remind me of?
The Goonies.
You know that movie?
Where they're, like, all in a cave?
You want a cigarette, just ask, don't worry.
I'll take a cigarette.
I like smoking cigarettes when I'm high.
You like smoking when you're smoking?
You smoke menthols, man?
Like a breath of fresh air.
Like a breath of fresh air. But you don't care.
You got the smoke puff blowing everywhere, I swear.
Yo, here we go, I said my spit is my MO.
My mouth is my gun, I shoot up your whole squadron with one flip of my tongue.
When did you write that?
No, I'm not trying to lie.
I wrote that.
Fucking quiet around here.
Shit, though, when I was a kid, there were always kids playing here, you know?
Oh, you came here when you was a kid?
Yeah, man, I'd come here with my parents sometimes.
Are your parents still together?
Yeah.
That's cool, they're still together.
Yeah, it's all right.
It's not my real dad, though.
Where's your real dad at?
Oh, he died, actually, like in a car accident or something.
Shit.
Yeah, this is kind bud, dude.
But you know where I could score some X?
Yeah.
For tonight?
Well, we just did our downer, we gotta get up.
Remember, come back by yourself.
All right?
Yeah, man, you got it.
Let's go.
Let me see it.
What?
Let me see the fucking drugs.
You fucking crazy, man?
Let me see my fucking drugs.
What the fuck?
I gave you $500.
Yeah, that's 20 hits.
Yo, that's inflation in Scheneck, right?
Oh, yo, what the fuck, son?
Dead ass, the fucking 5-0. Don't worry about it, man.
Oh, fuck!
Fuck!
Police. Let me see your hands.
Police!
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!
All right!
Fuck!
Interlace your fingers.
He was buying ecstasy from a Schenectady kid.
And who arrested him?
A couple of beat cops.
McCracken and Potter.
You know these guys? Mmm-hmm.
They'll sit on it if I ask them to.
Did anybody else see him come in? No.
I made sure of that.
Did you get any sense that he knew this kid or...
Yeah, friends.
- Just the two of 'em?
- Yeah.
What's this other kid's name?
Jason Kancam.
Got busted a few years ago for shoplifting.
- What's his name?
- Jason Kancam.
Gordon, can we kill the mic on Room 3?
Yeah.
Dad, I fucked up.
I know...
And I know you don't have time to deal with this stuff right now.
Not him, okay?
What?
I want you to leave him alone.
All right?
Okay?
Why?
Wipe that fucking smirk off your face!
You hear me?
I want you to leave that fucking kid alone, all right?
Look at me.
Look at me.
You wanted to come live with me, right?
You think this is easy for me, during this time, huh?
I'm trying to make this work.
I'm doing it for you.
You can have anything you want, but I don't want you to touch that kid.
You leave him alone.
Do you under-fucking-stand me?
Say yes.
Yes.
Look at me and say yes.
Yes.
Can you state your name for the record?
Jason Kancam.
Jason, how old are you?
Seventeen.
Are your parents here today?
Yes.
Yes.
Can you come up, please?
You're Jason's parents?
Yes.
Jason, you've been charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Counselor, do you waive a formal reading of the charges?
Yes, please, Your Honor.
In regards to my client's status, there has been a discussion with the District Attorney.
Your Honor, I may be able to have this case potentially resolved today.
So I'd ask that the court put it on for second call.
Second call.
This is a C felony, so Jason could do anywhere between five and 15 years.
But I'm getting the impression from the prosecutor that they may be willing to reduce it today to a misdemeanor.
The offer on his particular case would be time served, which is the day he spent in jail, and a fine, and that would be it.
Can he come home with us today?
He can.
Guess it's your lucky day.
Somebody's looking out for you.
Look, I didn't mean to get you busted the other night, all right?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, it was a pretty shitty fucking night.
But don't worry about it.
I was out of there in five fucking minutes, dude.
You think I'm gonna sit there and get fucked up the ass all night?
And what happened when you got home?
Huh?
Went upstairs.
Tried to go to sleep, but I was still trippin' like a mo'fucker.
Why, what happened to you when you got home?
I'm cool, man.
Your moms was all worried and shit?
Oh, man, my mom's...
I'm cool, man.
Really?
'Cause I saw that guy today.
What guy?
Your dad.
That's your fucking dad.
When did he move in?
What the fuck you talking about, AJ?
Just wanna know.
I figured out...
What the fuck's your problem?
What the fuck's your problem?
Chill, dude.
Chill.
What's your problem, AJ?
Just fucking around.
Don't be so serious.
You got a fucking temper, B.
You need to watch that shit.
It's gonna get you into fucking trouble.
How was school, Vanessa?
It was okay.
I had trouble with math.
Hey, what's the deal with my dad?
What?
What, did you like really hate him or something?
What was his name?
I'm not doing this.
What was his first name?
I'm not doing this.
How come Mom never talks to me about my dad?
I'm your father.
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.
It's her business to talk about it, not talk about it, you know?
Grandma used to tell me some.
Yeah?
What did she used to say?
She said, like...
Just that he was, like, an outlaw.
You know?
Sound cool to you?
I don't know.
He's not your father.
Not really.
Just some guy with a baby.
I'm your father.
Been there since you were born.
I will always love you.
Can you at least tell me his name?
Hello?
Yeah?
I'm looking for Robin.
Yeah, I'm Robin.
What can I do for you?
I was hoping to talk with you about Luke Glanton.
I'm his son.
You're Luke Glanton's son?
Yeah.
Well, come on back, get a beer.
Bet it's down here in this box, if I remember rightly.
God.
That guy's your dad.
That's him there.
And that's the pig there, the one that bagged him.
What happened to him?
Who, the cop?
Oh, forget about him, man. Don't...
Don't start there.
I'll show you good things.
I'll show you good things.
Come on.
You are standing right where your dad used to stand and we used to talk.
He was a good guy, your dad.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, those glasses.
I haven't seen those in a long time.
They're his, those goofy glasses.
These were his?
Yeah.
You can keep those.
He would've wanted you to have them.
Was he good at anything?
Yeah, he was the best motorcycle rider I've ever seen in my life.
The best.
Yeah? Best.
Never seen another one like him.
Best.
He was like nothing.
Rare.
Were you guys good friends?
Yeah, I think we were.
You still got his bike?
No, his bike's gone. Yeah.
Police took it.
I think they cut it up, you know.
They were angry with him.
I know that.
They were real mad with him.
I can show you some other things, too, if you want to see more.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Why don't you put the glasses on?
For sure, he would've said they were left there for you.
No doubt.
Put 'em on, if you want.
Go on, put 'em on.
Yeah?
Come on, I'll tell you.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Yeah? Yeah.
You're calling him back.
Jason!
Jason.
Let me talk to you.
Look, man, I wanted to say I'm sorry about what happened earlier, all right?
I was a dick.
I won't deny it.
You lost my money, all right?
Like, that's... I think that's all I need to really fucking say, all right?
But I'm willing to fucking squash it, okay?
If you do the squashing, I'll be the squasher.
I said I'm sorry, brother.
I meant that shit.
What you thinking?
Okay.
You dig?
Okay.
We good?
All right.
Dude, dude, yo, listen.
I'm having a fucking party at my pop's place tonight.
Dude, my pop's is fuckin' off-the-chain, B. Come along.
I can't do that, man, I'm sorry.
Why?
Can't make it tonight.
You got family stuff you gotta do?
No, but I got stuff I gotta do. Nah.
You wanna squash it, right?
We squashed it, man.
So then come tonight.
You want me to come to your party tonight?
I want you to come to my party.
Is that what you want?
All right, cool, I'll see you tonight.
All right. Hold up.
I'll see you tonight.
Another one. Hold up.
Do me a favor, B. Bring some Oxys, all right?
Then we straight. No, man.
What you mean, no?
You gotta make it correct.
I'll see you, man.
Nah, nah. You're not... I'll see you, okay?
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
We ain't seeing shit.
You coming tonight?
Yes.
You copping my Oxys?
Yes.
You got it?
All right, sounds good.
All right, sounds like a fucking plan.
It don't gotta be $500 worth, you know.
Yo, J!
Keep your head up, bro.
Be right back.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
What the fuck are you doing?
You little motherfucker, get back here!
You made it.
Ho-ho-ho!
Who wants some fuckin' Oxys?
Hello.
There we go, there we go, there we go.
Hello.
Who ain't got 'em?
Who ain't got 'em, hold your fucking hands out!
Take it.
Who... Who is that?
Is that AJ's dad?
I think so.
Is everything all right?
You okay?
You got something you need to tell me? Yo, what are you...
What do you gotta tell me? Huh?
You think I'm fucking stupid?
Yo, get the fuck outta here.
You think I'm fucking stupid?
Get the fuck outta here!
Think I'm stupid?
Get the fuck out... What, you can't fucking hear? What's your pop do?
Fuck's your problem, man?
Here's the fucking door. There, you motherfucker!
Get the fuck out.
Fuck you, man.
Jason.
Can you hear me, baby?
Vanessa, get your father.
Baby.
You're a liar.
He woke up?
He say something?
Hey, Jason.
Why don't you sit down and wait.
I'm gonna get the car.
Okay?
What the hell happened to you?
Yo, I need your help, all right?
Yeah, man, all right.
What you need my help for, man?
I need a gun.
You need a gun?
Come on, man.
What the fuck?
What the fuck are you doing?
Get on the fucking floor!
Oh, my God!
Fuck!
All right.
All right, I'll see you tomorrow. All right.
Are you alone?
What's going on?
Don't look at me.
Turn around.
We're gonna get in your car and you're just gonna keep driving.
Don't talk to me, or I'll shoot you in the back of your head.
Go.
Turn around.
Turn around.
How did you get into my house?
AJ let me in.
Is he okay?
Is he?
Give me your wallet.
Where's your wallet?
It's in my jacket. Give me your jacket.
You want my wallet?
Here, take my wallet.
Want my jacket?
My jacket.
Get on your knees.
What did you do to my son?
Get on your fucking knees!
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Please, just tell me my son's all right.
This isn't about your fucking son.
I'm sorry, Jason.
I'm sorry.
It was a tight race for over a year between Cross and Kellerman, and then unprecedented events over the last month made to threaten Cross' election bid.
First, allegations of underage drinking at his house, and then a violent robbery from a yet-unidentified intruder that left his son hospitalized with a concussion.
Remarkably, Cross has managed to right his campaign, and now, as you see, the District Attorney has just won the election for Attorney General.
We will go live now as Senator McFarley prepares to address the crowd of supporters.
I've had the honor of knowing Avery Cross since he was a boy.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure and my greatest honor to introduce the next Attorney General of the state of New York, Avery Cross!
Go. Curtain.
All right, AJ, you gotta go.
You gotta go out there.
There's a flag.
Go.
Go where the kid is. Go.
Thank you!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Yeah?
Mr. Anthony?
Yeah.
Hey, I, uh...
I called you, said I was gonna be out here today.
Oh, right, of course. Yeah.
Well, you're early.
Yeah.
There's only, like, one bus headed out here.
So... You're not from around here, huh?
No. I'm headed out west.
So you ready?
Wanna go take a look at it?
Yeah.
I'll just get my coat.
All right.
It runs great.
It's got a lot of miles on it, but I kept up with the maintenance.
How much you want for it?
Well, I was thinking I need five.
You ever ridden one of these before?
Stop!
Stand in your places!
Let's try it again.
Wadjda!
Come here.
Repeat the first two verses.
Don't you want us to hear your voice?
Move! Move!
Again.
Don't forget your keys.
Don't lock the top lock.
Your father might be late from his shift.
OK? God willing.
Long way ahead.
You every day late.
Must drive other teachers.
Next time you late, I not wait.
- My mum no late, you just arrive. - Ignore him!
I not talk to you, child.
I talk mama, she every day late.
Look!
Soon you'll be a pro!
Where have you been all week?
I've got something for you.
A volcanic stone from the Empty Quarter.
It's magnetic.
Dad!
Mum's been waiting all week for you.
The top lock is unlocked.
What a moustache!
It'd suit an advert for shaving soap.
This is a real moustache.
A falcon could sit on it.
I'd say an aeroplane!
Thanks for breakfast!
Aaah! Got my sandwich back at last!
Did you really think you could catch up with me?
If I had a bike, you'd see.
Girls, stop.
Why are you laughing out loud?
You forget that women's voices shouldn't be heard by men outside.
How often must I repeat this?
A woman's voice is her nakedness.
- Hello.
- We're sorry, it won't happen again.
Wadjda!
Where's your headscarf?
Did you come with your head uncovered?
Stop it, girls.
Don't laugh.
Hey!
Come up and play with us!
Let me touch those little apples.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, Wadjda!
- Don't talk to me!
- Just a second.
I've brought you something.
We're not even yet.
When I get my bike and I win the race, then we'll be even.
Don't you know that girls don't ride bikes?
Losing to a girl will be a double loss.
Move, boy.
Play somewhere else.
800 riyals.
Too expensive for you.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'll make you some lunch.
We were in a car without air conditioning for three hours.
That trip to the end of the world is killing me.
I don't like that look.
What's on your mind?
I want to buy a bike so I can race Abdullah.
Have you ever seen a girl on a bike?
I'd rather sell fruit at the hospital than do my daily commute.
And I come home and you tell me, "I want a bike."
Where are the bracelets?
I only made ten.
I worked my fingers to the bone.
Each one costs an extra two riyals.
I told you, I worked my fingers to the bone.
Here you go.
It's your turn.
Let's move, the men can see us.
Why?
Are they supermen?
If you can see them, they can see you.
Respectable girls go inside.
The rest stay where the men can see them.
Hey...
What are you doing here?
Go to your class.
Can't you see the men on the roof?
Girls, did you hear?
A thief got into Ms Hussa's house.
It was her lover, not a thief!
Her father thought it was a thief and called the police!
Sh! If she said it was a thief, then it was a thief.
You would say that, Salma.
The only man that would ever speak to you would have to be a thief.
Wadjda, Wadjda.
Can you take this to my brother?
It's my permission to exit card.
- I'll give you ten riyals.
- 20.
God, you...
He's waiting behind the school in a white pickup truck.
Wadjda.
Come tomorrow with your head covered, or I'll reserve a place in the sun for you.
I will, God willing.
Cover your face.
- Are you Abeer's brother?
- Of course I'm her brother.
Got the card?
Here it is. Abeer said you'd give me 20 riyals.
- Really?
- Yes!
OK, just take it.
What?
Even your cash reeks of cologne.
Did you know they invented a new thing called a tape player?
- Buying today?
- How would I know?
People need to browse, don't they?
You won't find any tapes back there.
We only have CDs.
Thanks!
See you tomorrow.
♪ The paradise of love is in your nature Don't you wish you were a singer?
Me, a singer!
God forbid!
I've saved up 87 riyals already.
I only need 713.
Couldn't you lend me the money?
Oh, no! Not that bike again?
Stop it!
Ms Hussa said I have to wear the full abaya to school.
Wow!
The full abaya?
Maybe it's time to marry you off!
Very funny!
Come with me.
Try this.
Oh, Mum, it's too long.
Hold it like that.
Oh, no, a thief, a thief!
A thief jumped over Ms Hussa's fence to see her.
We don't know that.
Maybe it was really a thief.
Shame on you for saying such things.
A thief.
A thief!
A thief!
I have to buy something really nice for your uncle's wedding, so all the other women think a hundred times before they look at your father.
I'm so sorry, Leila.
I really am.
Our driver Iqbal is so rude.
He shouted at poor Aiesha today.
I felt so sorry for her. She cried for three whole hours.
Abeer, Mariam's daughter?
She was caught with a man?
Do you know who he is?
Oh, I know who he is now!
God.
A playboy like his father.
Is he good-looking like his father?
You have to admit, his father is good-looking.
The religious police?
Mariam must be devastated!
They should have married her off ages ago.
Girls like that are nothing but trouble.
I have to go, Father's just arrived.
Keep me in the loop on this Abeer scandal.
Mm. Take care.
Bye.
What's the matter? Hm?
Don't worry, we won't marry you off.
Go and say hello to your father.
Hey, watch it! I'm losing.
I should have stayed with my usual fighter.
Is that a real school report or a fake like the one you made last year?
It's real.
I'm great at maths.
Shall I prove it?
Pythagoras' theorem is a miracle of God.
The triangle always stays the same!
Sounds like you know what you're talking about.
I'm saving to buy a bike.
I lost.
Where's the margoog?
What a beauty!
A superstar is here!
Stop it!
Superstar, eh?
Then why is your mother checking all over town for available women for you?
I don't think she's trying that hard.
Come and play with me!
I can't play.
Let me play!
Tapes with love songs...
Bracelets for football clubs...
Are you running a football fan club?
Don't you know that these items are forbidden?
Abeer was always a good girl.
She never caused any trouble.
Did you hear that she was caught with a young man who isn't family?
Did you arrange the rendezvous between Abeer and the man?
- No, I didn't!
- Don't lie.
I'm certain you were involved.
I just don't know in what way.
What should we do with you now?
Just a moment, please.
I'm not finished with her.
You may go back to your class.
We'll finish this discussion later.
And Wadjda, stop wearing those torn-up shoes.
Wear normal black shoes, like the other girls.
What's this?
The proposal for the Koran competition in the religious club.
I really don't know what to say, Principal!
All this because of a bike?
As long as I live, you won't get one.
Should I wait until you get expelled?
And turn off that damn radio and those evil songs!
Those songs have brought us nothing but evil.
You're no better than Abeer.
She's staying at home and her parents are marrying her off.
I should pay for it?
Why can't you pay for once?
I pay for your driver!
All your cash is in your woman's saving fund.
Yeah, and what about the bride price, you handsome groom?
Do you think I want to support two families?
Bear me a son and everything will be fine.
But we know that's not going to happen.
Forget it.
And don't count on me coming at all next week!
Don't come back!
Go to your mother's house and discuss potential brides.
Madam, only one hour I wait.
I have no time wait for you.
- You late, I go. You find taxi.
- Enough, Iqbal, I get it.
Who's that girl, Iqbal?
My daughter.
I haven't seen her for three years now.
She go school now.
I no go to school.
That's obvious, because you don't have any manners.
Shame on you.
You too have no manners.
I make better bracelets than these.
- Will you pay me ten per piece?
- No!
I buy them from China, I can get 10,000 for ten riyals.
- China won't do the national colours.
- You mean like these?
Wadjda!
Wadjda!
- Can I try on that dress?
- Of course.
There's a women's bathroom at the end of the corridor.
If it's too big, we can alter it for you.
Thanks.
What do you think?
Would your dad like it?
Let's take the dress back to the salesman so he can take it in.
Then let's go, before Iqbal gets angry and leaves us.
Don't worry, he won't leave.
Hand me my dress.
Who were you talking to about the bike yesterday?
What are you talking about?
I don't want you selling my bike to anyone else.
Here.
I made you a mix tape, since we're friends now.
But don't sell my bike.
God willing.
Ms Hussa will explain the rules of the Koran competition.
It's only five weeks away.
I'll pass around a sign-up sheet.
- Ms Hussa...
- Thanks.
First of all, we've increased the prize money.
It's now 1,000 instead of 800 riyals.
You'll have to learn the first five suras.
The competition has two parts.
The first involves vocabulary and God's revelation of the verses.
The second part is recitation.
The recitation has to be flawless.
I repeat, correct pronunciation is a must.
Good luck with your efforts.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
Yes?
What do you want?
I thought about what you said.
I was wrong and I'm ready to change.
Praise God!
All of a sudden?
I'd like to join the religious club.
How much?
Only 80 riyals.
Cheaper than a bike.
How about 62?
Select the right answer!
Who are the Sabians?
Wrong!
Please try again.
Who are the Sabians?
What?
Wrong!
Please try again.
Who are the Sabians?
- How am I supposed to know?
- Iqbal!
You get your monthly salary whether you drive me around or not.
Why do you talk to me like this?
Have you no shame?
Why?
You think you're the only driver around?
Tomorrow I'll find myself a better driver.
Guys, I'm late for school, I have to go!
Abdullah, how do I get to Derah?
Let's go.
Cover your face.
I'll say you're my sister.
Your sister?
No one will believe you.
I'm too good-looking to be related to you!
I can't arrange the commute.
Can't it count as emergency leave?
I lost my driver.
I'll open up the school for the entire month if I have to.
That's very kind of you.
Take care.
Do you know where Iqbal the driver lives?
Do you know how many drivers called Iqbal live here?
I hope we're following the right lead.
This could be his car.
That's it.
- What do you want?
- Iqbal?
It's not my business, it's yours.
OK.
You?
What do you want?
Iqbal, why did you do that?
Go away!
- Where's your residency permit?
- What do you want with it?
It's a good job. Go back to driving Wadjda's mother and you'll be fine.
You know my uncle, the guy with the moustache?
I'm sure he'd be interested to look further into your legal status.
"You know my uncle, the guy with the moustache?"
He knew him, right?
That moustache is a registered trademark!
Their son put explosives around his waist and boom, he died.
He's crazy!
That must hurt!
If you die for God, it's like a pin prick.
And then you fly up and you have 70 brides!
Really?
Boom!
70 bikes!
You've got it all wrong.
That's not how it works.
Come on, don't you miss us?
It's been almost two weeks.
Do you think about us?
Or is someone else on your mind?
If I'm the original brand, why are you looking for an imitation?
OK.
Take care.
Carry on studying.
Hello?
Hello, Leila!
Are you coming round?
Could you bring me the money you borrowed?
Really?
You're working in the hospital across the road?
Your husband doesn't mind you working with men?
What do you want?
My uncle wants me to string some lights across the street from your roof.
Ask the neighbours.
We don't care about your uncle.
They don't have a pole to hang them on.
Yours is the only roof that'll work.
Wait a minute.
Mum?
Thanks, honey.
When you want to be, you're such a sweetheart.
Abdullah wants to string up lights for the election so his uncle with the moustache will win.
Tell him no.
His uncle isn't from our tribe and we won't vote for him.
I'll let you onto the roof on one condition.
You have to bring your bike.
Hello, Wadjda.
You look so grown up and cute!
- Where's your mother?
- She's coming.
- How's school?
- Oh...
- I don't like it, but it's OK.
- Leila!
Traitor!
Working so close to my house without telling me.
Finally, I'm done with Iqbal.
Three hours in the car with him every day was about to kill me.
The hospital provides transport, and the pay and hours are good.
And the driver waits for me.
When's the party?
Next month.
I want to buy a nice dress for her uncle's engagement.
The potential wives will be at his brother's wedding as well.
God be with the one he chooses.
You might rip her heart out that night!
Oh, before I forget.
They're hiring at the hospital.
- It's closer and we can chat all day!
- My husband's so jealous.
He can't stand the thought of men looking at me.
Stop it!
You blame everything on your husband.
What's this?
It'll help you learn.
I need to work on the lights.
I can't push you all day.
You think I'm a little girl.
Here, I took them off.
I'll give you five riyals if you stop crying.
Now, girls, let's start.
Does each girl have her Koran?
Before we start...
If you're having a period, you're not allowed to touch the Koran.
This isn't a laughing matter.
You're young ladies now.
I said stop.
You should touch it with a tissue, not with your fingers.
Page 87.
Start with Surat An-Nisa', from Ayat 59.
Let's start with the new face.
Wadjda.
Wadjda, go ahead.
- O you who have believed...
- Louder.
O you who have believed...
- Obey...
- Obey Allah and... obey the Messenger...
- And those in authority...
- And those in authority, and if you disagree over anything...
You're mispronouncing the words.
- And if you disagree...
- And if you disagree over anything...
And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger...
If you should...
Stop, please.
Noura, continue.
O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and those in authority.
And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah.
Refer it to Allah and the Prophet.
All that fuss for a bike and you don't even know how to ride?
I have a plan.
What's that?
It's an antenna that gets all the radio stations.
My uncle's going to speak on the radio with famous Koran readers.
"It makes your heart melt," he says.
He should hear my mother sing!
She should have a channel of her own.
We'll talk about this later.
Where's the nail polish?
I hid it under there the other day.
What are you doing here?
Why were your hands under her skirt?
In my office, now!
Wadjda?
Wake up, honey.
Let's get up and say the dawn prayer.
I saw some girls on TV riding bikes.
Give me the money to buy one.
I know you have money.
I saw it in the drawer.
Here, girls don't ride bikes.
You won't be able to have children if you ride a bike!
You don't ride a bike and you can't have children!
How could you say that?
I almost died having you!
Wash for prayer!
God is great.
Girls.
Who can find a tajwid on this page?
Page 92.
- Which verse?
- Verse 88?
- Yes.
- "Who does..."
- What kind of tajwid?
- Idgham?
- What type?
- Moughana.
Excellent!
What do you think, Wadjda?
I think this competition is very difficult for me.
I heard on the Koran channel yesterday, if learning the Koran is difficult for you, God will reward you doubly.
Well done.
I want you all to take Wadjda as an example of a person who tries hard and is devoted to God.
- You're doing well!
- Thank you, Miss.
Excuse me.
Wadjda, Ms Hussa says she needs to see you.
Put your Koran aside.
You may not believe it, but, by God, you remind me of myself at your age.
And look at me now.
Close the door.
You still insist that you weren't doing anything behind the school?
We were reading magazines, that's all.
I'm not sure.
I was standing far away.
Thank you, Wadjda.
You may return to your class.
Give this file to Aunt Jamila.
Close the door.
This is a pledge.
You'll sign it and you'll be able to stay in school.
In the name of God, gracious and merciful,
I salute all you girls for your efforts this term.
I want to remind you that school is a place of learning and a place of morals.
Listen carefully.
Two students were caught in the back yard committing a sin.
The two are...
Faten Khaled and Fatima Abdullah.
To avoid similar situations, you're no longer allowed to bring flowers to school
or to give each other letters of love and admiration.
And no one is allowed to hold hands.
Do you understand?
You may go to your classes now.
Thank you.
Your bags are over there.
Don't touch me!
I wish I could cut my hair shorter, like Lobna Abdel Aziz's.
Do it.
Your father loves my hair long and smooth.
My mother saw the lights but forgot to ask me about them again.
She doesn't know?
What about your father?
I think they like your uncle, since he was on Koran Radio.
I'm bleeding...
Where's the blood coming from?
Your virginity!
From my knee!
Your knee?
Bikes are dangerous for girls!
You think you can act like a boy?
And you!
Why did you let her ride the bike?
Come back!
Take that bike with you!
I'll tell your uncle to teach you some manners.
Get up.
Shame on you, bringing a boy upstairs with no one home!
If your father knew, he'd kill you!
Sh! Do you want the men to hear you?
Take the bread out of the oven.
Wow!
All this food!
They'll be really impressed.
You make me so proud!
Obviously not proud enough.
Turki, Saleh, Ali, Abdurahman,
Abulazziz, Rashed, Abdullah...
My father!
Interested in your father's glorious family tree?
You aren't on it.
It only includes men's names.
Clean up when you've finished.
Hide the traces of your crime.
I don't want to make him upset with us again.
Wadjda
Give me the picture!
I said give me the picture!
What's going on?
Salma just got married and brought pictures of her wedding.
Congratulations!
Can I see the pictures?
Are these of your wedding?
Is this your husband?
- How old is he?
- 20.
It's not funny.
Pictures are forbidden at school.
Let's get started.
Surat An-Nisa', page 97.
Wadjda, start with verse 115.
- I'll try to recite the verses.
- Really?
Close the Koran and go ahead.
Whoever opposes the Messenger, after guidance has become clear to him, and follows the path of the non-believer,
- we will give him what he has taken...
- We will give him...
We will give him what he has taken... and drive him into hell, that most evil destination.
Terrific!
You need to work on your tarteel and your tajwid.
If you aim to win, you must recite like Salma.
Salma, please read verse 115 again.
♪ In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
♪ Whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him
♪ And follows the path of the non-believer
♪ We will give him what he has taken
♪ And drive him into hell, that most evil destination
♪ Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with him
♪ But he forgives what is less than that for whom he wills
♪ And he who associates others with Allah has certainly gone far astray ♪
Great!
Are you cross with me?
I've got homework to do.
Wait a second.
Here, I got you a helmet, like the ones on TV.
Wanna ride in the empty lot?
We've got a few minutes before people come.
OK.
Abdullah!
Look!
The toy shop owner told Khalid and his dad someone had reserved the bike.
He must be holding it for me!
Right answer!
Select the right answer!
Who are the Sabians?
I know the answer!
Correct!
At last!
Well, if you won't listen to me, I don't know why I should listen to you!
Get ready, we're going out.
Don't leave the Koran open.
The devil might spit into it.
Are you going to work here with Leila?
Those lab coats are cool, like The Matrix but white!
Sh! I just want to give her something.
Wadjda!
Hello and welcome!
Leila, why isn't your face covered?
Wait, let me get you the application form.
Welcome!
How are you?
Fine, thank you.
It's a good job, and the vacancies are filling up quickly.
You should...
Leila!
Stop it.
I just came by to say hello.
I'll call you later, you look busy.
- Take care.
- Why are you going?
Take care.
I thought you were going to apply.
He created for you helpmeats from yourselves so that you may find rest in them...
No, honey, give it a tone like this.
♪ And among his signs is this.
He created for you helpmeats from yourselves
♪ So that you may find rest in them
♪ And he ordained between you love and mercy
♪ Verily in that are signs for those who reflect ♪
I feel shy!
I can't recite like that in front of everyone.
You, shy?
Ha!
I only wish it were true!
Look!
There's my father!
- Where?
- There!
So do you love him?
Who?
- Your father?
- No, the neighbour's boy!
I don't think I'm the one in love with the neighbour's boy!
Ha-ha-ha.
That's not funny.
You didn't answer.
Do you love him?
Oh...
I was at secondary school when he asked for my hand.
All the girls went crazy when they saw his picture.
They were so jealous.
He was the first man in my life and will hopefully be the last.
You're the prettiest woman I've ever seen.
You'll give him a heart attack with your red dress.
Don't worry.
He would never burn my heart with a second wife.
Let's practise reciting for the competition tomorrow.
Go on.
And among his signs is this.
He created for you helpmates from yourselves
So that you may find rest in them
And he ordained between you love and mercy
The words need to come from your heart.
Ignore your surroundings.
Read from your heart.
I'd love to be there tomorrow and see you win.
But I have to commute to the end of the world again.

Please start with verse seven of Surat Al-Baqarah.
Begin at "God sealed their hearts".
Allah hath set a seal on their hearts...
♪ Allah hath set a seal on their hearts
And their hearing and sight are veiled
♪ Great is the penalty they incur
♪ Of the people there are some who say
♪ "We believe in Allah and the Last Day"
♪ But they do not really believe
♪ They would deceive Allah and those who believe
♪ But they only deceive themselves and don't realise it
♪ In their hearts is a disease
♪ And Allah has increased their disease
♪ And grievous is the penalty they incur
♪ Because they are false to themselves
♪ When it is said to them, "Make not mischief on the earth,"
♪ They say, "Why, we only want to make peace"
♪ Certainly, they are the ones who make mischief
♪ But they don't realise it ♪
That was wonderful, Wadjda!
Are you sure you want to pray next to us?
Congratulations!
The winner hasn't been announced yet.
You won!
You're their favourite convert.
I'm sure they were all on your side.
Wadjda?
Come here!
We saved you a place in the first row.
Coward.
Get in line.
Move closer.
Don't leave a gap for the devil.
God is great.
God is great.
Allah listens to he who praises him.
God is great.
Be quiet, girls.
Silence!
The competition finalists are...
Noura Saleh, Salma Abdel Azziz, and Wadjda Al Saffan.
And now, the third prize goes to...
Salma Abdul Azziz.
Congratulations!
The winner of the second prize is...
Noura Saleh.
Congratulations, Noura!
Wadjda, you're our champion.
Congratulations!
You've won because of your devotion and perseverance.
I hope all the girls here today learn from your example.
Congratulations!
And what are your plans regarding the prize money?
I'm going to buy a bike from the shop down the street.
What?
I'm buying a bike.
With no training wheels, since I know how to ride one.
Wouldn't it be better if we donated the money to our brethren in Palestine?
You know, a bike isn't a toy for girls.
Especially not for well-behaved, devout girls who protect their soul and honour.
I'm sure your family won't allow it.
We'll donate the money, and God willing, you'll be rewarded for your generosity.
Please go back to your seat.
That's all, girls, you can leave now.
So nothing has changed after all.
You think you can act however you want and people won't notice?
Your stupid behaviour will haunt you forever.
You mean like your "handsome" thief?
Didn't you win?
Where's the money?
In Palestine!
I'll give you my bike!
Then how will we race?
Wadjda?
I want to marry you when we're older.
Hey, you're home at last.
What's with the new hairstyle?
Your mother won't answer my calls.
Can I have a look?
You won?
I can't believe it.
You're my little darling!
Why are you crying?
You're the winner.
Just a second.
Hello?
I'm so proud of you, my little champ.
I've been trying to call your mother all day.
When she gets back, tell her I love her.
Hello?
Hi, Aunt Leila.
No, I don't know where she is.
Yeah, she's usually home by now.
OK, I'll let her know.
Bye.
Congratulations, I heard the news.
They said you won.
I couldn't believe it.
If you set your mind to something, no one can stop you.
They didn't give me the money.
I couldn't believe you told them you wanted to buy a bike.
You don't need them or their money.
What's going on at Grandma's?
I thought my uncle's wedding wasn't until next month.
It's not your uncle's wedding.
It's all right.
He made his decision.
It'll just be you and me now.
Let's buy the red dress... and go over there and get him!
There's no need for the red dress any more.
Besides, I already spent the money.
I hope it's the right one.
The man at the shop had been holding it for weeks.
For some spunky little girl.
I want you to be the happiest person in the world.
You're all I have left in this world.
Abdullah.
Goal!
Catch me if you can!
So you were raised in a zoo?
Pl: Born and raised.
In Pondicherry, in what was the French part of India.
My father owned the zoo... and I was delivered on short notice by a herpetologist... who was there to check on the Bengal monitor lizard.
Mother and I were both healthy... but the poor lizard escaped... and was trampled by a frightened cassowary.
The way of karma, huh?
The way of God.
That's quite a story.
I had assumed your father was a mathematician because of your name.
Far from it, I was named after a swimming pool.
There is a swimming pool named "Pi"?
You see, my uncle Francis was born with too much water in his lungs.
They say the doctors swung Francis around by the ankles to clear the water out... and that's what gave him the huge chest and skinny legs... that made him such a great swimmer.
Is Francis actually your uncle?
He said he was friends with your father.
He's my honorary uncle, I call him Mamaji.
My father's best friend, my swimming guru.
Pl: I trained with him three times a week at the ashram.
His lessons would save my life in the end.
A mouthful of water will not harm you, but panic will.
Remember to breathe now, don't hold your breath.
Good boy.
I hope you don't mind vegetarian.
No, no.
Not at all.
And your name?
Huh?
You were going to tell me how you got your name, I think.
Oh, yes.
I got it from something Mamaji once told my father.
You see, most travelers collect postcards or teacups on their journeys... but not Mamaji.
Mamaji collects swimming pools.
He swims in every pool he comes upon.
One day, Mamaji said to my father that, of all the pools in the world... the most beautiful was a public pool in Paris.
That the water there was so clear, you could make your morning coffee with it.
That a single swim there changed his life.
Before I was born, he said...
"If you want your son to have a clean soul...
"you must take him one day to swim in the Piscine Molitor. "
I never understood why my father took this so much to heart.
But he did, and I was named "Piscine Molitor Patel. "
Imagine me trying to explain that name.
I barely made it to the age of 11 before...
Hey, Piscine!
Are you pissing right now?
Look at him, he's pissing!
With one word, my name went from an elegant French swimming pool... to a stinking Indian latrine.
I was "Pissing" everywhere.
No Pissing in the schoolyard!
Pl: Even the teachers started doing it.
Not deliberately, of course.
So, then, what might occur if we release gas too quickly?
Pissing?
He said "Pissing. "
That's enough!
Order!
Order!
Pl: When we returned the next year for our first day of school,
I was prepared.
Present, sir.
Piscine Patel.
Good morning. lam Piscine Molitor Patel.
Known to all as...
Pi, the sixteenth letter of the Greek alphabet... which is also used in mathematics to represent the ratio... of any circle's circumference to its diameter.
An irrational number of infinite length, usually rounded to three digits... as 3.14.
Pi.
Very impressive, Pi.
Now, sit down.
And from then on, you were "Pi"?
Pl: Well, no, not quite.
Nice try, Pissing.
Pl: But I still had the whole day ahead of me.
French class was next.
Je m'appelle Piscine Molitor Patel.
Di! ' Pi.
Pl: Then, geography-
These are the first 20 decimal places of pi.
Pl: My last class of the day was mathematics.
Slowly, slowly, slowly.
Three. Seven. Five.
Eight. Five. Eight.
It's right.
He's really doing this.
Pi!
Pi!
Pi!
Pl: By the end of that day, I was Pi Patel, school legend.
Um, Mamaji tells me you're a legend among sailors, too.
Out there, all alone.
Oh, I don't even know how to sail.
And I wasn't alone out there.
Richard Parker was with me.
Richard Parker?
Mamaji didn't tell me everything.
He just said I should look you up when I got back to Montreal.
So, what were you doing in Pondicherry?
Writing a novel.
By the way, I enjoyed your first book.
So, this new one, is it set in India?
No, Portugal, actually.
But it's cheaper living in India.
Ah, well, I look forward to reading it.
You can't.
I threw it out.
Two years trying to bring this thing to life... and then one day, it sputtered, coughed and died.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Uh, I was sitting in this coffee house in Pondicherry one afternoon, mourning my loss... when this old man at the table next to me struck up a conversation.
Yeah, Mamaji, he does that.
When I told him about my abandoned book, he said...
"So, a Canadian who's come to French India
"in search of a story. "
"Well, my friend, I know an Indian in French Canada...
"with the most incredible story to tell.
"It must be fate that the two of you should meet. "
Well, I haven't spoken about Richard Parker in so many years.
So, what has Mamaji already told you?
He said you had a story that would make me believe in God.
He would say that about a nice meal.
As for God, I can only tell you my story.
You will decide for yourself what you believe.
Fair enough.
Let's see, then.
Where to begin?
Pondicherry is the French Riviera of India.
In the streets closest to the ocean, you might think you were in the south of France.
A few blocks inland, there's a canal.
Just beyond that is Indian Pondicherry.
And the Muslim quarter is just to the west.
When the French handed Pondicherry back to us in 1954... the town decided that some sort of commemoration was in order.
My father, who was a clever businessman, came up with one.
He ran a hotel, and he got the idea to open a zoo... in the local botanical gardens instead.
Pl: As it also happened, my mother was a botanist in the gardens.
They met, married, and a year later my brother Ra w' was born.
I came two years after that.
It sounds magical, growing up in...
Amen.
Yeah, let's eat.
I didn't know Hindus said "amen. "
Catholic Hindus do.
Catholic Hindus?
We get to feel guilty before hundreds of gods, instead of just one.
But you're a Hindu first?
None of us knows God until someone introduces us.
I was first introduced to God as a Hindu.
There are 33 million gods in the Hindu religion.
How can I not come to know a few of them?
I met Krishna first.
Yashoda once accused baby Krishna of eating dirt.
"Tut, tut you naughty boy - you shouldn't do that. "
But he didn't!
That's what he told her.
"I didn't eat dirt. "
Yashoda said, "No?
Well then... "
"Open your mouth. "
So Krishna opened his mouth.
And what do you think Yashoda saw?
What'?
She saw in Krishna's mouth the whole entire universe.
Pl: The gods were my superheroes growing up.
Hanuman, the monkey god... lifting an entire mountain to save his friend Lakshman.
Ganesh, the elephant-headed... risking his life to defend the honor of his mother, Parvati.
Vishnu, the supreme soul, the source of all things.
Vishnu sleeps, floating on the shoreless cosmic ocean... and we are the stuff of his dreaming.
Spectacle.
Don't let these stories and pretty lights fool you, boys.
Religion is darkness.
Pl: My dear appa believed himself part of the new India.
As a child, he had had polio.
He used to lie in bed racked with pain, wondering where God was.
In the end, God didn't save him, Western medicine did.
My amma went to college... and thought her family was part of the new India as well... until her parents cut her off... because they thought she was marrying beneath her.
Her religion was the only link she had to her past.
I met Christ in the mountains when I was 12.
We were visiting relatives, tea growers in Munnar.
It was our third day there. Ravi and I were terribly bored.
Challenge.
I'll give you two rupees.
Run in to that church and drink the holy water.
You must be thirsty.
Here.
I brought you this.
Why would a god do that?
Why would He send His own son... to suffer for the sins of ordinary people?
Because He loves us.
God made Himself approachable to us, human, so we could understand Him.
We can't understand God in all His perfection.
But we can understand God's son and His suffering as we would a brother's.
That made no sense.
Sacrificing the innocent to atone for the sins of the guilty...
What kind of love is that?
But this son...
I couldn't get him out of my head.
If God is so perfect and we are not... why would He want to create all this?
Why does He need us at all?
All you have to know is that He loves us.
God so loved this world that He gave His only son.
The longer I listened to the priest... the more I came to like this son of God.
Thank you, Vishnu, for introducing me to Christ.
I came to faith through Hinduism and I found God's love through Christ.
But God wasn't finished with me yet.
Pl: God works in mysterious ways.
And so it was, He introduced Himself again.
This time by the name of Allah.
Allahu Akbar.
Pl:
My Arabic was never very good... but the sound and feel of the words brought me closer to God.
In performing Salah... the ground I touched became holy ground... and I found a feeling of serenity and brotherhood.
This lamb is exquisite.
It's the best dish on the table.
You're all missing out.
You only need to convert to three more religions, Piscine... and you will spend your life on holiday.
Are you going to Mecca this year, Swami Jesus?
Or to Rome for your coronation as Pope Pi-us?
You stay out of this, Ravi.
Just as you like cricket, Pi has his own interests.
No, Gita, Ravi has a point.
You cannot follow three different religions at the same time, Piscine.
Why not?
Because believing in everything at the same time... is the same as not believing in anything at all.
He's young, Santosh.
He's still finding his way.
And how can he find his way if he does not choose a path?
Listen, instead of leaping from one religion to the next... why not start with reason?
In a few hundred years... science has taken us farther in understanding the universe... than religion has in 10,000.
That is true.
Your father is right.
Science can teach us more about what is out there... but not what is in here.
Some eat meat, some eat vegetable.
I do not expect us all to agree about everything... but I would much rather have you believe in something I don't agree with... than to accept everything blindly.
And that begins with thinking rationally.
Do you understand?
Good.
I would like to be baptized.
So, you're a Christian and a Muslim?
And a Hindu, of course.
And a Jew, I suppose.
Well, I do teach a course on the Kabbalah at the university.
And why not?
Faith is a house with many rooms.
But no room for doubt?
Oh, plenty.
On every floor.
Doubt is useful.
It keeps faith a living thing.
After all, you cannot know the strength of your faith until it's been tested.
Where's Selvam?
We shouldn't be in here without him.
Stop worrying.
I have seen him do this a thousand times.
I want to meet our new tiger.
Pi!
Hello?
Richard Parker?
A tiger?
Richard Parker was a tiger?
Yeah, he got his name through a clerical error.
A hunter caught him drinking from a stream when he was a cub... and named him Thirsty.
When Thirsty got too big, the hunter sold him to our zoo... but the names got switched on the paperwork.
The hunter was listed as Thirsty, and the tiger was called Richard Parker.
We laughed about it, and the name stuck.
Let's go... before we get into trouble.
I want to see him close up.
You're not a zookeeper.
Come on!
That's it, Richard Parker.
It's for you.
No!
What are you thinking?
Are you out of your mind?
Who gave you permission to come back here?
You have just ignored everything I've ever taught you.
I just wanted to say hello to him.
You think that tiger is your friend'?
He's an animal, not a playmate.
Animals have souls.
I have seen it in their eyes.
Find Selvam.
You're sure, Sir'?
Pi's just a boy.
Do it. Go ahead!
Animals do not think like we do.
People who forget that get themselves killed.
That tiger is not your friend.
When you look into his eyes... you are seeing your own emotions reflected back at you.
Nothing else.
Don't be stupid.
Say you're sorry.
What have you done, Piscine?
You know what your father said about coming back here.
I am sorry.
I was...
What are you thinking?
This is between a father and his sons.
He said he's sorry.
You want to scar them for life?
Scar them?
That boy almost lost his arm.
But he's still a boy.
He will be a man sooner than you think.
And this is a lesson I do not want them ever to forget.
Selvam!
...and so has placed the country in a state of emergency.
Under the directive, the states of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu... will be placed under the direct authority of the central government.
Police will be granted powers... to arrest and indefinitely detain citizens responsible for the uprising.
Pl: Things changed after the day of Appa's lesson.
The world had lost some of its enchantment.
School was a bore.
Nothing but facts, fractions and French.
Words and patterns that went on and on, without end.
Just like my irrational nickname.
I grew restless searching for something that might bring meaning back into my life.
And then, I met Anandi.
Mother made me study music.
And one day, my teacher came down with the flu.
He asked if I could take his place, playing rhythms for a dance class.
No.
If you do not concentrate... you cannot express your love of God through dance.
Feel the ground beneath your feet.
Open your gaze out onto the horizon.
Let that spiritual energy pulse through you and out into the world.
Through abhinaya.
Anandi, come to the front.
Lead them.
Why are you following me?
What?
You were following me.
What does this mean?
In the dance, you went from pataka... which means the forest.
And then you did... samputa... which means something that is hidden.
And after that, you did this.
And then you did chatura.
But at the very end, you did this.
None of the other dancers did that.
What did you mean?
The god of love is hiding in the forest?
No, that also means the lotus flower.
Lotus flower is hiding in the forest?
Why would a lotus flower hide in the forest?
And this is Richard Parker.
He is the most magnificent creature we've ever had here.
Look at the way he's turning his head.
Showing off.
Like a dancer.
No, he heard something.
He's listening, you see?
We have talked about it for some time.
Do you understand what I'm saying'?
Pi'?
Sorry, you've been...
Worried.
For my family.
Our animals are worth far more abroad than here in India.
And if the town council stops supporting us...
I don't know where we will be.
So, it is what we have to do.
Do you understand?
I'm sorry, what are we talking about?
We are leaving India.
What?
We are selling the zoo.
The zoo was never ours to sell. The land belongs to the town.
But the animals are ours and if we sell them... we will have enough to start a new life.
But where would we go?
Our life is here, Appa.
Canada.
I have some opportunities for work in Winnipeg.
I'll be shipping most of the animals for sale in North America.
We can get freighter passage for the whole family.
So...
It is settled.
We will sail like Columbus.
But Columbus was looking for India.
Pl: It takes a lot of work to sell a zoo.
Before we left...
Anandi and I had time enough to break each other's hearts.
Of course, I promised I would come back one day.
It's funny.
I remember everything else about our last day.
But I don't remember saying goodbye.
Pi? They're serving dinner below.
Piscine... you have a whole life ahead of you.
We are doing this for you and Ravi.
Come inside and have some dinner.
Vegetarian, please.
Oh, my sons and I are vegetarians.
Do you have anything...
No, no, no.
Not more gravy.
You don't want gravy?
No.
No, I want something vegetarian.
Oh.
Pas de problème.
She asked if you have something vegetarian.
The cow that produced this liver was vegetarian, the pigs that went into these sausages were vegetarian.
Very funny.
But my wife doesn't eat liver.
Pas de problème.
Then she can eat the sausage, the rice, and the gravy.
Or you can cook your own food.
Haw dare you talk to my wife like that?
Here's your rice.
I cook for sailors... not curry-eaters.
What did you say?
Let go of me!
Who do you think you are?
You're nothing but a servant!
I feed people!
You feed monkeys!
Hello.
I am happy Buddhist.
So, I eat rice next to gravy.
On ship, gravy is not meat.
Is taste.
You try?
Don't worry.
We will have plenty of fresh supplies after we stop in Manila.
Why give Orange Juice tranquilizers?
She's not going to cause any trouble.
The stress of traveling is not good for the animals... and it helps with the seasickness.
We don't want to be cleaning up after a seasick orangutan... do we?
Pl: My father was a businessman.
He had never tended the animals himself.
I realized... leaving India must have been harder for him than it was for me.
So...
Have I forgotten anything?
I think you've set the stage.
So far, we have an Indian boy named after a French swimming pool... on a Japanese ship full of animals, heading to Canada.
Yes.
Now, we have to send our boy into the middle of the Pacific and...
And make me believe in God.
Yeah.
We'll get there.
It was four days out of Manila... above the Mariana Trench, the deepest spot on Earth.
Our ship, The Tsimtsum, pushed on, bullishly indifferent to its surroundings.
It moved with the slow, massive confidence of a continent.
Ravi?
Did you hear that, Ravi?
I'm sleeping.
It's a thunderstorm.
Let's go watch.
Are you crazy?
We will get hit by lightning.
No, we won't.
It will hit the bridge first.
Don't tempt a storm, Pi.
Whoa.
Oh!
More rain!
More rain!
Lord of Storms!
Whoa!
Lightning!
Ah!
Amma!
Appa!
Ravi!
Get out!
Get out!
Help me!
Help!
Get in the boat!
Please! Save my family!
Don't scare, okay?
Wait, stay here!
You have to help them!
Please!
Put this on.
No, no, my family!
Please!
We have to help them!
We don't have time.
My family's back there!
We help!
You must go!
Who let all the animals out?
You have to go now!
No, wait, my father!
He can't swim!
Go!
Hang on to the boat!
Hold, hold!
Bring it down!
Hey!
You! What are you doing?
Jump!
Hey, hey!
Hey!
Over here!
Over here!
Richard Parker?
No!
No!
No!
Go away!
Go away!
Agh!
Amma!
Anna!
Ravi.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
Hari?
Looks as though your drugs haven't worn off yet.
Orange Juice!
Orange Juice!
Welcome to Pi's Ark.
Where is your boy, Orange Juice?
Don't worry, I bet mother and father found him.
They'll all be here soon.
Hello!
Hello!
Anybody!
No!
Stop it!
No!
Stop m Stop m.
No!
I'm sorry, Orange Juice.
I don't have any seasickness medicine for you.
Supplies.
Oh, supplies!
Yes!
Yes!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Mmm.
My name is Pi Patel.
I have been in a shipwreck.
I am on a lifeboat alone... with a tiger.
Please send help.
God, I give myself to you.
I am your vessel.
Whatever comes, I want to know.
Show me.
There are no lines.
Set your house in order and dig in for the battle to survive.
Establish a strict schedule for eating, keeping watch and getting rest.
Do not drink urine or sea water.
Keep busy but avoid unnecessary exertion.
The mind can be kept occupied by playing card games...
Twenty Questions, or! Spy.
Community singing is another surefire way to lift the spirits.
Telling stories is highly recommended.
Above all, don't lose hope.
Few things can sap the spirit faster than seasickness.
Waves are most strongly felt when a boat turns sideways to the current.
A sea anchor is used as a drag to keep the boat's head to the wind.
Proper use of them can increase control and reduce seasickness during rough seas.
For castaways who must share their lifeboats with large, dangerous carnivores... it's advisable to establish a territory as your own.
Try this method.
Step one.
Choose a day when waves are moderate, but regular.
Step two.
With the lifeboat facing into the waves... making the ride as comfortable as possible, blow your whistle soothingly.
Step three.
Turn the lifeboat sideways to the waves... accompanied by harsh, aggressive use of the whistle.
With sufficient repetition... the animal will associate the sound of the whistle... with the discomfort of seasickness.
Similar methods have long been used by circus trainers... though they generally lack access to rough seas.
Let the trumpets blare!
Let the drum rolls begin!
Prepare to be amazed!
Here it is, for your enjoyment and instruction!
The show you've been waiting for all your life... will soon begin!
Are you ready for the miracle of it?
Well, then, I give to you... the astounding Bengal tiger!
Hello, Richard Parker.
Sorry about the choppy ride.
Mine!
You understand?
Yours, mine!
You understand?
Ew!
Step four.
Disregard steps one through three.
Here, Richard Parker.
I got some water for you.
In the zoo, we fed our tigers an average of five kilos of meat a day.
Richard Parker will be getting hungry soon.
Tigers are powerful swimmers, and if he gets hungry enough...
I'm afraid the little bit of water between us won't be any protection.
I need to find a way to feed him.
I can eat the biscuits but God made tigers carnivores... so I must learn to catch fish.
If! don't, I'm afraid his last meal will be a skinny, vegetarian boy.
Patience!
What am I doing?
Wait!
I'm thinking.
Thirty-two cartons of biscuits.
Ninety-three cans of water.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Lord Vishnu.
Thank you for coming in the form of a fish and saving our lives.
Thank you.
Of course, I brought all the biscuits and water on the raft with me to keep them safe.
Idiot.
Hunger can change everything you ever thought you knew about yourself.
Here, it's yours!
Oh!
Ah!
Mine!
Mine!
I can't risk my life every time
I have to climb onto the boat for supplies.
It's time to settle this.
If we're going to live together, we have to learn to communicate.
Maybe Richard Parker can't be tamed, but with God's will, he can be trained.
No!
Good.
Go, Richard Parker.
Go.
Go on home, I'll leave you alone.
I'll respect that, I promise.
Go. Come on.
Yes!
I never thought a small piece of shade could bring me so much happiness.
That a pile of tools, a bucket, a knife, a pencil... might become my greatest treasures.
Or that knowing Richard Parker was here might ever bring me peace.
In times like these...
I remember that he has as little experience with the real world as I do.
We were both raised in a zoo by the same master.
Now we've been orphaned, left to face our ultimate master together.
Without Richard Parker, I would have died by now.
My fear of him keeps me alert.
Tending to his needs gives my life purpose.
Dolphins.
Hey, Richard Parker!
Hey!
Above all, don't lose hope.
Eight, five, five, zero, three, six, six... zero, eight, zero, one... three, six, zero, four, six, six, eight...
What are you looking at?
Talk to me.
Tell me what you see.
Words are all I have left to hang on to.
Everything mixed up. Fragmented.
Can't tell daydreams, night dreams, from reality anymo...
Storm, Richard Parker.
No!
No!
Praise be to God!
Lord of all worlds!
The compassionate, the merciful!
Ah!
Come out.
Richard Parker!
Come out, you have to see this!
It's beautiful!
Don't hide yourself!
He's come to us!
It's a miracle!
Come out and see God, Richard Parker!
Why are you scaring him?
Oh, God!
I've lost my family!
I've lost everything!
I surrender!
What more do you want?
I'm sorry, Richard Parker.
We're dying, Richard Parker.
I'm sorry.
Amma, Appa, Ravi...
I'm happy I'm going to see you soon.
Can you feel the rain?
God, thank you for giving me my life.
I'm ready now.
Richard Parker?
Mmm.
Excuse me.
Move.
Move.
Excuse me.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, come on!
HEY-
Hey, get away.
This is my bed.
It was a human tooth?
Don't you see?
The island was carnivorous.
Carnivorous?
Like a Venus Flytrap?
Yes, the whole island.
The plants, the water in those pools, the very ground itself.
During the day, those pools held fresh water.
But at night, some chemical process turned the water in those pools into acid... acid that dissolved those fish... that sent the meerkats scurrying into the trees, and Richard Parker running to the boat.
But where did the tooth come from?
Years ago, some poor fellow, just like me... must have found himself stranded on that island... and, like me, thought he might stay there forever.
But all that the island gave him by day, it took away again by night.
To think, how many hours spent with only meerkats for company.
How much loneliness taken on.
All I know is that eventually he died and the island digested him... leaving behind only his teeth.
I saw how my life would end if I stayed on that island.
Alone and forgotten.
I had to get back to the world, or die trying.
I spent the next day preparing the boat.
I filled my stores with fresh water... ate seaweed until my stomach could take no more... and brought as many meerkats as I could fit into the storage locker for Richard Parker.
I couldn't leave without him, of course.
It would mean killing him.
And so, I waited for his return.
I knew he wouldn't be late.
Richard Parker!
No one has seen that floating island since.
And you won't read about those trees in any nature book.
And yet, if I hadn't found those shores, I would have died.
If I hadn't discovered that tooth,
I would have been lost, alone forever.
Even when God seemed to have abandoned me...
He was watching.
Even when He seemed indifferent to my suffering...
He was watching.
And when I was beyond all hope of saving, He gave me rest... then gave me a sign to continue my journey.
By the time we reached the Mexican shore,
I was afraid to let go of the boat.
My strength was gone.
I was so weak.
I was afraid that in two feet of water, so close to deliverance...
I would drown.
I struggled to shore and fell upon the sand.
It was warm and soft... like pressing my face against the cheek of God.
And somewhere, two eyes were smiling at having me there.
I was so spent, I could hardly move.
And so, Richard Parker went ahead of me.
He stretched his legs and walked along the shore.
At the edge of the jungle, he stopped.
I was certain he was going to look back at me... flatten his ears to his head, growl.
That he would bring our relationship to an end in some way.
But he just stared ahead into the jungle.
And then, Richard Parker, my fierce companion... the terrible one who kept me alive... disappeared forever from my life.
After a few hours, a member of my own species found me.
He left and returned with a group who carried me away.
I wept like a child.
Not because I was overwhelmed at having survived, although I was.
I was weeping because Richard Parker left me so unceremoniously.
It broke my heart.
You know, my father was right.
Richard Parker never saw me as his friend.
After all we had been through, he didn't even look back.
But I have to believe there was more in his eyes... than my own reflection staring back at me.
I know it.
I felt it.
Even if I can't prove it.
You know, I've left so much behind.
My family, the zoo, India, Anandi.
I suppose, in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go.
But what always hurts the most... is not taking a moment to say goodbye.
I was never able to thank my father for all I learned from him.
To tell him, without his lessons...
I would never have survived.
I know Richard Parker is a tiger, but I wish I had said...
"it's over.
We survived.
"Thank you for saving my life.
I love you, Richard Parker.
"You will always be with me.
"May God be with you. "
I don't know what to say.
It's hard to believe, isn't it?
It is a lot to take in.
To figure out what it all means.
If it happened, it happened.
Why should it have to mean anything?
Some of it is pretty incredible.
See, I was the only one who survived the shipwreck.
So the Japanese shipping company sent two men to talk to me... in the Mexican hospital where I was recovering.
I still have a copy of their report.
They had insurance claims to settle... and they wanted to find out why the ship sank.
They didn't believe me, either.
Thousands of meerkats on a floating carnivorous island... and no one has ever seen it?
Yes, just like I told you.
Bananas don't float.
Why are you talking about bananas?
You said the orangutan floated to you on a bundle of bananas.
But bananas don't float.
Are you sure about that?
Of course they do.
Try it for yourself.
In any case, we are not here to talk about bananas or meerkats.
Look, I've just told you along story and I'm very tired.
We are here because a Japanese cargo ship sank in the Pacific.
Something I never forget.
I lost my whole family.
Get him some water.
We don't mean to push you.
And you have our deepest sympathies.
But we have come a long way... and we are no closer to understanding why the ship sank.
Because I don't know.
I was asleep.
Something woke me up.
It could have been an explosion, I can't be sure.
And then the ship sank.
What else do you want from me?
A story that won't make us look like fools.
We need a simpler story for our report.
One our company can understand.
A story we can all believe.
So, a story without things you've never seen before.
That's right.
Without surprises.
Without animals or islands.
Yes.
The truth.
So, what did you do?
I told them another story.
Four of us survived.
The cook and the sailor were already aboard.
The cook threw me a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard... and Mother held on to some bananas and made it to the lifeboat.
The cook was a disgusting man.
He ate a rat.
We had food enough for weeks, but he found the rat in the first few days... and he killed it, dried it in the sun and ate it.
He was such a brute, that man.
But he was resourceful.
It was his idea to build the raft to catch fish.
We would have died in those first few days without him.
The sailor was the same man who brought rice and gravy, the Buddhist.
We didn't understand much of what he said, only that he was suffering.
He had broken his leg horribly in the fall.
We tried to set it as best we could, but the leg became infected... and the cook said that we had to do something or he'd die.
The cook said he'd do it, but Mother and I had to hold the man down.
And I believed him, we needed to do it.
So...
I kept saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. "
And he just kept looking at me.
His eyes were so...
I'll never understand the point of that man's suffering.
I can still hear him.
The happy Buddhist, he only ate rice and gravy.
We didn't save him, of course.
He died.
The morning after, the cook caught his first dorado... and I didn't understand what he had done at first, but Mother did... and I had never seen Mother so angry.
"Stop whining and be happy," he said.
"We need more food or we'll die.
That was the whole point. "
"What was the whole point?" Mother asked.
"You let that poor boy die in order to get bait, you monster!"
The cook got furious.
He started towards her with his fist raised... and Mother slapped him hard, right across the face.
I was stunned.
I thought he was going to kill her right then.
But he didn't.
The cook didn't stop at bait either, no.
The sailor...
He went the same way the rat went.
The cook was a resourceful man.
It was a week later that he...
Because of me.
Because I couldn't hold on to a stupid turtle.
It slipped out of my hands and swam away.
And the cook came up and he punched me on the side of my head... and my teeth clacked and I saw stars.
I thought he was going to hit me again... but Mother started pounding on him with her fists... screaming, "Monster, monster!"
She yelled at me to go to the raft.
I thought she was coming with me, or I'd never have...
I don't know why I didn't make her go first.
I think about that every day.
I jumped over and turned back just as the knife came out.
There wasn't anything I could do.
I couldn't look away.
He threw her body overboard.
And then the sharks came.
And I saw what they...
I saw.
The next day, I killed him.
He didn't even fight back.
He knew he had gone too far... even by his own standards.
He'd left the knife out on the bench, and I did to him what he did to the sailor.
He was such an evil man, but worse still, he...
He brought the evil out in me.
And I have to live with that.
I was alone in a lifeboat... drifting across the Pacific Ocean.
And I survived.
Pl: After that, they had no more questions.
The investigators didn't seem to like the story, exactly.
But they thanked me, they wished me well, and they left.
So the stories... both the zebra and the sailor... broke their leg.
And the hyena killed the zebra and the orangutan.
So... the hyena is the cook.
The sailor is the zebra.
Your mother is the orangutan.
And you are... the tiger.
Can I ask you something?
Of course.
I've told you two stories about what happened out on the ocean.
Neither explains what caused the sinking of the ship... and no one can prove which story is true and which is not.
In both stories, the ship sinks... my family dies and I suffer.
True.
So, which story do you prefer'?
The one with the tiger.
That's the better story.
Thank you.
And so it goes with God.
Mamaji was right.
It's an amazing story.
Will you really let me write it?
Of course.
Isn't that why Mamaji sent you here, after all?
My wife is here.
Do you want to stay for dinner?
She's an incredible cook.
I didn't know you had a wife.
And a cat and two children.
So, your story does have a happy ending.
Well, that's up to you.
The story is yours now.
Hmm.
"Mr. Patel's is an astounding story of courage and endurance...
"unparalleled in the history of shipwrecks.
"Very few castaways can claim to have survived so long at sea...
"and none in the company...
"of an adult Bengal tiger. "
Hi, Dad.
Pl: We have a guest.
Let me introduce you.
Hi.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Adita.
Ravi.
Peek-a-boo!
(CRYING) No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to startle you, my little baby.
Shh, Shh, shh.
♪ Hush, little vampire, don't say a word
♪ Papa's gonna bite the head off a bird ♪
A-bitty goo-bah!
I vant to kiss your tush.
Nice, but maybe a little more square footage.
I want a lot of monsters here.
DRACULA:
I'm gonna get you, little Mavis. I'm gonna get you!
What out there?
Oh, we never go out there.
"And then the monsters ran away and were forced into hiding."
"But Harry the Human found them and jumped out from under their bed."
"And burned their clothes and bit their toes!"
"And took their candy!"
Don't take my candy.
Babyclaws, you don't need to be frightened.
I promised your mommy I would protect you forever.

Ha-ha!
I can fly! I can fly!
Look at you! Faster, baby!
Faster!
Whoo-hoo!
Excuse me, sir.
What?
What?
Ow.
I'm okay.
Looks good.
Only monsters can get in?
Oh, absolutely. It's hidden real nicely.
You got 400 acres of haunted forest in front of you.
You got the Land of the Undead on the perimeters.
Any humans daring to even look over there will run away real quick.
But, of course, be smart.
No bonfires, no firework shows.
Yeah, yeah, no, no.
It's time, my darling Martha.
The place we always talked about for Mavis.
No one will ever harm her here.
Yeah, it's a mess back there.
Welcome to Hotel Transylvania!
Human-free since 1898.
Your safest destination. Take an itinerary.
I have personally designed a spectacular schedule of events, all leading to my daughter's birthday extravaganza tomorrow.
We always look forward to coming every year, Count.
We enjoy the safety so much.
Of course. That's why we built it.
Yes, good evening.
(BABBLING) Thank you, Marty.
You look pale, as well.
SUIT OF ARMOR:
Sir, sir, sir!
We have an urgent plumbing issue.
Plumbing?
On it. Mr. Ghouligan!
(GROANING) There is a clogged toilet in room 348.
(ROARING)
It's okay.
We all get stomach aches, Mr. Bigfoot.
Hey, kids, reel it in.
You're only supposed to make Mom and Dad miserable.
Now, now, is that any way to behave?
This is a hotel, not a cemetery.
Sorry, Uncle Drac.
Drac!
How are ya?
Wayne, my old friend! Couldn't wait for this weekend.
Always great to be out of the shadows for a couple days.
The family looks beautiful.
Let me just clean up their filth.
Frankie, my boy!
Look at you!
Still traveling by mail, Mr. Cheapo, huh?
It's not a money thing. I have a plane phobia, okay?
I mean, at any moment, those engines could catch...
Fire!
Yeah, yeah.
"Fire bad." We know.
Augustus, Porridge Head, come on!
Does that look like Frankenstein's head?
Hey, Drac, buddy, what's going on with your cape there?
What do you mean?
Oh!
Who pinched me?
Guilty. You're irresistible.
Yes, very amusing, Invisible Man.
Hello.
Great to "see" you. Never gets old.
(SLAP) Ho-ho-ho.
Missed me. Missed me, missed me, missed me.
Okay, you win.
Hold this bacon. Why am I holding bacon...
Ahh! No!
Here comes the party!
Hello, Murray!
Drac, what's up, buddy?
The sand, Murray, the sand!
Always with the sand.
Whee!
Wolfie!
Wanda!
I love this guy.
He always bringing it full tilt.
You're looking skinny, too. Now that you're just a head.
Okay, you'll pay for that.
So what's up, Drac?
The hotel is looking off the hook.
Hey, guys, watch this.
By the way, you were right about those directions.
Oh, good, good.
Yeah, I took the Tigris through the Nile, and there was absolutely no traffic.
You're kidding me.
Right in my lobby? Drac, I swear, man, I don't run like that.
(SNIGGERING)
I was not the cause of that.
We're ready!
If only Martha were here to see this.
She's always here, Wanda.
Okay, friends, I am so glad you are here to celebrate.
Another birthday for my sweet little Mavis, and another successful year of refuge from them!
These are recent human images our surveillance has uncovered.
They are getting fatter so as to overpower us.
And they are wearing less clothing, allowing more movement to strangle us or cut open our heads and put candy in them.
But they will never find us here.
Evil villain, you will never win!
Okie doke. The fun starts in 30 minutes.
Right now, I have to see my little girl.
She's not so little any more!
EUNICE:
What's going on out there? Are we at the hotel?
Frank, did you book us for a tandem massage?
Did you get us a table at Hunchback's?
You're welcome.
Dad, you said that when I turned 118, I could go out into the world like every other adult that gets to come and go from this hotel.
"But, Mavey Wavey, it's not safe.
Bleh, bleh-bleh." Dad, 30 years ago, you promised.
I remember, we were both eating mice, and you specifically said that you gave me your word.
Do not disturb.
Do not disturb.
Do not disturb.
Do not disturb.
Do not disturb.
Do not disturb.
Do not disturb.
Good morning, Your Eminence. Maid, clean up this room!
It's you. Glad you could make it.
Is she up yet?
Oh, she's up.
She's ready to go. And by "go," I mean go.
As in, go check the world out.
What you gonna do? What you gonna say?
I got it covered.
Please, relax.
Good morning, Mavey Wavey!
Happy birthday, my little mouse!
Thank you, Dad. I know it's my birthday.
I have so much fun planned.
Whoo-hoo!
But first, we go catch some scorpions together, just the two of us, yes, dead-ums?
Dad, please, let me speak.
There's something we have to talk about.
You want to go out into the world.
You can.
Aha! I knew you were gonna say that.
But, Dad, you gave me your word, and you know that I know that a Dracula's word is sacred.
That our trust is the core of our...
Wait, what?
I said you can go. You're just playing with me.
No, no, no, no.
You're old enough to drive a hearse now, you're old enough to make your own choices.
You can go.
Holy rabies!
DRACULA:
Whoa, whoa. Stop. Wait a second, sweetfangs.
Where are you going?
Oh, well, I'm going to paradise, and this is just some stuff that I thought I would need.
Paradise? Yeah, you know.
It's that place out there where you and Mom met.
Auntie Wanda says you two were just like, Zing!
I don't know from "Zing."
Where did you find that card?
In one of your drawers.
Why won't you ever tell me about how you met?
It's actually Hawaii. Ha-what-what?
Look, honey, I know you're excited, but everyone has gone to great lengths to come see you on your birthday.
I know. They always do.
But aren't I getting a little old for these parties?
I love them, but I really want to see new things.
Maybe meet somebody my age.
Come on. No, no, don't do that.
Don't give me the pouty batface.
Okay, there is a human village just a little ways past the cemetery.
You could go there and be back in, like, 30 minutes or so.
It should be plenty for your first time.
(SIGHS) Well, it's not Ha-wee-wee, but I guess it's still technically out there.
Okay, okay, okay!
Thanks for trusting me.
Of course, my little one.
I gave you my word.
Hey, honey!
Look at this!
Hey, guys. You excited about tomorrow?
Not as excited as I am right now.
You're not gonna believe this, but Dad is letting me go out on my own to see a human village!
What?
No! Excuse me.
Drac!
Have you lost it?
Letting your own daughter out there with those horrible humans you always tell us about?
That's why you built this place.
They hate us.
They're vicious. And they're very loud!
Auntie Eunice, maybe they've changed.
I'm just gonna fly down the street and see how it goes.
Okay, honey, be safe.
Bring warm clothes and a sword.
And look out for pitchforks.
Don't you let anyone scoop your brains out, either.
Maybe stay in the shadows. It's more fun to just observe from under a house.
Guys, guys.
She can handle it. She's a Dracula, for Pete's sake.
But seriously, watch out for fire.
Bye, everyone.
Drac, I can't believe how calm you are about her leaving.
I'm proud of you.
Drac?
Drac?
MAVIS:
Whoo-hoo! This is awesome!
There's the cemetery, just like Dad said.
Uh...
Anybody out there?
Vampire.
Bite toes!
Oh!
Everything okay? My name is Mavis Dracula, and I...
Vampire.
Burn clothes. MAVIS:
Burn my clothes?
Really?
Um...
Vampire! We take your candy.
Candy!
I'm friendly.
I really am.
Calm down, now.
Candy.
Please.
I've never hurt anyone. I'm homeschooled.
Is that garlic?
Holy rabies, you're on fire.
Can I do anything?
Dad was right.
Dad was right.
It worked.
Now my baby will be safe forever.
All right, everybody, get back to work now.
DRACULA: Hey. You don't need a mannequin.
Leave the mannequin here.
Where you been?
Why you sneaking around?
Shh.
Quiet. Sweetheart, have you returned so soon?
Oh.
Come in, Dad.
How'd it go?
How was the big world?
How was it out there?
It was okay, Dad.
What?
What's the matter? Dad, you were right.
Humans are awful.
They were everything you said.
They wanted to bite my toes.
Your toes? And they had garlic on bread.
What? Look at me.
I'm getting goose bumps, I'm so scared.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
I hate that you had to see that.
I'm so sorry I doubted you.
I'll never leave here again.
Okay.
Okay.
Look, Daddy's going to make you the bestest birthday ever.
Look what I brought you.
Don't be sad any more.
Remember, this is the year we open Mommy's present for you.
What did she get me?
We'll see. She said never to open until you're 118.
We've waited this long.
You eat your wormcakes. You come down whenever you're ready, honey.
Phew.
Ooh.
What did you do?
What I had to.
Mm-hmm. She'll thank me one day.
Yeah, that's what the guy who shrunk my head said.
Ahh.
Yes, what do you want, a cookie?
You did all right, man.
Phew!
Vampire!
Vampire!
Who are you?
And how did you find this place? Oh, I'm Jonathan.
And I was just mountain climbing with some dudes... (SCREAMING) ...and heard this story about a spooky forest. (BABBLING)
And who's not going to go into a spooky forest, right?
(SCREAMING) So, then I see these goofy-looking dudes on fire-
And I just kind of followed them to this, like, amazing castle.
But, of course, be smart.
No bonfires, no firework shows.
How many of you are there?
Just me. I like to hit it alone.
You meet so many awesome people in the youth hostels.
Hey, speaking of awesome, that cape thing is killing it.
Is there, like, a costume party here?
What have I done?
This is all my fault.
You have to leave.
Oh, no. WOMAN:
Excuse me. One of your piranhas in the lake is very rude.
He ate my sister-in-law.
Be right with you.
Mr. Dracula, we asked for a room with a view of the pool.
The room's fine.
We want to book a massage.
Yes, Swedish.
Shiatsu.
Aromatherapy.
Lower back.
Do you have hot-stone?
We want a massage.
I'll get back to you, Mr. Hydraberg.
I doubt it.
See that you do.
That's Ms. Hydraberg.
Thanks. Yes, nice to see you.
JONATHAN:
Dude, seriously, what's up? It's kind of funky to breathe under here.
Drac.
Hey, Drac.
How'd it go with Mavey?
Hey.
Wow!
This room's kind of small for a big castle.
No bed, but check out these awesome dustpans they give you.
Quiet, you fool.
What weapons are you keeping in this container?
Your pitchforks?
(SNIFFS) Oh!
I can't breathe. It's killing me.
Yeah, definitely due for a fluff and fold.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATES) What is this?
A torture device? A secret mind controller?
You won't read my thoughts.
I won't let you.
Dude, it's just music.
(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)
Ohh! It's taking my soul!
What?
It's a good jam.
Don't be a grandpa. You need to go.
No human has ever entered this castle.
And if someone should see you, the safety of the hotel, the sanctuary, no one would ever come again.
Yeah, go for it.
"Ever come again!"
I love your Dracula voice.
It's so over the top.
And Mavis, if she saw you, she would know that I lied.
Who's Mavis?
Is this her room? I'm good with a roommate.
I had six brothers growing up, sol could totally share.
I can't kill him. It would set monsters back hundreds of years.
One time, in Hamburg, I roomed with this dude who I caught stealing my shampoo.
I said, "Whoa, man," and he threw a flower pot at me, but he was cool.
What are you babbling about?
What?
Whoa.
Check out these awesome costumes. Costumes.
What's this?
Sorry, man. I just can't be without my backpack.
You know, everything I own's in there.
It'll be right here.
Okay, I just... I love my backpack.
JONATHAN: Whoa. Hey, what are you doing?
(CLANGING)
What are you...
What are you doing to my hair?
Stop. Oh, wait, that tickles.
Come on, man.
Check it out.
I'm a Franken-homie.
Yes, hello. Look at me!
This is totally normal, not a problem here.
This is just a monster with me.
Man, everybody stepped it up tonight.
Wait, why are we going to the front door?
Are we leaving? Bonjour, Dracula!
Hey, Sniffy.
What's going on?
(SQUEAKING) What?
(SQUEAKING) No.
Don't be absurd. It's not a human, but Monsieur Dracula.
How ridiculous.
Monsieur.
The devilled lizard fingers.
Devilled lizard fingers?
I asked for spleens-in-blankets.
You ugly fool!
I told you, he doesn't like the lizard fingers!
But you said... (YELLING INCOHERENTLY)
Whoa. Check that costume out.
Wow. Seriously, I just have to ask you: How are you pulling this off?
I mean, it looks so real.
Like, I could just put my hand right through... (GASPING)
What do you think you're doing? She's real.
You're real!
Yeah, and I'll give you a real beating.
(SCREAMS)
Honey, I just didn't know where you were.
We thought you were still out.
Oh, no. I don't know why I ever wanted to leave.
The humans are so boring.
Mavis, honey, are you all right?
Yeah, I think so.
That was weird.
JONATHAN: (GROANING) My head hurts.
Um, who is that?
Who is what?
Oh, that. That is nobody.
Seriously, Dad?
"Dad"? Yeah, I know, Dracula's daughter.
Everyone freaks out at first.
Dracula?
Please don't kill me.
I'm so young. I have so many places I want to see.
I've got tickets to six Dave Matthews Band concerts.
I'm getting out of here.
Shut up already.
It's impossible for me to think with all your noise.
Sorry, Glen.
Wait. Aren't you going to suck my blood?
Classic human paranoia.
Human blood is so fatty, and you never know where it's been.
So, Dracula doesn't drink blood?
No, I use a blood substitute.
Either Near Blood or Blood Beaters.
You can't tell the difference.
So, wow, you're, like, the real Count Dracula.
Like, "I'm Dracula.
Bleh, bleh-bleh."
I've never said that in my life.
"Bleh, bleh-bleh." I don't know where that comes from.
Can I just ask, what exactly is this place?
What is this place?
It's a place I built for all those monsters out there, lurking in the shadows, hiding from the persecution of humankind.
A place for them and their families to come to and be themselves.
A place void of torches, pitchforks, angry mobs.
A place of peace, relaxation and tranquility.
Cool.
Yes, exactly. "A hotel for monsters." Way to sum it up.
Okay, hop on my back.
We're leaving. Oh, man, you're a bat now.
I always wanted to fly.
What's it like?
This is insane.
Wait. Wait, I want to stay.
Can Frankenstein sign my costume?
Can I meet the Invisible Man?
Hey, if I stuck my hand in the Invisible Man's mouth, would it disappear?
MAVIS:
Hi. Mavey! What are you doing, my sweet little blood orange?
Our friend was just leaving.
Yeah, he was flying me out the window.
This guy, he's so funny.
Look, you have something on your face.
Play along if you ever want to see your precious backpack.
Whoa. So, wait, you didn't have any clothes on when you were a bat?
Or were they bat-sized?
Who exactly is that?
Hmm.
Honeybat. You see, it's your birthday.
And you know I want you to have the bestest, specialest party of your life.
So, well, I needed some help.
You needed help?
Well, look, I am very good, but I thought it would be even more bestest, specialest if someone closer to your age helped plan the party.
You're my age?
Sure.
Well, how old are you?
118. One hundred and...
(COUGHS) Yeah, I'm 121.
Really?
Mm-hmm. You see?
Everything is very, very normal.
I'm throwing a party, and he's helping.
Sir, there's an emergency.
Not now. Can't you see we're in the middle of something very normal here?
Wait, what's going on here?
There's an emergency in your precious hotel, and you're not running to fix it?
Why?
Is it because of him? Whoa, look at my face.
No, precious bones, it's not because of him.
Good. Then go check on the emergency, and I'll keep him company.
No! Anything but that!
What? I mean, because he needs time to plan.
And if you're keeping him company, then he's not planning.
He is company-keeping, and then the plan, it's...
Mm-hmm.
Good one.
Shut up!
Okay. So, maybe if you're not planning later, we can hang out.
Sounds good.
You hear that? It sounds good.
So you will hang out.
See you later, my honey.
Lovely. Okay, you're not hanging out.
Because you are leaving.
But the opposite, you said.
SUIT OF ARMOR:
But, sir, the emergency.
Boy, that kid smelt.
Where are we going?
Just getting rid of you through a secret tunnel so she does not see us.
So, can I ask you a question?
Is that real, about the garlic thing?
Yes, I cannot have it.
My throat swells.
Huh.
Wooden stake to the heart?
Ah.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm a little lost. Yes, I know it's your honeymoon.
I apologize.
Go back to doing what you were doing.
(KISSING) DRACULA:
I'm not down here much. It's meant to be an exit if humans ever invade.
So, I'm, like, the first human here, huh?
That's really cool. Oh, boy.
I think this is it.
What's happening? I'm terribly sorry.
My mistake.
Oh, man.
This place is amazing.
Okay, I could really use some silence right now.
All right, third time's a...
Drac.
Yes, Frankie?
Hey, buddy, what you been doing?
Don't move. Never mind that.
What you been doing?
We wanted to practice our big number for Mavis's party, and then these losers wouldn't get off the bandstand.
Okay.
Put down Zombie Mozart,
Did you get to rehearse at all, Zombie Beethoven?
(GROANS IN 5TH SYMPHONY) Listen, Drac, we wanted to play something, like old times.
We even thought maybe you'd sing with us.
Come on, fellas.
You know that I haven't sung in public since Martha.
Yeah, but we just thought how much, you know, Mavis would love it.
I said no! Don't ask me again!
Okay. Now, let's hug the zombies.
Let's all make up.
Wow. He really scared you.
I wasn't scared.
I was being polite, okay?
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were planning. I never caught your name.
My name's Mavis.
Mavis? That's a pretty neat name.
Yeah, my mom picked it.
So, are you going to tell me your name?
Me? My name?
Good question.
Well, obviously, I'm Frankenstein.
No, you're not. Frankenstein is my uncle over there.
The gentleman hugging Zombie Mozart.
Right. Of course, he's your uncle.
Well, see, I'm not "the" Frankenstein.
I'm his cousin, Johnnystein.
Johnnystein?
Who is that?
Are these monsters going to kill me?
Not as long as they think you're a monster.
Huh?
That's kind of racist.
Is he making fun of me?
No, no. Of course he's not, because he's...
He's your cousin, Johnnystein.
Yes, yes, yes. I don't have no cousin.
No, no, you do.
He's your sixth cousin, three times removed.
On your right arm's side.
You have a cousin? Frank, if your arm could talk, he would tell you that the original owner of your arm had a brother.
Who married a woman.
Who was... (GAGS) For strangling a pig.
I have pig-strangling blood in my arm?
That's kind of cool.
So, what brings you here, Johnny?
Wah! What was that?
Oh, sorry. I should really clear my throat before I speak.
Anyway, what brings you here?
Oh.
Uh. Party planner.
Yes, I have recruited Mr. Stein here to help me with Mavis's birthday party.
Wait a minute, you asked someone to help you?
Captain Control Freak? It's Count...
And yes, I thought having a Mavis contemporary would be useful.
Yeah, he totally needed a fresher perspective.
Okay, Johnny, Mr. Tight Coffin over here was planning to have these powdered lame-os play at the party.
So, anyways, we thought we could liven things up a bit.
Whoa!
You all play?
♪ Where did the time go, girl? ♪
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, guys. Stop.
That's cute, but kind of old school.
Yes, thank you, Johnny.
You got to totally tempo things up.
Here, let me show you.
JONATHAN: Werewolf man, give me a jam!
Two, three, four!
♪ Vampire girl with the fangy fangs
♪ Hair real cute with the bangy bangs
♪ Little princess gonna be a queen
♪ Legal bat lady turning 118 ♪
CROWD: 118!
Say 118!
118!
Yeah!
Awesome.
I am so blown away right now.
I think my cuz is gonna make this the best party ever!
Yeah! Maybe he can find a way to get me some chicks.
We should do a dance contest!
We're not doing any of that.
We've got to stay on schedule, all right?
All right, Dad, all right.
Johnny, you're coming, too.
I don't know.
Is it cool with Dracula?
N-27.
G-61.
Bingo!
Bingo!
How dare you. Do you know what doctor made me?
I didn't do that.
Circles?
Hands?
Vomit.
The Vomit?
The Throw Up.
No.
Nothing?
Emptiness?
Glasses?
Glasses? Glasses shaking?
Glasses shaking sideways!
Through The Looking-Glass?
GRIFFIN:
I didn't do that.
FLY: And pull it back. And up.
And push.
And twist.
And back. And up.
And twist.
No.
Don't copy that. And back. And up.
Let me get a bubonic moose nose omelet with cockroach paste and mouse jelly.
Bonjour, Monsieur Dracula!
May I make you an omelet?
No, no, no, no.
What? Esmeralda, you smell it again?
(SQUEAKING)
Human?
I am hungry. Johnny, you've been to the Taj Mahal?
Come on. No monster's been to the Taj.
Man, I wish I could go there.
You know what?
You heard the man!
How did you deal with the mobs?
Yeah, it does get pretty crazy in the summer.
But, you know, you just got to roll.
He just rolls.
That's cool that he rolls. Yes, yes, cool.
Look, love droppings, I brought you a bagel with your favorite, scream cheese.
(SCREAMING) Holy rabies.
Thanks, Dad. Johnny, try some scream cheese, it's awesome.
Oh, cool.
(SCREAMING) But I'm scream cheese intolerant.
So, polite pass.
Yes, of course you are.
Johnny, can we party-plan talk for a minute?
What are you doing? If they find out you are human, they'll go bat poop!
Relax. No one suspects anything.
The only thing that looks weird is how much whispering you're doing.
Just wrap it up.
You will say you are going in the pool and act excited.
And then you will say you hurt your back and you have to leave.
Here come good times!
Whoo!
Oh, dudes.
Oh, my back. I'm on your back!
No, no.
He said, "Oh, my back."
Get on my back!
Let's do it.
Aw, here we go.
Chicken fight!
Push them off! ALL:
We got you, Johnny.
You're going down.
Whoa. Oh, yeah, we'll see, "Mavey Wavey."
Okay, calm down with the fight chickens!
Everyone, stop the roughhousing!
EUNICE: Frank, if you hurt yourself...
I got it, honey.
The Stein boys are bred for this kind of thing.
(GRIFFIN SCREAMS)
Kids, Why'd you do that? I was just in the pool.
The water's cold.
Johnny.
Your makeup. Your makeup!
Climb out.
Oh, man.
I guess the Count wanted to go for a swim.
Cannonball!
DRACULA:
Oh, you messed up, baby.
You messed up big-time. I told you to take it down.
You'll ruin my hotel if they find out.
Well, maybe you're just jealous that people are finally having fun at this place.
Oh, that? That was not fun.
Everyone running, jumping, swimming with no order.
That was the opposite of fun.
Do you even know what fun is? I invented fun!
Boy, the wrong people get to be immortal.
Look at me.
You remember nothing of this encounter.
You have no memory of this place or the monsters you met.
Now go and never return.
Wait, never return to the hotel?
What? You were supposed to forget the hotel.
I just used my powers to erase your memory.
I looked straight into your eyes.
Huh. Oh, maybe it's the contact lenses.
The what?
These little plasticky doodads that help me see better.
Here, let me just try and get them out real quick.
Oh, that is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen!
Almost got it.
Stop doing that.
Please stop doing that!
Fingers away from the eyeballs!
Enough!
Listen to me.
You are never to return here.
You are to stay away and never tell humans about this place.
Or I will track you down and suck every ounce of blood from your body until you look like a deflated whoopee cushion!
Be gone.
Can't believe I'm leaving, man.
That could have been so great!
Dude ruined everything.
Suck my blood. I should have just said, "I'm staying, old man!"
Give him a Bruce Lee kick.
Boom!
Right in the...
Oh, my God.
Count Dracula.
Please don't kill me.
Follow me.
Oh. No, no, Mavis, I can't.
I have to leave.
You sure?
It'll be fun.
He's not gonna see me, is he?
Wow, would you look at the view from up here?
You could almost see Budapest.
Who-da-pest? Is that near Ha-wi-fi?
Huh? Oh, you mean Hawaii.
Yeah, that place is a knockout.
I just went to a music festival there.
A human music festival?
Uh, I believe so.
So, did they all bite your toes and shove garlic bread in your face?
No.
Well, one dude took a bigger bite out of my energy bar than I expected, but I blame that on the heat.
It's amazing. You've been everywhere.
Well, you know, what's the alternative?
Just staying at home, never exploring, never seeing what's out there?
I'm only gonna be 121 once, right?
Got to live it. Yeah.
Oh, man.
The sunrise from here must be amaz...
Ow. Oh, I'm sorry.
Man, you've probably never even seen a sunrise, have you?
No, not really.
Why? Come on.
Watch.
Ahh.
Ahh. Didn't I tell you guys we'd have fun in here?
Is this not the best?
Yeah, I'm working up a nice sweat.
When's that Johnny kid gonna be done party planning?
He's a great hang.
Yeah, he's an animal.
And it was so nice seeing Mavis laughing and hitting it off with him.
Who's hitting what off?
Please. Mavis could never be with someone of his kind.
I'm sorry?
"His kind"?
You're saying our kind's not good enough for you,
"Your Lordship"?
No, no, no! Frank, I didn't...
I meant that she wouldn't be into someone with such red, curly hair.
Uh, what's wrong with red, curly hair?
Why are you getting upset? I have red curly hair!
Well, how was I supposed to know that?
This is the most incredible thing I've ever seen.
Johnny?
Look, settle down, fellas.
This is all a moot point because Johnny, he left.
Wait a minute.
He left? Yes. He decided he didn't like Mavis, or any of us.
Hi.
Hmm.
I can't believe you stuck around, man.
You don't get it. Bad things are coming your way.
I got to get my thoughts together.
Okay. You see these tables?
You can spend the entire day pulling them out and placing them, party planner.
Fantastic.
I'm trapped here.
Enough!
Enough!
Stop! Go to a corner, you're in a timeout!
Timeout?
Okay.
Table 57, please move to position 23.
That is cool.
DRACULA:
Face the wall.
17 to 48. 16 to 47. 19 to 50.
Awesomeness.
Just let me do my work.
29 to 35.
42 to 18. 10 to 44.
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.
39 to 24.
36 up!
Whoa!
31 to 19.
24 up!
Seven to 25. 14 to 30.
Where'd you go, grandpa?
Don't freak out, gravity face.
Eat my dust, gray fangs!
56 and 43, to my side.
Prepare to cry, Billy Backpack.
That's how we do it!
Half-pipe, baby!
Yes.
Keep smelling. You catch the human, and then I will make human potpie!
DRACULA: 27, 45, 65, 76, 48, block his path.
Whoa-ho!
Oh, come on now, dude man!
(MURMURING)
Haha!
I got you, buddy.
Do not disturb!
(LAUGHS)
Did you see that? Who is that guy, Sir Breaks-a-lot?
Oh, boy, I have to say, that was fun.
Okay?
The fun you were talking about earlier?
Nailed it! Johnny?
Quasimodo!
Mavis?
Why are you still up?
The sun is out. It could kill you, my honeyguts.
I couldn't sleep.
Do you know where Johnny went?
I don't know.
He...
Why do you want to know?
Oh! Uh... Do you like him?
What?
Pfft, no.
Come on, Dad. He's so weird and awkward.
It's like, are you an idiot or do you know you're adorable?
Eh...
Hold that.
Do you have a location on Quasimodo?
Yes, sir. They're heading through the lobby, towards the kitchen.
I need them stopped immediately.
Is that clear?
Yes, quite.
What is the meaning of this?
Let me pass!
Why did that hurt me?
Look, honey, there's no falling in love at your age.
Mom was my age.
Eunice says Mom kissed you first 'cause you were too scared to make the first move.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Forget about me and Mom and kissing.
Dad, at some point, I'm going to get married.
I can't be here forever.
What? Why not? You're barely out of your training fangs.
Ha-ha!
Quasi wins again!
When you bump with the hump, you land on your rump!
But why all the sudden interest?
Every time we used to talk about love, it was always,
"Ooh, Dad, that's gross,"
and "Ooh, Dad, I don't want to know about that."
Sir, he made it into the kitchen.
He what?
What do I pay you for?
I'm sorry, honey.
He doesn't pay me.
Before you kill me, can I please talk to my backpack one more time?
I don't want to leave anything unresolved.
Bonjour, Monsieur Dracula!
Shut your hump hole. Now you are helping him?
What is it with you and this human?
He is not human.
He's a Stein! That's right, little man, I'm a Stein!
If he is a monster, let him scare Esmeralda!
The mouse? Pfft!
Without a doubt.
Okay.
(SCREAMS) A human!
A human!
Monsieur Dracula has brought a human into the... (MUFFLED) Esmeralda, help me.
Hey, thanks for saving me back there.
That guy's crazy! Trying to eat me.
That's only happened to me one other time.
This weird dude at a Slipknot concert.
There's something I need to show you.
JONATHAN:
Wow. Hey, are we at a funeral right now?
Oh, wait, no, it's your bed.
So creepy and cool.
(GASPS) Wow!
I know her! I've seen that picture at the ruins of Lubov.
That's my favorite castle.
There's a whole legend around that lady.
The Lady Lubov.
The story is that a lonely count met her by chance, and they say that no two souls were ever more meant for each other.
Eventually, they settled down at Castle Lubov and had a child.
But then, a horrible tragedy happened.
A fire started mysteriously one night, and it killed both of them.
When I was at the castle, I could still feel their powerful love.
They say it's as if a soul is still trapped in the ruins themselves.
The legend is wrong.
It was only the wife that died.
Oh.
And it was no mystery who killed her.
She was killed by your kind!
Vampire!
Honey?
Go hide.
Vampire!
(MARTHA SCREAMING) DRACULA:
(MAVIS CRYING) They are the real monsters.
I built this place for my love, to protect her child.
As a father, you do everything to keep your family safe, even if you have to break their trust.
But now, Mavis has feelings for you.
What?
Awesome.
It's all right. You are a good one.
If the world was different, maybe it would be possible.
Drac, this is the 21st century.
People aren't the same as they were back then.
Can you tell me for certain that if we came out in the open, everyone would accept us?
No.
You're right. I'll go for good this time.
You can just say I had some emergency, or the gremlin lady ate me or something.
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't want to ruin her birthday party.
You can sneak out after it's all done.
I'm sorry.
The last thing I wanted was to hurt her.
You know, you're not the smoothest Frankenstein, but you'd make a great vampire.
For real? 'Cause I think I kind of got your hypno-eyes down.
Oh, boy, here we go.
Let me see it.
Beware! For you are in my power.
I command you to be the werewolf man!
(HOWLS)
Someone scratch me, I have fleas.
'Cause he's a wolf, he'd get those.
Yeah, no, don't explain it.
I didn't order a wake-up call.
WOMAN: Count Dracula arranged it for all the rooms.
(SCREAMS) Where's the snooze button?
There will be no snoozing.
Ooh, yeah, perfecto.
(DANCE BEAT PLAYING) ♪ Girl
♪ I can't believe it's your big night
♪ You ate your frogs, now the party's so right
♪ Where did the time go, girl?
♪ And, girl, you used to suck a binky

JONATHAN: Wow. You look beautiful.
Thanks. Thanks for the party.
Yeah, you like my little touches?
It's amazing.
Terrific party. You really outdid yourself, Drac.
Got to be the best one I've been to in 500 years.
(ROARING) Sorry, big man.
Uh, Mavis?
I'm crazily scared right now.
Maybe that's a good thing.
How could you?
After I shared my pain with you?
But, no...
Dad, it was just a kiss. No, you're not allowed to kiss.
Dad, I'm allowed to do things.
I'm not 83 any more.
I'm allowed to like people, or go see the world again.
What? You saw it! You said you didn't like it!
Maybe I want to give the village another chance.
I just need to learn, you know, just how to roll with it, like Johnny does.
No, no, you can't go to the village again.
Maybe you can make them see that we could be friends.
No, that isn't possible.
Well, you can't be sure. It's all in how you present yourself.
No, that won't make a difference!
How do you know?
Because it just won't!
Why? Why won't it? Because that village doesn't really exist!
What do you mean "doesn't exist"?
FRANKENSTEIN:
What did you do? I did what I had to do.
What was it?
What exactly did you have to do?
I...
I built the town.
The staff put it all together.
The zombies dressed up as the townspeople.
Please.
I... If you really went out there and something happened to you,
I just couldn't live with myself.
But you can live with this?
Lying to me? Tricking me?
Keeping me here forever when you knew my dream was to go.
(MUFFLED) Liar!
Liar! Oil?
English, please.
Your voice is really annoying.
Wait, I speak frozen.
He says, "Dracula has brought a human into the hotel."
(CROWD GASPING)
A human?
(MUFFLED SPEECH) He says, "There is ze human."
He has a French accent.
(GASPING)
Johnny's not a human.
He's my right arm's cousin. He's lying.
GRIFFIN:
Yeah.
(MUFFLED SPEECH) He says, "it's a long story."
Hey, wait, no!
Get off me!
(ESMERALDA SQUEAKING)
(MUFFLED SPEECH) He says, "Behold ze human."
I don't believe it.
Is it true?
Are you a human?
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
I don't care.
I still want to be with you.
Uh...
Well, tough. 'Cause I don't want to be with you.
Because you're a monster.
Goodbye.
Please don't hurt me!
This is all your fault!
We're getting out of here.
I'm never coming back here.
I thought I smelt a human.
"Human-free"?
Oh.
Here he comes. Count Crock-ula.
I'm just glad my eyes are stitched shut, 'cause I don't even want to...
Mavis, honey, are you in there?
Mavis?
Mavis? Mavis, where are you?
Mavis?
Dad, can you do me a favor?
Yes, yes, of course, darling.
Anything.
No, no, no, no.
No, I won't do that.
There's too much I want you to remember.
You were right, Dad.
The humans hate us.
Sweetheart, there are so many eligible monsters out there.
What is it?
MARTHA: "Two lonely bats crashed in the night."
"They felt a Zing.
Love at first sight."
"They knew right then they would be husband and wife."
"For a Zing only happens once in your life."
"Your Zing will come, my love."
"Cherish it." "Love, Mommy."
I thought we Zinged, Dad.
(GASPS) You and Johnny?
I guess it was only me.
But you should be happy, Dad.
There's no reason for me to leave.
I have no more dreams.
I'm just like you now.
Martha, what have I done?
Where is my bill? Over here.
I'm next.
I'm checking out.
Take my key!
What is this minibar charge?
Honey, the kids threw the minibar out the window.
And that's our fault?
Well... Excuse me!
Pardon, yeah.
Excuse me, I got a couple of people to express mail.
DRACULA:
Friends, please, stop. It's too late, rat-bat!
Please, I'm begging you.
I need you to help me find Johnny.
The human?
He could've killed us! He touched my guitar!
He put his hand in my mouth to see if it would disappear.
He let me eat his scooter!
(CROWD GASPS) I know I lied.
I was wrong.
But you have to believe this:
Johnny wasn't a bad guy.
The truth is, I don't even know if humans are bad any more.
Frank, come on, buddy.
You understand. EUNICE: He's not talking to you.
First you tell us humans are bad, now they're good.
What else? Up is down, cold is hot, gremlins don't smell.
Hey!
I really liked Johnny, cousin or no.
He told fun stories.
I think they Zinged.
They Zinged? But I got in the way.
You only Zing once in your life.
Oy, now you're short-circuiting.
I don't care!
Well, what are we doing?
Let's get Johnny.
Come on!
Yeah, let's do it!
Yeah!
GRIFFIN: Okay, okay, where am I going?
The human world, before Johnny's gone forever.
But what about the sun?
I don't know.
I'll just have to roll.
He just rolls.
DRACULA:
So we follow his boot-prints. When they run out, that's where you come in, Wayne.
Me?
Yes, I knew something would fall out of that backpack.
Yowch!
That stinks!
Work your magic. Wait, you want me to track the smell?
No. My sniffing tracking days are way behind me.
Do you know how many diapers I've changed?
How many number twos have destroyed this thing?
Hey!
Take it easy!
Watch it! Sit.
Smell.
Not me, the shirt!
The shirt! Do any of your kids still respect you?
Mm, give me a second.
Oh, yeah.
Winnie! Front and center!
He got into a car.
A '86 Fiat. It needs a little transmission work, but otherwise okay.
It drove through town to the airport.
Flight 497.
8:00 a.m. departure.
That's in 15 minutes.
Seat 23A.
He ordered the vegetarian meal.
Okay, thank you, cutie.
Now, all of you, go back to your mother!
High five!
MURRAY: Lots of sheep!
What? Now there's no sheep in the road.
Let's go. That was pretty sick, man.
You eat lamb chops, it's the same thing.
We don't have time for this.
Look, a human.
Welcome to Transylvania!
That was trippy.
Monster Festival?
Did they know we were coming?
They like us?
Excuse me?
Do you know the best way to the airport?
Yes, fellow Dracula.
There's only one way.
Bleh, bleh-bleh.
But it's all blocked.
We'll never make it in time.
You should have left an hour earlier.
Bleh, bleh-bleh. I do not say "Bleh, bleh-bleh."
All right, let's just run through it on foot.
Drac, this'll protect you.
Bleh, bleh-bleh.
Imagine if that guy knew he was talking to the real Drac.
He'd run for the hills!
Hold it, now.
Hold it, now. That sounds spot on.
But the only way they'd know the real us is if we show the real us.
This could work. You mean, like, scare them?
We haven't scared people in centuries.
I don't even think I have it in me any more.
I got nothing.
I really got nothing.
Fire!
Fire!
I'm trying to scare you!
The real Frankenstein!
We know!
We love you!
Listen, before anything else, down there's the real Dracula!
All right.
Continue. Drac's daughter's in love, and he's got to get to the airport!
And he can't get through this crowd!
Why doesn't he fly?
The sun, you idiot.
He's a vampire.
That's right. Thank you, Monster Nerd.
So, people, if you really are our friends, clear a path for the man!
Okay. All Draculas, line up.
Bleh, bleh-bleh.
Everyone else, lift the capes.
Protect our friend.
It's all for you, buddy.
Go ahead.
Good luck! Go get 'em!
Go, Drac, go!
Go, Drac!
Go, Drac!
Go, Drac!
Go, Drac!
Go get 'em! Go, Drac, go!
We love you, Dracula!
There's no choice.
Ouch.
Ouch, ouch, ouch.
Okay.
Jonathan. Jonathan, can you hear me?
Tell me, do you dream of being a vampire?
This is how we're represented.
Unbelievable.
Jonathan.
Jonathan. Can you hear me?
Whoa!
Bat!
Wait, it's talking.
Dracula?
(INAUDIBLE)
Huh? Dracula. I can't understand you.
What? My hand's in a tan shoe?
What? Japan's eating lamb stew?
Hey, do you know you're smoking?
Oh.
Pardon me.
Sorry, excuse me.
What the heck? How'd a bat get up this high?
Folks, I'm gonna turn on the seat belt sign.
While we hear a special announcement for my dear friend Jonathan.
Dracula? My dear boy, I have made a terrible mistake.
I was trying to keep my baby to myself, because I knew I would always protect her.
But I realize now, children need to discover things for themselves.
They'll stumble and fall, laugh and cry, but such is life.
The truth is, you and Mavis are meant to be.
You Zinged.
If she must give her trust to someone else,
I'm thankful that it is you, Jonathan.
I hope you can hear me and forgive me-
Okay, folks, we're going to make a quick turnaround to refuel, and then we'll be back on our way.
Quit your whining!
(GROANS)
I'm fine. I'm just a little sunburnt.
Honey,
I always thought the worst thing ever would be seeing you go.
But the worst is seeing you unhappy.
Mavey, I want you to live your life.
(SIGHS) I don't know how I'm supposed to do that.
You know, Mommy already gave you her birthday present.
Can I now give you mine?
What do I need this for?
Oh, it comes with an accessory.
You?
You. Why are you back?
'Cause you're my Zing, Mavis.
I'm your Zing?
But you told me you hate monsters.
Yeah, well, I was afraid your dad was gonna suck all the blood out of my body if I didn't say that.
I wouldn't have...
No, he's right, I would have done that.
Dad. I was wrong, Devil-chops.
Do you really mean it, Dad?
Go make your own paradise.
Can we try that kiss over again?
(CHUCKLES) I think we can.
Sorry.
I just... I got to get used to that.
Go.
(MUFFLED) Stop!
(HIP HOP BEAT PLAYING) ♪ I thought I found a love but she was just a fling ♪ And then I met a girl and felt a different thing

No, no, I just came closer to hear you better.
Come on, just give it a try.
All right, maybe just a little.

I didn't do that.
Five, four, three two, one.
Ready or not, here I come.
Hey, Dad?
Dad!
You'll stay with Aunt May and Uncle Ben for a little while.
- I wanna go with you.
- No.
Doesn't like crust on his sandwiches and he likes to sleep with a little light on.
- Mary.
Come on, come on.
- Oh, God.
Dad.
Be good.
Sorry.
Morning, Flash.
Good morning, Parker.
Hey.
It's Peter, right?
I really like your photos.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
Listen are you busy Friday night?
Cool.
Can you take pictures of my boyfriend's car?
You know, I really wanna frame a good one for his birthday.
That's really nice of you. Wow, that's such a nice thought.
Yeah, I'll have a look at the old...
- The old schedule.
- Okay.
Parker.
- Yes, sir?
- You want to keep that skateboard?
- Yeah.
- Keep it off the ground.
- Sure.
Yeah. - Wheels up.
- That's it.
- Okay.
Eat it!
Eat it!
Eat it!
Eat it!
Eat it!
Eat it!
Eat it!
Eat it!
Eat your vegetables, Gordon.
Come on!
Come on!
Hey, Parker, come on.
Get a picture of this.
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.
- Come on.
- Gordon, don't eat it.
Take the picture.
Put him down, Flash.
Take the picture.
Put him down, Eugene!
Hey, man.
Come on!
Get up, Parker!
Get up!
Come on!
Come on!
Get up!
Still not taking the picture.
Stay down, Parker!
Who wants one more?
- One more!
- Flash!
Flash we still on for after school today?
My house, 3:30?
I hope you did homework.
Last time, I was disappointed in you.
- Okay, move.
- No, how about we go to class?
How about it?
Whatever.
I thought that was great what you did.
It was stupid but it was great.
You should go to the nurse.
You might have a concussion.
What's your name?
You don't know my name?
No, I know your name.
I want to know if you know your name.
Peter.
- Parker.
Peter Parker.
- Okay.
Okay, good.
I'd still go to the nurse though.
You're Gwen, right?
Gwen Stacy.
All right.
Hey.
I'm making spaghetti and meatballs tonight.
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.
Since when don't you like spaghetti and meatballs, huh?
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?
What happened to your face?
I'm all right.
Just- - I fell, skating.
It's all right.
Ben Parker, don't you even think about leaving that filthy box in my kitchen.
My bowling trophies.
Oh, well, then, by all means leave that box in my kitchen.
- What happened to you?
- He fell.
Why you kids ride those things, I'll never know.
Because it's stupid and dangerous.
Remember when we were stupid?
No.
- Trust me, we were.
- All right.
Good to know.
Where's the flood?
Follow me.
I'll show you.
- You serious?
- Yes.
All right.
It's the condenser tray.
Too much water for the condenser tray or the heat exchange tubing.
This has got to be the fill line.
That's the only thing that makes any sense.
Can you fix it?
No, not tonight.
I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.
Good deal. And meanwhile, put this on your face.
How's the other guy look?
Come on.
I know a right cross when I see one.
Yes or no?
Do I have to call somebody's father?
No, no.
All right.
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.
I pity the poor kid who'd have to suffer her wrath.
Before you come up, see if...
-...there's anything else worth saving.
- Okay.
- Plumbers don't fix appliances.
- Yes, they do.
They fix pipes and pump things.
If you ask them to--
I forgot all about that thing.
It was your dad's.
- Yeah.
- He asked us to keep it safe.
He saw it in the window of that leather shop over on 9th Avenue.
He was 19.
What does a 19-year-old kid need with a briefcase?
And guess who sold it to him.
- I don't know.
- Your mother.
That's how they met.
He asked you to keep this safe?
There's nothing in here.
Have you looked?
There's nothing here.
Your father was a very secretive man, Peter.
Yeah, I know.
Who's that?
Do you know who that is?
Some guy who worked with your dad, I guess.
Just take this off the table, all right?
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.
- Now.
- All right.
Go on.
I need you to be a good boy.
Where are you going?
There's something your mom and I have to do.
What is this?
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."
Yeah, one sec, one sec.
Come in.
You okay?
- Yeah.
What's up?
- Oh, my God.
You look just like him.
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.
Listen I don't have much education.
You know that, Peter.
Hell, I stopped being able to help with your homework when you were 10.
What I'm trying to say is I know it's been rough for you without your dad.
And I know we don't talk much about them.
- Yeah, it's all right.
- No, it is not all right.
I wish I could change it, but I can't.
Curt Connors.
That's the name of the guy in the picture with your dad.
They worked together for years and they were close.
But after that night, we never saw him again.
He never even called.
Not once.
Go figure.
She's pretty.
Uncle Ben.
What?
You're a pretty great dad.
Excuse me.
What?
Can I help you?
I don't know.
I'm here to see...
-... Dr. Connors.
- Right.
You'll find yourself to the left.
You are here for the internship?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
You'll find your badge to the left.
Having trouble finding yourself?
No.
Yeah, I got it.
Okay Mr. Guevara.
Welcome to Oscorp.
Born from the mind of our founder, Norman Osborn the Oscorp Tower houses 108 floors of innovation.
Our scientific minds are pushing the boundaries of defense, biomedical and chemical technologies.
Welcome to Oscorp.
I'm Gwen Stacy, a senior at Midtown Science and head intern to Dr. Connors.
I'll be with you for the duration of your visit.
That's the rule.
Remember that...
-...all will be fine.
- Come on!
- If you forget that--
- Listen!
Look, listen.
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here.
Just tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here!
My name's Rodrigo!
I guess I don't need to tell you what happens if you forget.
Shall we?
Come around this way.
Good afternoon, Gwen.
Dr. Connors.
Welcome.
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.
Yes, in case you're wondering, I'm a southpaw.
I'm not a cripple I'm a scientist, and the world's foremost authority on herpetology.
That's reptiles, for those of you who don't know.
Like the Parkinson's patient who watches on in horror as her body slowly betrays her, or the man with macular degeneration whose eyes grow dimmer each day, I long to fix myself.
I want to create a world without weakness.
Anyone care to venture a guess just how?
Yes.
Stem cells?
Promising.
But the solution I'm thinking of is more radical.
- No one?
- Cross-species genetics.
Person gets Parkinson's when the brain cells that produce dopamine start to disappear.
But a zebra fish has the ability to regenerate cells on command.
If you could give this ability to the woman you're talking about, that's that.
She's curing herself.
Yeah, you just have to look past the gills on her neck.
And you are...?
He's one of Midtown Science's...
-...best and brightest.
- Really?
Second in his class.
- Second?
- Yeah.
Sure about that?
I'm pretty sure.
I'm afraid duty calls.
I'll leave you in the more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.
Nice meeting you all.
If you'd like to gather round.
Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.
Our planet's tree of life is immense.
At Oscorp's...
-... Cross-Species Division...
- Hi.
What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
I don't.
I was gonna say I work here but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that I don't.
You following me?
No, I'm not following you, no.
I had no idea you worked here.
Why would you be here?
I just snuck in because...
I love science.
- You love it.
- I'm passionate about it.
So you snuck in--?
- I have to lead this tour group.
- I know.
I'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.
- I promise you I won't.
- Stay with the group.
All right, guys?
I'm gonna take you to the bioreactor room now.
Sorry.
Yo.
Sorry.
We received the results from the mRNA sequences this morning.
They were disappointing.
Define "disappointing."
Another dead end.
It's the decay rate algorithm.
- And this is to be expected.
- Expected?
You said you were close.
We are close, but it's gonna take time.
He doesn't have time.
Norman Osborn is dying, Dr. Connors.
Save him.
Or we'll both lose our heads.
All right, give me the badge.
Give it to me.
Sorry.
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.
I didn't mean to do that.
I didn't mean to...
I didn't...
I didn't...
Get your hand off her!
I'm trying to get my...
Are you kidding?
I'm sorry.
Are you kidding me?
- Hey, get him, Rudy!
- Hey!
Ma".
I'm sorry!
Man, are you all right?
- Take him down!
- Come on.
Get him, man!
Get him!
No, man, no.
Not my board.
Please, dude, don't--
Sorry!
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Coney Island, next stop.
Next and final stop, Coney Island.
Hey.
Hey.
HEY-
Sorry. I'm late.
- I got--
- We've been so worried.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Watch out!
That's a fly, Peter.
Yeah.
I'm so sorry I kept you guys UP-
I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible and I'm hungry.
Meatloaf.
Drinking?
What's this?
I don't think so.
This is your meatloaf.
This beats all other meat loafs.
Something is very wrong.
Yeah.
Nobody likes your meatloaf.
I got it.
He took the frozen macaroni and cheese.
I noticed that.
Why didn't you tell me you didn't like my meatloaf?
You could have said that to me 37 years ago.
How many meat loafs have I made for you?
Peter.
What are you doing?
'M...
Homework.
Be careful.
Sure.
Dr. Connors.
You don't remember me.
I--
The intern from the other day.
Yeah, yeah.
That's right, yeah.
I'm sure you're very nice, but this is a home.
I ask you to make an appointment with my office.
I'm Richard Parker's son.
Peter?
I'm afraid I can't help you much.
I don't know why they left or where they were going.
Good reflexes.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- I read your book.
Yeah.
It's something, you know.
So you really think...
-...it's possible, cross-species genetics?
- Yes, of course.
Your father and I were mocked for our theories.
Not just in the community at large, but at Oscorp, as well.
They called us mad scientists.
And then your father bred the spiders and everything changed.
The results were beyond encouraging.
They were spectacular.
We were gonna change the lives of millions.
Including my own.
Then it was over.
He was gone.
Took his research with him.
And I knew without him, I...
I----
I was angry.
So I stayed away from you and your family.
And for that, I'm truly sorry.
Say...
Say it worked.
Say you got it to work.
Like, how much would the foreign species take over?
What could the side effects be?
It's hard to say, considering no subject survived.
The problem was always--
The decay rate algorithm?
- Right.
- Right.
Can I...?
Of course.
Extraordinary.
How did you come up with this?
Peter, how about coming to see me at the Tower...
-...one day after school?
- Yeah.
Thank you.
You did that on purpose, Flash!
I should've. You better watch your back.
Hey.
All right?
Give it up.
Come on, man.
One sec.
- Come on, man.
- Why don't you take it from me?
That's right.
Take it.
Go ahead.
Take it.
Just take it.
All right, how about this?
All right?
How about that?
- Come on, Flash.
- Flash, stop playing, man.
- Take it from him!
- Come on, Flash.
Take it.
Yo, Flash, let's go.
- Let's go!
- Do it, Flash.
What you doing?
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker!
Come on!
They won't make us pay...
-...for the backboard.
- I don't care about the backboard.
- Was that true?
- What?
What I heard in there just now.
Did you humiliate that boy?
Yeah, I did.
- But--
- But what?
- This guy deserved it.
- Did he?
- Yeah.
- Is he the kid that hit you?
Is he?
Yeah, yeah, but...
So all this is about getting even.
If so, I guess you must feel pretty good about yourself now, right?
Am I right or wrong?
Yeah, I thought so.
Well, thanks to this little escapade of yours I had to change shifts at work so you have to pick up Aunt May tonight at 9:00.
- Is that understood?
- Yeah.
Okay, good.
She looks familiar.
The girl on your computer.
Yeah.
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.
Okay.
He's a character.
That's my uncle.
He's a pathological liar.
He thought you were someone else.
Oh, man, you don't have me on your computer?
I took a photo of the debate team, and you're in the debate team.
- Right.
- So he must have seen-- I was touching up stuff.
- Touching up stuff?
- Come on.
I was...
I'm not gonna answer that.
- Did you get expelled?
- No, no.
I didn't get expelled. I got community service.
So you want to-
- I don't know...?
Want to what?
I don't know.
Just...
I don't know-
- We could...
We could do something else, or we could--
- If you don't feel like, we could--
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, either one.
- Really?
- Sure.
Okay.
All right, good. Sounds good.
Cool.
Okay.
- I can't right now, I can't right now.
- Yeah, no.
- I'm so busy right now.
- I know, me too.
But maybe...
- Yeah, just, you know...
- Some other...
- Time, all right.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- All right.
We have protein structure, rDNA chromatography, transgenics testing that's X-ray video.
That's the only one on the planet.
We have...
- Human line testing over--
- I remember that.
I've seen that before.
The Ganali device.
Yeah, I remember a picture of that in my dad's office.
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.
It creates a cloud which can be dispersed over a neighbourhood, even a city.
Theoretically, you could cure polio in an afternoon.
That's incredible.
Well, others disagreed.
What if the device were loaded with a toxin?
What if you wanted to opt out?
You can't run away from a cloud after all, so here it lies, gathering dust.
What you see here is a computer model of a lizard.
Many of these wonderful creatures have so brilliantly adapted that they can regenerate entire limbs at will.
You can imagine my envy.
We're trying to harness this capability and transfer it into our host subject:
Freddy the three-legged mouse.
Enter the algorithm now.
Need to take that?
System ready for gene insertion.
Okay.
Check.
See what I'm trying to do?
- Preempt the proteins.

And thank you.
Meet Fred and Wilma our three-legged mice.
Here you go.
HEY. buddy.
I got you.
Okay.
Careful, don't want to stick you by mistake.
Human trials aren't until next week.
There.
Hey.
Hey, I thought you...
Didn't you forget something?
What?
Now, don't answer that, but I'm glad to know it's working.
You owe your aunt an apology bigtime.
Be a man.
Get in there and apologise.
I'm sorry, Aunt May, I...
Honestly, you don't have to apologise to me.
It's your--
- The hell he doesn't.
- Ben.
Look, I'm sorry, I got distracted.
- Oh, he got distracted.
- Yeah.
Your aunt, my wife, had to walk 12 blocks alone in the middle of the night and then wait in a deserted subway station because you got distracted.
Ben, sweetheart, honestly I am completely capable of walking home--
You will not defend this boy!
- I'm not defending--
- You are!
- Listen to me, son.
- Yeah, go ahead.
You're a lot like your father.
You really are, Peter, and that's a good thing but your father lived by a philosophy, a principle, really.
He believed that if you could do good things for other people you had a moral obligation to do those things.
That's what's at stake here.
Not choice.
Responsibility.
That is nice.
That's great.
That's all well and good.
So where is he?
- What?
- Where is he?
Where's my dad?
He didn't think it was his responsibility to be here to tell me himself?
Oh, come on, how dare you?
How dare I?
How dare you?
Where you going?
Peter, come back here, please.
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He'll be all right.
Peter!
Peter?
Peter!
It's $2.07.
It's $2.07.
Yeah.
No, I know.
Yeah, you're holding up the line.
No.
You can leave a penny, you can't take a penny.
- What?
- You can leave a penny anytime, you have to spend 10 dollars to take a penny.
It's store policy.
- You're holding up my line.
- I don't have 2 cents.
You can't afford milk, step aside.
Daddy didn't give you enough milk money today?
We're talking about 2 cents.
Just step aside, kid.
Really?
Yo, not cool, bro.
Hey, man, stop!
Somebody stop that guy!
Hey, kid, little help?
Not my policy.
Somebody stop that dude!
Hey!
Hey, stop!
Somebody stop that dude!
Hey!
Oh, God, oh, God.
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.
Call an ambulance!
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.
Oh, God, oh, my God.
On, God.
No.
Oh, Jesus.
Witnesses gave a description to the sketch artist.
I need you to take a look.
No, I don't know him.
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives are on it.
We'll see what they turn up.
Okay.
Can I have that?
Sure.
There's one other thing.
He has a star... tattooed on his left hand.
Peter, I know things have been difficult lately and I'm sorry about that.
I think I know what you're feeling.
Hey, Parker.
- Not today.
- Come on, I just want to talk.
It feels better, right?
Look, your uncle died.
I'm sorry.
I get it.
I'm sorry.
Okay?
Peter.
Stay away from him.
- You understand?
- Hey!
- Stay away from Joey.
- Hey!
You like beating on girls?
You like beating on old men?
Hey, pal keep walking.
- You're in the wrong place.
- When were you in Queens?
I asked you a question.
Nicky, no!
That the gun?
You gonna kill me too?
Hey!
Stop it!
Hey. get off!
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!
Back up!
This guy is crazy!
Get him!
Get back here, man!
Get him!
Follow him!
- Go around, man!
- I'll follow you!
Go, go, go!
There he is!
Can't get away!
He has a star tattooed on his left hand.
Oh, yeah?
Come on!
I know what you look like!
You hear me?
I've seen your face!
Is that all you got?
Just take it, take it.

Hey.
You got a description?
Well, no, he wears a mask.
A mask?
Most of his victims are suspects with serious rap sheets.
Okay, he's not a vigilante, he's an anarchist.
Help me, somebody!
Arrest me!
Get me out of here.
Hey, look!
Spandex.
Spandex.
Everything spandex.
Extraordinary velocity vector is a function of both mass and acceleration.
Come on, you know better than anyone the weight on any pendulum has no effect on speed.
It doesn't affect frequency, but it's totally a factor in momentum.
Hey, Aunt May.
Yeah.Eggs?
Organic, got it.
In the future, if you're gonna steal cars don't dress like a car thief, man.
What are you?
You a cop?
Really?
You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?
You know, you're...
You've got a mind of the true scholar, sir.
I was going more for the guys who do the luge.
Good thinking.
Get out the window.
There you go. You got it.
Crotch!
- Just let me go.
- Is that a real knife?
Yes, it's a real knife.
My weakness, it's small knives.
- Just let me go.
- Anything but knives!
Oh, it's so simple.
- That was cool.
- What is this?
Webbing I developed. I don't think you want to know.
Let me go!
Okay, one second.
Hold on, one second.
Knock it off, man.
No!
Come on, let me go.
Stop it!
That isn't funny.
- It is kind of funny.
- Help!
This could've gone a lot worse.
Now hold still.
Boys in blue here.
- Yo, I got him.
- Freeze!
- He's not going anywhere.
- Don't move.
You serious?
Who are you?
No one grasps the concept of the mask.
Freeze!
I just did 80 percent of your job.
And that?
That's how you repay me?
Hold it right there!
Well, that was fun.
Bus!
Hey there, everybody.
What are you doing?
Hey, watch out.
I'm swinging here.
I'm swinging here.
So 38 of New York's finest versus one guy in a unitard.
Am I correct?
You don't have to wait up for me.
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
- Okay.
- Where were you?
I was out.
Did you get the eggs?
Nope.
Forgot the eggs.
I'm gonna get them now.
No, you most certainly will not.
Not at this hour.
Look at me, Peter.
Take off the damn hood and look at me.
Peter.
Where do you go?
Who does this to you?
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.
- Please tell me.
- Aunt May, please please, please go to sleep.
I can't sleep.
Don't you understand?
I can't sleep.
Peter, listen to me.
Secrets have a cost.
They're not for free.
Not now, not ever.
Cross-species genetics is finally working.
I've used the lizard DNA to help Freddy regrow that limb.
It's a miracle.
No, it's hard work and promise.
- It's a step closer to the primate lab.
- He doesn't have time for every little step.
Little?
I just mean he can't wait.
Well, he'll have to.
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.
That's not what I'm saying-
So, what are you saying?
You have to start human trials.
Now.
No, I don't, and no, I won't.
- Well, then he's going to die.
- People die.
Even Norman Osborn.
We are not finished.
Human trials?
Where are you going to find the people to volunteer?
As far as anyone's concerned, it's for a flu shot.
I might think the Veterans Hospital is a place to start.
I don't think I am.
It's a little late for shock and indignation.
About 15 years late.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Richard Parker wore it well.
On you, it's a cheap suit, as it was then.
I had nothing to do with that.
Is that what you told his son?
I don't know what you're saying.
You don't know, or you don't wanna know?
I'll remind you what happened.
Richard Parker said just about the same thing then that you are saying now.
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.
I----
I won't.
Fine.
The formula is ours now anyway.
Say goodbye to that arm you have dreamed of.
I'm shutting you down.
Have your office cleared out by the morning.
Your toys can be taken away too, you know.
Right, Freddy?
- Hey.
- Hi.
How's it going?
Where you headed?
- Monday, B track.
- Oh, it's Thursday.
- It's Thursday?
- What happened?
- What?
- Your eye, it looks bruised.
Oh, yeah, no, I don't...
Maybe I got a rash or...
It's bad. Have you gone to the nurse?
Do you like branzino?
Like, a fish.
No, no.
I know.
I know.
Well, if you want you can come to this address at 8:00 tonight.
My mom's making branzino.
So... It's apartment 2016.
I didn't write that part down.
I don't know why I...
- I'll remember it.
- Oh, okay.
2016.
Hi.
How did you get out there?
The fire escape.
Your doorman's intimidating.
It's 20 storeys.
Yeah. It's all right.
- This is your room.
- Yes, this is my room.
Books.
Shoes.
Oh, hey...
I got your mom these.
Oh, lovely.
- Beautiful, right?
- Beautiful.
They were nice.
- No, they're beautiful.
- I'm sorry.
No, it's impressive. They actually held together very well.
I'm gonna keep these.
You have your suit in there?
My Suit?
It's for dinner.
Are you gonna--?
Are you gonna wear that?
- That's--
- Hey, hon.
You must be Peter.
Dad, this is Peter.
Nice to meet you, sir.
Nice to meet you.
Dinner's ready.
Hope you like branzino.
Who doesn't?
Emma, it's Curt.
- Is he there?
- I'm afraid not, doctor.
The car is taking him to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.
No.
He can't, Emma.
You have to stop him.
He--
I would, but I always lose him on the bridge.
I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns your call as soon as possible.
I'm going to Holton Avenue, across the river.
You want me to take the tunnel or the bridge?
Bridge!
Take the bridge.
All right, we'll do that.
Hey, you all right back there?
You tweaking man?
Just drive.
Okay.
You're having trouble there?
The head goes on the other--
Help Gwen's friend with his fish.
On, I... I got no idea.
First time.
- Branzino.
- George.
- Tell us about your day.
- Did you catch that spider guy yet?
No, we didn't catch him yet.
But we will.
He's an amateur who's assaulting civilians in the dead of night.
He's clumsy, he leaves clues but he's still dangerous.
He's assaulting people?
I'm not sure.
I mean, I saw that video with him and the car thief, and...
I think most people would say that he was providing a public service.
Most people would be wrong.
If I wanted the car thief off the street, he'd already be off the street.
So why wasn't he then?
Let me illuminate you.
The car thief was leading us to the people who run the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.
It's called strategy. I'm sure you're aware of the term?
- You've heard about that in school?
- Yeah.
Good.
I know.
- He didn't know you had a plan.
- You seem to know a lot about this.
Know something we don't?
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm not on anyone's side.
I saw a video on the internet--
You saw the video on the Internet.
- Well, then the case is closed.
- Well, no.
If you watch the video--
Maybe send you a link?
It looks like he's trying to help.
On the Internet he's being made out to look like a hero.
No, no.
I'm not saying he's a hero.
- What are you trying to say?
- He's trying to help.
He's trying to do something the police can't.
Something the police can't?
- I don't know.
- What do you think we do?
Sit around eating doughnuts with our thumbs planted up our asses?
- George.
George.
- Daddy.
- Up your what?
- Howard.
He stands for what you stand for.
Protecting innocent people from bad guys.
I stand for law and order.
That's what I stand for.
Okay?
I wear a badge.
This guy wears a mask like an outlaw.
He's hunting down criminals that all look the same like he's got some sort of personal vendetta.
But he's not protecting innocent people, Mr. Parker.
Let's get some air, Peter.
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Yes, we do.
Thank you for having me.
I'm sorry if I insulted you.
It was not my intention.
- You're welcome.
- Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Dad.
- Yeah?
Well, that was something.
I'm sorry.
I thought he was going to arrest me at one point.
No, I wouldn't have let him arrest you.
- What happened to your face?
- I wanna tell you something.
Okay.
I've been bitten...
So have I.
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.
I gotta tell you this thing about...
-...the vigilante and the car thief.
- Oh, okay.
What?
- No, no, no.
- I don't want to talk about that.
Forget that.
I won't talk about that.
- I'm gonna talk about me, okay?
- What about you?
It's impo-
- I wish I could just--
I can't.
It's hard to say.
Just say it.
- I don't know.
- Say it.
What?
What?
What?
Okay, then forget it.
You...?
- You're Spider-Man.
- Shut up.
Gwen?
Gwen...
Your father wants you to come inside.
Okay.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Gwen.
I'm coming.
Oh, I'm in trouble.
Will you please find out what is going on, Alfred?
Excellent.
Hey!
Hey!
What is that?
- Oh, my God!
- I don't know!
Get back in the car!
Help!
Help!
Incoming!
Somebody help!
Help me!
My kid is trapped!
I want my dad!
Dad!
- Hey,hey,hey
- Help!
Hey, buddy.
- It's okay.
- Get away.
- Help!
- Hey, look.
Just a normal guy, all right?
Wanna hold this?
Hold my mask.
All right.
What's your name?
Jack?
- Yes.
- Let's get you out of here.
Okay, stay very still.
All right.
Okay, I got you.
Okay, look.
I'll undo the belt.
You hold on to that seat in front of you.
On three?
- All right.
- Okay, one, two, three.
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.
All right, okay.
Jack, climb now.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
Put it on, the mask.
It's gonna make you strong.
Jack, trust me.
Put it on.
There you go. That's it. That's it, buddy.
Okay, now, climb.
Come on, Jack.
Do me a favour.
A little faster, okay, bud?
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.
That's it.
Keep coming.
Keep it coming.
Keep coming.
No!
Jack.
Oh, God.
Thank God.
You okay?
My son.
My son.
Oh, my son.
My son.
Who are you?
Spider-Man.
Beautiful.
Settle down, guys.
Settle down, boys.
Settle down.
- Come on. - Listen.
At approximately 9 p.m. last night, an incident took place on the Williamsburg Bridge.
Much of what occurred is speculation at this point.
However, several eyewitnesses to the crime, as well as our own preliminary findings, have positively placed one individual at the scene.
Which is why, this morning I am issuing a warrant for the masked vigilante known as Spider-Man.
And lastly, city council members met with homeowners and airport officials in the first of four meetings...
It's so beautiful.
Knows how to bite though.
Who else knows about this?
Just you.
Really?
Hey, you don't...
You don't believe what the police are saying, do you?
Of course not.
Does it scare you?
What you can do?
No.
No.
What did that thing on the bridge look like?
It was real big. Too big to be human.
You gotta lay low.
No, can't do that.
You've got to.
I mean, why...?
Because of last night.
Those people on the bridge.
Whatever was attacking them would have killed them.
So I gotta go after it.
That's not your job.
Maybe it is.
I really liked kissing you.
You're an amazing kisser.
Well, you know, it was--
It was good for me too.
Yeah?
Who did that?
Hello!
It's not nice to snoop.
I gave everyone the week off.
Yeah.
Shouldn't you be at school?
No, I got a free track.
I wanted to ask you a question.
How would a predator track a reptile?
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top of their food chain.
Kings of their domain.
They gotta have vulnerabilities.
Why the sudden interest in the cold-blooded?
Just asking a question.
I got school stuff.
Biology profiles to do.
So because of the cold blood would they react to changes in temperatures?
You'd have to catch one first.
Did you know there's a rumor of a new species in New York?
Beautiful and quite large.
What do you know about it?
You seen it?
No, it's not yet classified.
But it can be aggressive if threatened.
Doc, you all right?
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Afraid I have to ask you to leave. I have a new project I'm working on.
I need to be alone.
Good.
Good, good.
Good.
Don't worry, Mr. Parker. I'll be back.
Wonderful things are coming.
Wonderful things.
Fred?
Mr. Mayor, if there was a giant dinosaur running around you would be the first to know.
So tell your son he can rest easy, all right?
Yeah.
You and me both, sir.
Okay.
Bye-bye-
Mr. Parker, why are you...
-...not in school?
- Got a free track.
Okay, well, I do not.
So make your point quickly.
Fine, there may not be a dinosaur running around.
There is something more dangerous, and I know who.
- You know who?
- Dr. Curtis Connors.
- He's a biochemist.
- Of Oscorp?
- That's right.
- Dr. Connors who's my daughter's mentor.
Is that who?
- That's the one.
- Okay.
Recently, Dr. Connors gave Gwen a college recommendation.
It was beautiful. When I read it, I cried.
You would have me believe that he is running around dressed up like a dinosaur?
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur. He has transformed himself into a lizard.
Let me ask you a question.
Do I look like the mayor of Tokyo to you?
I'm telling you the absolute truth.
This man has worked for his whole life on cross-species genetics.
He lost an arm, he tried to grow it back, but the equation was imbalanced.
He has turned into a lizard. He's using lizard DNA.
He is dangerous, and he is planning something horrific. I know. I know.
Okay.
All right, I get it.
Here's what we'll do.
You'll go back to hanging out with the citizens of Tokyo.
I'm gonna go back to protecting the citizens of this fine, fair city of ours.
Sergeant Butler, please escort Mr. Parker...
-...back to school.
- Captain Stacy, I'm not messing around.
Just bring him in.
Just call him in. You have to call him in.
He is a danger to everybody.
- Just, please, listen to me.
- Let's go.
Jimmy.
Get me everything we have on Dr. Curtis Connors.
- Okay?
Right away.
- Yeah.
Dr. Curtis Connors.
Current temperature: 89.7.
Steady for 48 hours.
Blood panels reveal lymphocyte and monocyte readings consistent with subject's past.
Clotting rate vastly improved.
Marked enhancement in muscle response strength and elasticity.
Eyesight similarly improved.
Subject no longer requires corrective lenses.
This is no longer about curing ills.
This is about finding perfection.
In attempt to redress regenerative relapse dosage has been increased to 200 milligrams.
You stopped me once.
You won't stop me again.
I'm getting stronger every day!
Oh, that sucked.
Peter Parker.
Come in.
You should maybe consider coming in through the lobby.
Also, my father is under the impression...
-...that you require psychiatric attention.
- Oh, really?
Peter.
What happened?
You should see the other guy.
The other guy, in this instance, being a giant mutant lizard.
Hey, Gwen, honey.
Do you want cocoa?
Howard's making some.
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.
Honestly, I'm 17 years old.
Okay.
I remembered somebody saying her fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.
Well, that's impractical.
And fattening.
Chocolate house.
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's good.
I can't have cocoa right now because I'm work--
I'm doing this...
I have cramps.
I feel kind of pukey and just sort of...
- Like, emotional.
I keep crying. - It's okay. Good.
- Good.
- It's brutal.
You don't want to know.
- It's, like, bad.
- Got it.
- Thanks, Daddy.
- All right.
Easy, Bug BOY
What'd you call me?
I'm going to be all right.
- No.
No.
- Yes.
Yes.
I know what this is.
What is it?
Every day, for as long as I can remember, my father has left every morning and he's put a badge on his chest and strapped a gun to his hip.
And every day, for as long as I can remember I haven't known if he was gonna make it home.
I got you.
Okay?
Okay?
I gotta stop him, though.
I have to, because I created him.
What do you mean?
I gave him an equation that made all of this possible.
Something my father had been working on, you know.
Secretly. Now I realise why he kept it a secret.
Point is, this is my responsibility.
I have to fix it.
Peter.
Hey.
Let's get out of here.
Let's just get out of here.
Just for a minute.
Can we?
- No.
No.
- Yeah.
Yes.
- Yes.
- No.
Yes.
If my parents see me leaving, I'm dead.
Your parents aren't gonna see you leaving.
Peter Parker.
Spider-Man.
I'm not the one who needs help.
There will be no more loneliness no more outcasts.
Species-wide distribution could enhance humanity on an evolutionary scale.
One has to adapt to survive.
"That, changing like the snake, I might be free to cast off flesh wherein I dwell confined."
Would you give it all up after all you know you can do?
All the power you feel.
I can save... them!
You won't get in the way of my plan Peter Parker!
Go.
Go!
Nowhere to hide, Peter.
All these souls lost and alone.
I can save them.
I can cure them.
There's no need to stop me Peter.
You're not thinking straight, doc.
Stop this.
This isn't you.
Let's talk this out.
Doc!
Oh, boy.
You don't want to talk?
There you go.
Don't make me have to hurt you!
That is disgusting.
Gwen.
- I'm gonna throw you out the window.
- What?
Somebody's been a bad lizard.
- Hey.
- Where are you?
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
I'm in the sewer, tracking him.
I gotta stop him before anyone gets hurt.
But we need an antidote.
- Do you know how to run a serum?
- I do it all the time.
Okay, great.
Okay, I need you to go to Oscorp.
I need you to access the cross-species file.
It's a blue serum
File 12389.
Okay, got it.
On my WHY
I spent my life as a scientist trying to create a world without weakness without outcasts.
I sought to create a stronger human being but there's no such thing.
Human beings are weak, pathetic, feeble-minded creatures.
Why be human at all when we can be so much more?
Faster. Stronger.
Smarter.
This is my gift to you.
Oscorp.
- Captain Stacy!
- What?
We have a confirmed sighting, sir. The Lizard's headed...
-...toward Canal Street.
- What about Spider-Man?
Inside the high school.
I want that Spider-Man off the street.
The lizard creature has released a biological agent.
All efforts to stop him have failed and he is now proceeding north on 7th Avenue.
- Hi.
- Where are you?
Peter, hi.
I'm at Oscorp.
You have to get out of there now.
- The antidote is cooking.
- No, no, no.
Connors is on the way.
He's coming to you right now.
He needs the device. He's gonna infect the whole city!
Eight minutes left.
You're gonna wait eight minutes after what I told you?
You leave right now.
That is an order, okay?
I'll get everybody out.
Did you hear wh--?
Gwen!
Gwen!
You Mother Hubbard.
Are you serious?
He's heading south.
Stand down now, or we will open fire.
You are surrounded.
Go, go!
Clear, sir!
All clear here, sir!
Freeze!
Down on the ground.
Your hands behind your head.
Now!
Parker.
It's headed to Oscorp!
And your daughter's there right now.
You gotta let me go.
Hold your fire!
Well, Paul, if I didn't see it, I wouldn't believe it.
I won't venture to say what it is crawling up the north side of the Oscorp Tower but clearly it is not human and it is very, very strong.
Time remaining: one minute.
Antidote complete.
Oh, man.
We're getting the latest details. This is just coming in.
The New York Police Department has called for a city-wide evacuation everything south of 54th Street.
If you are south of 54th Street you have to move out of the area immediately.
Spider-Man appears to be heading towards Oscorp.
He looks injured and it's really not clear if he's gonna make it.
That's the guy who saved my boy on the bridge.
Troy, they're clearing us out.
Something bad's going down in Midtown.
Still friends with Matthews, that crane operator on 6th?
- Yeah.
- Get him on the phone for me.
The cops are evacuating everybody.
Get him on the phone for me.
Hey, Charlie, get me Enrique: on 54th Street!
- You got it.
- Angelo, get your mug over here.
Wolski!
You're getting some overtime!
All tower cranes on 6th... swing your jib arms over the avenue Boom angles at 90 degrees.
Spider-Man needs those big boys high and lined up.
Let's give him a clear approach. Over.
Come on, Parker.
Hey.
Dad!
- I have to get this to Spider-Man.
- Get in.
- It can stop the Lizard.
- Get in the car.
- You don't understand!
- Yes, I do.
Your boyfriend is a man of many masks.
I get it.
Give me this.
Get in the car.
Please make sure he's okay.
Initializing Ganali device.

He's not alone.

The Lizard.
It's okay.
We stopped him.
Okay.
Let's get you out of here.
Come on.
Okay, okay, okay.
Look at me.
Stay with me.
- Help's on the way, okay?
- You need to...
You need to be gone when they get here.
Okay?
I'm not going anywhere.
I was wrong about you, Peter.
This city needs you.
Here.
You're gonna need this.
You're gonna make enemies.
People will get hurt.
Sometimes the people closest to you.
So I want you to promise me something, okay?
Leave Gwen out of it.
Promise me that.
You promise me.
An eerie calm has set in over New York City.
Apparently, some sort of aerosolised antidote was launched from Oscorp Tower, which seems to have counteracted the biotoxins.
Residents of Lower Manhattan can rest peacefully knowing that the alleged mastermind of this terror plot, Dr. Curtis Connors, is behind bars.
Sweetheart, it's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Rough night.
It's gonna be all right.
Where have you been?
Hi.
My father died.
There was a funeral.
They shot off rifles and they made speeches.
Two of my teachers showed up.
And Flash showed up.
Everyone was there but you.
Can't do this.
Can't do this.
I'm sorry.
I can't...
What are you saying?
I can't see you anymore.
I can't.
He made you promise, didn't he?
To stay away from me, so I'd be safe.
What a pretty girl.
Yeah.
That's what Uncle Ben said.
Did you ask her out?
Why?
Can't.
Why?
I'm just no good for her.
Peter Parker, if there's one thing you are, it's good.
Anyone has a problem with that can talk to me.
Peter, I know things have been difficult lately and I'm sorry about that.
I think I know what you're feeling.
Ever since you were a little boy you've been living with so many unresolved things.
Well, take it from an old man:
Those things send us down a road.
They make us who we are.
And if anyone's destined for greatness, it's you, son.
You owe the world your gifts.
You just have to figure out how to use them.
And know that wherever they take you we'll always be here.
So come on home, Peter.
You're my hero.
And I love you.
- What's up, Parker?
- What's up?
Hey. How's it going?
You coming along, man?
Cool shirt.
Yeah.
Dude's crazy.
But chicks dig him.
I had a professor once who liked to tell his students that there were only 10 different plots in all of fiction.
Well, I'm here to tell you he was wrong.
There is only one:
"Who am I"?
Mr. Parker.
Tardy again.
At least we can always count on you.
Sorry, Miss Ritter, won't happen again, I promise.
Don't make promises you can't keep.
Yeah, but those are the best kind.
Okay, class, open your books.
Let's begin on page one.
Hello, doctor.
Did you tell the boy?
Tell him what?
Did you tell the boy the truth about his father?
No.
Well, that's very good.
So we'll let him be for now.
Take them into the forest now.
You stay here.
I'll be back soon.
- Wait!
- No!
I said, stay here!
Father!
Wait!
Help us!
Please!
Hello!
Is anybody there?
Eat!
- Eat!
Eat!
Eat!
This oven's not hot enough!
More wood!
What?
Is it hot enough for you now, bitch?
My sister and I never saw our parents again.
It was just the two of us.
But we learned a couple of things while trapped in that house.
One:
Never walk into a house made of candy.
And two:
If you're gonna kill a witch, set her ass on fire.
Fresh milk!
Fresh milk for the children!
Keep your children healthy!
Fresh milk!
After weeks of living in fear, we have finally caught the one responsible for all this terror!
For crimes against the city and people of Augsburg, and for consorting with the spawn of Satan,
I hereby accuse this woman of the craft of witchery!
Burn her!
Burn her!
Behold the eyes of the demon.
Go to hell.
Order!
Order!
Berringer, this is still my town.
Listen to me.
As your mayor, I know only too well that many of you have lost precious loved ones to this witch plague, but we can't just burn this woman.
We first need evidence.
We can't just have...
You know a witch when you see one!
They ride at night and they make pacts with the devil!
This woman will burn!
Burn her!
Burn her!
Let the girl go or I'm gonna blow your sheriff's brains all over these fucking hillbillies.
Move.
Go on.
Let her go.
Go over there.
Check her.
What's your name?
What's your name?
- Mina.
- Don't worry.
When a woman truly deals in witchcraft, she cannot hide it.
A nasty rot sets in. It shows in her teeth, in her skin and her eyes.
This is not a witch.
This woman's clean.
I'm sure your sheriff was only trying to protect you good people.
But your mayor has done a very smart thing.
He hired us.
My name is Gretel, and this is my brother, Hansel.
We know that many of your children have gone missing.
But killing an innocent woman will not bring them back.
Go home!
We don't want you here!
We don't want more evil in Augsburg!
Well, evil is upon you, whether you like it or not.
Now if your children are still alive, we will find them.
But if anyone harms this woman, you're gonna have me to deal with.
Now go home!
Go!
I guess you're free to go.
Thank you,
Hansel.
You're welcome.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Huh?
That woman is a suspect in my custody.
You can't just come here...
Any man with half a brain could see that she was not a witch.
Now listen, Sheriff.
Hansel and Gretel have been brought here...
You better listen!
I'm not going to have this bitch and her scoundrel of a brother coming into my town, telling me what to do.
Don't!
Just don't.
Come on.
Let's get you started.
There's been reports of a strange cottage in the north forest.
Locals won't go near the place.
A good place to start the investigation.
Move!
Gretel!
She looks angry.
Yeah.
A face like that, I'd be angry, too.
- Would you shut up?
That witch we found was a dead end, Mayor.
No trace of any kids.
I'm sorry.
But we found this.
That is called the Blood Moon, Mayor.
An eclipse of the moon.
It happens once in a generation and is a night most holy to witches.
Oh, my God.
When?
According to this, three nights from now.
There's no doubt in my mind that all this is connected.
Children being taken in these numbers from the roads and fields so close to town.
A witch does not come out in the open like that.
Not unless she has to.
Witch activity has been increasing lately.
More sightings, animal slaughter, Sabbaths.
It seems the coming of the Blood Moon is dragging every damned witch from their dark hiding place.
So, it seems like a good thing that you brought us here, doesn't it, Mayor?
Half your money now.
The rest when the children are brought back alive.
Oh, there he is, right on time.
This is Jackson.
He knows these woods inside and out.
And he'll take you to where the last sightings were.
Yeah.
We can be there in a few hours.
Not at night.
It's too dangerous.
We'll leave in the morning.
Yeah, she's right.
It's much too dangerous.
So, any place we can get a drink in this hellhole?
Shut up!
The last one they took was a boy.
Less than two days ago, so the scent is still fresh.
100 shilling for every child you return alive.
You better be fast before our mayor's witch hunters rob this town blind.
You leave tonight.
In witch country at night?
You must be out of your mind.
Not until you finish the job.
Thank you, Wolfgang.
I'm telling you, we should put the fire out.
We're hunting witches, not bears.
And we have to eat.
Such beautiful creatures.
Are they yours?
Yes, ma'am.
Why have you come here?
To the dark of the forest?
A child was taken, ma'am.
We're here to find him and take him back.
There are no children here.
Here...
There's only death!
- Witch!
Fools!
This is my land!
How dare you?
Please?
Please, God...
No.
There's no use in praying, my friend.
Even your God knows better than to come here.
So we got this witch on the ground, right?
And her eyes, they start rolling back in her head.
They're glowing red.
She's trying to put a Soul Searcher spell on me, you see.
So I slap her and rip out her tongue.
And she starts pissing, starts pissing everywhere, right?
But a witch's piss, it's the worst, you see, because it actually burns the ground.
It's like acid.
Although, in small doses, it does cure poison ivy, insect bites.
I'm getting way off the subject, aren't I?
I've got to get back to my friends.
What are you looking at?
There have been abductions here and here, on both sides of the river.
And on this last one, we believe a troll was involved.
- A troll?
- Trolls are extra.
Hey, so what's wrong with the girls in this place, huh?
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't bar wenches supposed to be easy?
- It's really unusual.
- Yes, it is unusual.
Look at this one.
A father and three children attacked.
One child was taken, but she didn't touch the other two.
- That's weird.
That's so weird.
- It is strange.
It is strange, okay!
- Yeah, yeah.
Then again, we hunt witches for a living.
What's normal, really?
Excuse me.
Hansel and Gretel?
Oh, my God, I can't believe you're here.
I'm Ben.
Benjamin Walser.
I am really quite a fan of your work.
That's great.
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.
Listen, if it's not too much trouble,
- would you please sign...
- Oh, no...
Okay.
- Oh, my.
Yeah, that's from when you found the Fox Witch of Antwerp
- and sank her in the moat. - Oh!
And this one's from the Secret Witch Ring of Belsen.
When they tried to put a gate to hell under the courthouse.
I mean, you guys, you certainly taught those witches a thing or two.
Wow.
- This is amazing.
- And, uh, weird.
- A little creepy.
- Yeah...
You really keep all this stuff.
All right, well...
I just have so many questions.
Do you mind?
- You know, we have...
- Oh, no, no.
- You go ahead.
- All right, um...
Okay.
Um, how do you best kill a witch?
Hansel?
Uh, cutting off their heads tends to work.
Ripping out their hearts.
And skinning them is also nice.
Yeah, but burning is the best way.
'Cause that's the only way to be safe.
- Burning, yeah, of course.
- Burn them all.
Oh, is it true that witches can't harm you?
Well, no, that is horseshit, son.
Their magic doesn't work on us.
And they haven't killed us, yet.
Oh, do you think that's because of the witch that you burned when you were children?
I guess that's how it all started for you guys.
I mean, is that how you became witch hunters?
How did you get your guns?
- How did you get your weapons?
- Okay, okay.
There's lots of things to do.
You're a really nice kid, but we have a town under attack.
She killed them!
She killed them all.
Who killed what?
The witch!
She killed the trackers.
All of them.
She gave me a message.
For you all.
The Curse of Hunger for Crawling Things.
I fucking hate that one.
That was awesome.
The witch hunters are near, I can smell their stench.
Your plan's working.
Did you bring the preparations?
Of course, Muriel.
Oiled frogs, fattened on possum maggots.
And Carpathian nightshade, deadly to the touch, most rare.
And, Muriel, we brought something to test it with.
Open your mouth.
Open!
Swallow, little pig!
He's ready.
It's working.
It's not even warm.
Muriel, this could change everything.
It will change everything.
We will be invincible.
Ow, Ow! Take it out.
Take it out!
Take it out!
It's of no use if it doesn't last.
I can make it last.
Forever.
Where are we going?
We're almost there.
Hey.
Hey.
I just had this really weird dream.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
About what?
I think it was about our mother.
We don't talk about that.
Go to sleep.
What do you think?
Boy, girl?
Okay.
Here you go.
I'll take this.
A little small for you, maybe.
Oh, hello.
Uh, no, this, this is...
This is not for me.
Um, so, how goes the witch hunting?
It's good.
Witch hunting's good.
It's strange being among these people.
Yeah?
If you hadn't come, they'd have burned me alive.
Yeah, well, I probably would have let them, but I'm old-fashioned that way.
My sister, however, requires a little bit more evidence before someone gets roasted.
- Have you ever come across a witch that you didn't want to kill?
No, never.
The only good witch is a dead witch.
- Can you hold this? - Mmm-hmm.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
When I was a kid, a witch made me eat so much candy, I got sick.
Something happened to me.
I have to take this injection every few hours or else I die.
You have the sugar sickness.
I actually know a thing or two about it if you ever need any help...
It's all right.
- So...
- I'm fine.
It was good seeing you.
Yeah.
You're very handsome.
And no man in this town will walk with me.
And you have my pumpkin.
I...
I have to go.
- See you. - Mmm-hmm.
It'll all be perfect.
Daddy!
Daddy, please help me!
I'm lost!
Daddy, please!
Please help me!
I'm lost!
Daddy, I'm scared!
I'm alone in the woods!
I can help you, little boy.
Sweet little boy.
- Please help me!
Daddy!
I'm scared!
I'm alone in the woods!
Please help...
You move, you die.
Get her wand.
Will you stop that?
I like your toys.
They have brought a live witch into my office!
They need to interrogate her.
That's all there is to it.
Now...
Good night, Sheriff.
Hey, wake up.
What is she doing?
I have no idea.
I see them.
Is she there?
That Gretel bitch?
Oh, yes, under the moon, over the sheriff,
in the town.
There she is.
Good morning, sunshine.
You tell us what we want and this might not end up being the most painful night of your life.
Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
No, no, better, fuck each other.
These witches, they never learn.
Let's try this again.
Where are the children?
Why so many?
Where are the children?
The blood of the twelve moons will soon be collected.
And after that, only one object remains.
Why don't you just burn her?
We're wasting our time.
She's useless.
Twelve moons.
Twelve...
Twelve, twelve...
How many children have been taken so far?
I don't know, ten or eleven.
The files.
We need to count them.
- It's eleven.
- Eleven.
Twelve moons.
They need one more child.
One more child.
Look, there's gotta be some sort of pattern.
- Look for their age...
- Yeah.
...hair color, genders, something.
- I've got five girls.
- Six boys.
You need another girl?
"Twelve moons," what does that mean?
It's a month.
It's a month.
There's no April.
April is missing.
It's April.
They need a girl born in April.
You are too late.
- Go!
- Yes!
Sheriff, birth records of Augsburg.
Do you have them here?
It is there.
Strictly for the law of this town, not for filthy bounty hunters like yourself.
Come on.
There can't be that many.
- Anything?
- I only got one!
Little girl, six years old, born April 8th.
- She's the only one I could find.
- You go.
This girl, do you know her?
Yes, I know her.
Mary Behlmer.
Where does she live?
Sheriff, she's in danger!
Fire!
Fire!
Time is up.
Tell me where she lives.
Over here!
- Mama! - Shh!
Stop!
Stop right there!
Oh, no!
No, no.
Oh, no.
No, Lucas!
Lucas.
No!
Damn you!
Too late, already damned.
Take her back!
To the Well!
Over here!
We need more help!
Now whatever happens, I want you to stay cool.
- Follow my lead.
Okay?
- Got it.
Are you a good shot?
No.
Not really.
That's why I use a shotgun.
Gretel, the famous witch hunter.
Finally we meet.
Who are you?
I see you got my invitation.
Say your name or I'll pin you to the fucking wall.
I go by many names, none of which you're worthy of pronouncing.
Oh, my God.
Help!
Help!
Please!
Hey!
Fuck you!
Help!
Feisty bitch.
Shit.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to kill you.
Not now.
And not like this.
You have something I need.
The last ingredient.
Ugh! Humans have such ghastly taste.
I think this place could use a bit
of color.
Shit!
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
Yes.
No, people.
Please be calm.
Yeah, one at a time.
Look what his witch hunters have brought to Augsburg.
Seven people burnt to death in the fire.
And another young, innocent child taken because of those witch hunters.
No.
Because of you.
I say bring them all to justice.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
No!
No!
The witch hunters are not the ones to blame for this.
This is madness.
People, hasn't enough blood been shed?
No, no...
Not enough, Mayor.
Not yet.
- Good morning.
- What are you doing?
You were covered in filth, so I was just cleaning.
What happened?
Well, the witches took a young girl, and a lot of people died in the fires.
And now the Sheriff, he's blaming you and your brother for what happened last night.
Augsburg's not really safe for you anymore.
And my brother?
Last time I saw him, he was fighting one of them on her broom, flying out of town.
Right.
Wow.
Where did you get all this stuff?
From everywhere.
I actually plan to be a witch hunter, too, when I get older.
Like you guys.
This isn't the life we chose, Ben.
I was wondering about that story about your parents leaving you.
Is all that true?
Yep.
Why?
I don't know.
That's what they did.
Um, I'm sorry.
Do you want some porridge?
Ah! Sure.
Not too hot, not too cold, but just right.
So last night, who was she, the witch who attacked us?
I don't know.
She looked normal at first, but then she changed her face.
- I thought only Grand...
- Grand Witches have that ability, yeah.
Who is this?
She lived outside of town a long time ago.
She was accused of witchcraft, but she never confessed.
We just burned her anyway.
You're safe.
You'll be safe.
I have to find my brother.
Hansel!
Hey!
Hansel!
Are you all right?
Oh, shit.
The witch hunting is going well, I see.
Yeah.
Hey, say, can you...
Can you tell me which way is back to town?
That way.
That way.
Okay.
Thank you!
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- You need some help?
- No, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Thank you.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Motherfucker!
Are you okay?
Hi.
Help me.
Hansel!
Hansel!
Hansel!
Come here.
Oh, she's a wild one, eh?
What do you think you're doing?
You're under arrest for the burning of Augsburg and for bringing the witch plague to our streets.
Listen, you idiot!
The witches are planning something big!
I need to find my brother and save your shitty little...
Shut up.
This time,
I do the talking.
You do the bleeding.
Are you done yet?
I've got to get to my sister.
This may take a while.
But if we don't clean it, you'll get the fever.
Fever?
You've really taken a beating, haven't you?
I think the real damage was to my dignity, which I left somewhere in that tree back there.
It's probably gonna be easier if you just get in.
Oh, no, no.
No, I can't.
The water is healing.
Yeah, I don't swim well.
Then I'll go in with you.
Oh, okay.
Oh, boy.
So, it's healing waters, did you say?
I have a passion.
Horses, just love them.
Beautiful creatures, huh?
When you break any kind of a horse, you have to be hard on them from the beginning.
Show them who's boss.
Or else, they will never learn.
At first, they will hate you.
But once their spirit is broken, they will do anything you want.
Bitch!
Hey, boss, maybe we should take her back to town now.
I'm not finished breaking her yet!
You're making this too easy.
I got it.
You know, the last time I was in waters like this,
I came across a formidable Serpent Witch.
She mostly looked like a toad but she could breathe underwater, which made her difficult to track.
- She was deadly. - Shh.
You talk too much.
You're pathetic.
She has guts.
I like that.
That's going to make me enjoy this even more.
No!
Well, boys, you can have her, after I'm done...
No!
No!
...If there's anything left.
What the hell?
No!
Following this road, you should be able to make it back to Augsburg by nightfall.
Yeah.
I hope so.
When you find your sister, could you come back to see me again?
Yes, of course.
Drink.
No.
Drink!
Why did you save me?
Trolls serve witches.
Hey, wait.
Wait!
What's your name?
Edward.
Edward, wait!
Where am I?
Hansel?
Gretel?
Where have you been? - Where have you been?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hey, what happened to your face?
Gretel?
- Who did this to you?
- I'm okay.
Who did this to you?
I'm okay.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- You okay? - Mmm-hmm.
I'm okay.
Where are we?
I don't know.
You okay?
Did you have to land on me?
What is this place?
This isn't a regular witch's lair.
No.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Hey, sis?
I think you're gonna want to come see this.
I think this is our old house.
And this is our old room.
Here.
Look.
There's your bed.
Right?
Remember this?
I think that's you.
And some sort of vicious badger.
Old beds.
Hansel.
You ever wonder what happened to our parents?
We don't talk about that, Gretel.
We made a promise, you know that.
Why do you think the witches' spells don't work on us?
Leave it alone.
- This is our house.
- Yeah?
This is where we grew up!
And what does that look like to you?
I don't know, Gretel.
We grew up over a witch's lair.
So what?
So we're cursed?
No. I think that our mother was...
I see you finally found your way home after all these years.
Mmm. How very sweet.
I remember this house.
The house of Adrianna, the Great White Witch.
Your whore of a mother.
Let me tell you a little story.
Once upon a time, near a shitty little town, there was a farmer who fell in love with a white witch.
And with their two beautiful children, oh, they were so happy.
But not for long.
During a Blood Moon, there is a potion that will make you immune to fire.
The key to the potion is the heart of a Grand White Witch.
But your mother, the most powerful white witch, was too strong for us.
So it had to be you, Gretel.
It had to be your heart.
As the Blood Moon approached, I sent out a little rumor to the people of Augsburg.
And when she knew they were coming, she had your father take you into the forest to hide you.
- Father!
Don't let her get away!
She didn't know what they would do to her, but she was too proud to run.
And a white witch would never use her magic against humans.
When your father came back for her...
No!
...they hanged him.
- Run him up!
- No!
...right in front of your mother's burning flesh!
Adrianna was gone.
But so was your heart.
And the Blood Moon passed.
The end.
It's a beautiful story, don't you think?
They died to save you.
And all your life, how you've hated them.
Tomorrow sisters from all dark corners of the land will join me in the light of the Blood Moon for the greatest Sabbath of all.
The only thing left is the everlasting power of the heart of a Grand White Witch.
You know, you talk too much.
Bad move, witch hunter.
Hansel!
Drink it.
It will help the pain.
Mina?
What did you do?
Mina?
You're a witch?
There are good witches in the world.
- Not many, but some.
- You stay back.
I'm a witch, but I won't hurt you.
I checked you.
You were...
You were clean.
Yeah, but only the dark witches bear the signs.
Dark witches?
What are you talking about?
Think about it, if their spells don't work on you, why would mine?
I'm not like them, Hansel.
Gretel.
Shit.
- Where are you going?
- They have my sister.
Who has your sister?
Witches have my sister.
They...
- They said something about a ritual or a gathering.
I don't know.
There's a place deep in the forest, nearby the mountains.
A place dark witches use for their Sabbath.
Where is it?
Hansel, I...
Mina, how do I get there?
If there is a Sabbath, there will be many witches.
They'll be too powerful.
They'll kill you, Hansel.
I don't have time for this.
No, listen, Hansel, I found something here, in this cave.
Something very powerful.
Something that could help us.
The Abramelin Grimoire! It exists!
This is the book of protection against black magic.
I can't believe this.
Where did you find it?
Don't ask, kid. If this thing does what it says, it will allow us to penetrate their protection.
Oh, yeah?
Their wands won't protect them anymore.
We just need something to bless.
Okay, let's start with this.
I hope this works.
All right.
You ever shoot a gun?
Well, I did win the county fair three times.
All right.
In that case...
Don't touch the gun.
Edward.
What are you doing here?
What's going on?
Muriel.
Edward,
I need your help.
Please, Edward.
- Hey!
You filthy oaf!
Get the children.
We're moving out.
It's time.
Okay, are we good?
Yes.
Well, as far as you go, kid.
But, I will leave you with this.
- Wow!
- Find a place to hide.
Shoot anything that moves.
Good luck.
Shut up!
After tonight, no sister will be burned on their pyres!
No sister will be ashes on the ground!
I want your brains!
And now, now we feast!
- That's a lot of witches.
Okay.
I'm gonna go down around the other side.
Push them into the middle, get them away from the kids.
Now, when you see my signal, you unleash hell.
Wish me luck.
Wait. Wait.
What's the signal?
It'll be me blowing one of these bitches' heads off.
Yes.
The hour has come!
The Blood Moon arrives!
- The Grand White Witch dies!
Excuse me!
Excuse me, ladies.
Hi.
It seems as if I've lost my invitation to your little dinner party here.
I apologize.
But don't worry.
I didn't come empty-handed.
Sisters!
Allow me to introduce you to the famous witch hunter Hansel.
Personally responsible for the deaths of over 600.
Listen to me carefully!
If you let my sister and the children go now,
I'll consider not killing each and every one of you.
Enough with this.
- Take his fucking head off.
- Yes.
Please work.
We have to hurry.
You get the children.
I'll get her heart!
Now, move!
Fucking...
Eat it!
Walk!
Move it!
Come on!
- Gretel!
Edward.
Gretel!
I'm okay!
Go get the children!
Stay still!
Get off of me!
No!
Thank you!
- Shit!
- Too late.
Gretel!
Thank you.
- You okay?
Muriel's still alive.
I'm not done.
Ah, Gretel, Mina.
Mina, Gretel.
- Hey.
- I need that.
- Okay.
- She flew off that way.
Well, where are you going?
I have to help Edward!
Edward.
Who the fuck's Edward?
- Ah! Hell, yeah!
- Ben!
Hansel!
Hansel!
I did it!
I shot her!
Muriel.
- Where?
- Uh, I shot her down, over there.
Good job.
She's close.
Edward?
Oh, you can't be serious.
Is this...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Wow.
Whatever you do, don't eat the fucking candy.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Stop right there, or the little boy dies.
I thought it would be fitting for us to end up here, where it all began.
Kind of lost its charm a little, huh?
Drop it.
Good boy.
Don't worry, kid.
I'm not gonna let her hurt you.
Oh, really?
Really.
The end is near, witch hunter.
I wish I could say it would be painless, but that would be a lie.
Get away from him.
Always funny seeing a white witch with a wand.
What are you going to do?
Hit me with your love spell?
Not bad.
Sacrificing yourself to save a human.
Pathetic.
No!
Mina.
Hey.
Come here.
Hansel.
Hansel.
I tried to stop her.
You did.
You did good.
You did good.
I want you to do something for me.
Anything.
Kill the fucking bitch.
You got to be fucking kidding me.
Oh, please.
Please?
Please, stop.
Please.
Yeah, nice try.
I fucking hate you.
You know, you look like shit.
You know that?
- So do you.
Finish her already.
Revenge doesn't change the past.
It won't bring our parents back.
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.
- Glad to hear it. - Ow!
But it sure as hell feels good.
My sister and I know the truth.
We know who we are now.
And so do they.
They know our story, our powers, what we can do.
And they should fear us.
All of us.
We should be getting close now.
And so after this next one, we've got three more to go.
Three?
You said three more three witches ago.
Come on, you always say, more witches, more money, right?
Yeah, but you ain't getting any of it.
Unless you want to pull the cart.
Right, big guy?
I told you he'd come in handy.
There are good witches in the world.
We know that now.
But for the ones practicing the black arts, beware.
We're coming for you.
No matter where you are, we'll find you.
And dead or alive, we'll take you down.
Edward, want to knock?
- Dead.
I hate to break it to you, but it's not gonna be an open casket.
Please verify that the P-one ATA removal on replacement cap part one and two are complete.
DMA M-one, M-two, M-three and M four are complete.
- Okay. Copy that, Explorer.
Dr. Stone, Houston.
Medical is concerned about your ECG readings.
I'm fine, Houston.
- Well, Medical doesn't agree, Doc.
Are you feeling nauseous?
- Not any more than usual, Houston.
Diagnostics are green.
Link to communications card ready for data reception.
If this works, when we touch down tomorrow, I'm buying all you guys a round of drinks.
That's a date, Doctor.
Just remember, Houston's partial to margaritas.
Booting comms card now.
Please confirm link.
That's a negative, we're not seeing any data.
Standby, Houston, I'm gonna reboot the comms card.
Standing by.
Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.
- Please expand. Okay, let me tell you a story.
It was ninety-six.
I'd been up here for forty-two days.
Every time I passed over Texas, I looked down knowing that Mrs. Kowalski was looking up, thinking of me.
Six weeks I'm blowing kisses at that woman.
Then we land at Edwards and I find out that she's run off with this lawyer.
So, I packed my car, and I headed to... - ...
Tijuana. You've told this story, Kowalski.
As Houston recalls, she, uh, took off in your seventy-four GTO.
Engineering requests fuel status on the jetpack prototype.
Five hours off the reservation and I show thirty percent drain.
Give my compliments to Engineering.
Except for a slight malfunction in the nulling of the roll axis, this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust.
Engineering says thank you.
Tell 'em I still prefer my sixty-seven Corvette, though.
Speaking of which, did I ever tell you...
- We know the Corvette story, Matt.
Even Engineering?
- Especially Engineering.
We're going to miss you, Matt.
Comms card reboot in progress.
- Thank you, Doctor.
Shariff, what's your status?
Nearly there. Replacing battery module A-one and C.
Ccould you be a little more specific?
Indeterminate estimates make Houston anxious.
No, Houston.
Don't be anxious.
Anxiety's not good for the heart.
System is ready to reactivate.
Hubble telescope engaged.
Upgrade fully functional. That applause you hear is for you, Shariff.
Congratulations. Kick back, take the rest of the day off.
Matt, do you have a visual on just what Mission Specialist Shariff is doing up there?
He appears to be doing some form of the Macarena.
But that would be just a best-guess scenario on my part.
Medical now have you with a temperature drop to thirty-five-point-nine and a heart-rate rise to seventy.
How are you feeling?
- Houston, I'm fine.
It's just keeping your lunch down in zero-G is harder than it looks.
Dr. Stone, Medical is asking if you want to return to Explorer.
Negative. We've been here a week, Houston.
Let's just finish this.
Card is up.
- No, that's a negative.
I'm afraid we're getting nothing on this end, Doctor.
Try again.
- No, still nothing.
Houston, can you please turn that music off?
Not a problem.
Thank you, Kowalski.
Now, Houston?
- That's a negative.
Could Houston be misinterpreting the data?
Well, we're not receiving any data.
Engineering is recommending a vis-check for component damage.
Let me see what's going on.
What have we got?
Visual examination doesn't reveal any damaged components.
The problem must be originating from the comms panel.
Yeah, that seems to be the case.
Engineering admits that you warned us that this could happen.
That's as close to an apology as you're going to get from them.
We should have listened to you, Doc.
Get working. - Well, ooks like we're going to have to improvise.
I'm on it.
- How long do you think it'll take you?
One hour.
- Outstanding.
Installing your system in the Hubble is the purpose of this mission and so we appreciate your patience, Doctor.
Kowalski, we... we know you don't care about things like this, but, uh, for your information, this delay is not gonna be long enough for you to break Anatoly Solovyev's spacewalking record.
It seems like you're gonna be left...
- Seventy-five minutes shy?
Never crossed my mind.
Matt... it's been a privilege.
- Right back at you, Houston.
Enjoy your last walk.
Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone in removing the panel?
Assistance appreciated.
- Permission granted.
Thank you, Houston.
Mind if I join the fun?
- Certainly. How you feeling?
Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble-dried.
Well, it's been a rough week.
If it makes you feel any better, I coughed up everything but my kidneys on my first ride.
Shit.
Sorry.
I'm used to a basement lab in a hospital where things fall to the floor.
Thank you.
Well, you're the genius up here.
I only drive the bus.
Yeah, well, call me a genius if I can get this board initialized in the next hour.
Explorer, this is Houston.
- Go ahead, Houston.
NORAD reports a Russian satellite has incurred a missile strike.
The impact has created a cloud of debris orbiting at twenty thousand miles per hour.
Current debris orbit does not overlap with your trajectory.
We'll keep you posted on any developments.
Should we...
Should we be worried? - No, let's let the boys down there worry for us.
Explorer, engage arm and pivot to cargo bay.
Stand by for arm maneuver.
So, doc, now that you work for NASA, how do you like us?
Kind of like winning the lottery, huh?
I was just happy that they didn't cut the funding to my research.
How long was your training?
- Six months.
Including holidays?
- Mm-hm. So, what is this scanning system?
- Oh, nothing Matt.
It's just a new set of eyes to scan the edge of the universe.
It's designed for hospital use, but this one's a prototype.
Stand by for locking.
Listen, they don't bankroll prototypes.
Even for your pretty blue eyes.
Well, my eyes are brown.
Right now, your eyes are bloodshot.
Kowalski!
Is this great, or what?
And to think he went to Harvard.
You gotta admit one thing:
Can't beat the view.
So, what do you like about being up here?
The silence.
I could get used to it.
Terrific.
Houston, from first inspection, comms panel appears to be dead.
Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary?
You're the expert, doctor.
It's your call. Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.
Please elaborate.
- It's the same feeling I had about Mardi Gras in 1987.
That is affirmative.
Surprisingly, Control hasn't heard the Mardi Gras story.
Please proceed.
Well, it's day one, and I'm bumping my way down Bourbon Street looking for a sister of a friend of mine.
Streets are full of people. I'm thinking there's no way I'm gonna find this girl.
Proceeding to override.
- Then all of the sudden, I look up, and there she is, and I'm about to yell out, and I see she's holding hands with some short, hairy guy in board shorts and a Margaritaville shirt.
And then I realize that this guy is not a guy.
That my girl is holding hands with a...
ISS, this is Houston. - Proceed, Houston.
Explorer, this is Houston.
- Go ahead, Houston.
Mission abort.
Repeat. Mission abort.
Initiate emergency disconnect from Hubble.
Begin reentry procedure.
ISS, initiate emergency evacuation.
Copy all, Houston, and in work.
Matt, immediate return to Explorer.
Repeat, immediate return to Explorer.
- Copy. Explorer, prep airlock.
- Airlock engaged, ready to receive.
- Houston, elaborate.
Debris from the missile strike has caused a chain reaction, hitting other satellites and creating new debris.
Traveling faster than a high-speed bullet up towards your altitude.
All copy?
- Copy all.
Put a bow on it, Dr. Stone.
- I can't. The board is still initializing.
- I'm not gonna ask you again.
One second.
- Not one second.
Now.
Shut it down.
That's an order.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm done.
I'm done. Kowalski, initiate emergency disconnect from the Hubble.
All right, Shariff, let's do this.
- Roger, Matt. Houston, update.
- Well, we have a full-on chain reaction.
It's been confirmed that it's the unintentional side effect of the Russians striking one of their own satellites.
They shot down their own satellite?
- Right of disposal.
Most likely a spy sat gone bad.
Now it's shrapnel.
Explorer, ready to disengage HST.
Locks releasing in three... two... one.
- Explorer, new data coming through.
What's the blowback, Houston?
- It's not good.
Most of our systems are gone.
Debris chain reaction is out of control and rapidly expanding.
Multiple satellites are down, and they keep on falling.
Define 'multiple satellites. '
- Most of them are gone.
Telecommunication systems are dead.
Expect a communication blackout at any moment.
Kowalski, visual of debris at nine o'clock.
- Half of North America just lost their Facebook.
Explorer, repeat, expect a communication blackout at any moment.
Copy that, Houston.
- Explorer, this is Kowalski, confirming visual contact with debris.
Debris is from a BSE sat.
- Heads up!
To repeat, I have...
- Dr. Stone requesting faster transport.
We have to go. We have to go, go, go!
Kennedy reports meteorologicalconditions no-go for re-entry.
Houston, Explorer.
Copy.
Explorer, Dr. Stone requesting faster transport to bay area.
Explorer, do you copy?
- Explorer, permission to retrieve Dr. Stone.
You're a go, Kowalski.
Houston, this is Explorer, copy.
All right.
- We've lost Houston.
We've lost Houston.
Unstrap.
Look, we need to get the hell out of here.
- All right. Need some help there, Matt?
- No, don't wait for us.
- It's stuck!
Man down!
Man down!
Houston, this is Explorer, copy.
Houston, this is Explorer, copy.
Kowalski, repor...
Explorer's been hit!
- Explorer, do you read?
Explorer, over!
Explorer!
Astronaut is off structure!
Dr. Stone is off structure!
Dr. Stone, detach!
- No! - You must detach!
If you don't detach, that arm's gonna carry you too far!
Listen to my voice!
You need to focus!
I'm losing visual of you.
In a few seconds, I won't be able to track you.
You need to detach!
I can't see you anymore! Do it now!
- I'm trying!
I'm trying!
I'm trying!
Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone.
Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone.
Dr. Stone, do you copy?
Repeat, do you copy?
Yes, yes, yes. I copy! I'm detached!
- Give me your position.
I don't know! I don't know!
I'm spinning!
I can't...
I can't... Report your position.
- GPS is down.
It's down, I can't...
Give me a visual.
- I told you, nothing.
I see nothing!
Do you have a visual of Explorer? - No.
No.
- Do you have a visual of ISS?
- No.
You need to focus.
Anything, use the sun and the Earth, give me coordinates.
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!
Give me coordinates!
Kowalski?
Kowalski, do you copy?
Kowalski...
I have... have a vis...
Kowalski, I have a visual.
I have... have a visual of Explorer.
With north at... twelve o'clock and the shuttle is at the center of the dial.
I can see... I can see the Chinese station.
No, it's the International Space Station.
ISS is at...
ISS is at seven o'clock.
Lieutenant Kowalski, do you copy?
Explorer, do you... do you copy?
Houston, do you copy?
Houston, this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone.
I am off structure and I am drifting. Do you copy?
Anyone?
Anybody?
Do you copy?
Please copy.
Please.
Dr. Stone, do you copy?
- Yeah, Lieutenant Kowalski, yes.
Yes, Lieutenant Kowalski, I'm here, I'm here.
- Repeat, do you copy?
Yes, yes, I copy, I'm here!
I'm here.
- Flash your light.
My light... my light?
- Flash it so I can see you.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Here, here!
I'm here!
There you are.
Hang on tight.
Report your status.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm all right.
Your status.
Give me your readings.
Three... three... three point six PSI.
- Your O2, give me your O2.
Oxygen is going down. It's going down fast.
It's going down fast.
Nine...
No, eight-eight percent.
Okay, you're breathing too fast. - Eight three point nine percent.
You're burning oxygen, and we don't want to do that.
We want to relax. Copy?
- Okay, sorry.
Yes, copy, copy.
All right.
Nearly there.
- Please hurry.
You can holster that torch, Dr. Stone.
Gotcha.
All right, now I'm gonna tether you to me.
I know, you never realized how devastatingly good-looking I am.
But I need you to stop staring and help me with the tether.
Okay?
- Okay, okay.
I got it.
All right, here we go.
All right.
Now, to clear you from the jets... I'm gonna give you a little push.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no. - Not a push.
No, no. - A nudge.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Damn it, no!
See?
Where you go, I go.
Better.
Let's get outta here.
Goddamn it.
- I know what you mean.
Damn it.
- You're burning oxygen.
We're going back to the shuttle.
How's that for a plan?
Fuck!
- Right.
Copy that.
Houston, in the blind.
This is Kowalski.
Dr. Stone and I are gonna make our way back to base.
Can you get the Explorer to prepare the airlock for arrival? Copy?
Houston, this is...
Kowalski.
How do you copy?
Houston, in the blind.
This is Kowalski.
They can't hear us.
- We don't know that.
That's why we keep talking.
If somebody is listening, they might just save your life.
Set your watch for ninety minutes.
- Why ninety?
Well, Houston clocked that debris at fifty thousand miles an hour.
If you factor in our current orbit, then I figure we got about ninety minutes before we get our asses kicked again.
O2 down to six percent.
- Okay. Pretty scary shit being untethered up here, isn't it?
Yeah, pretty scary shit.
- Well, you did all right.
Well, you weren't so bad yourself.
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.
Our current location is approximately nine hundred meters out from the Explorer.
Dr. Stone and I would like to retrieve the body of Mission Specialist Shariff and return it to the shuttle.
Am I a go to retrieve?
Roger that.
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Grab him!
Grab him!
- I'm trying, I'm trying!
You're pullin' me away.
- Got... I got him!
Clutch him like he's your Valentine. - I got him. Okay.
I got him.
I can't engage my thrust with you two yo-yoin' around.
Here's hopin' you have a hell of an insurance policy, Houston.
The damages to Explorer are catastrophic.
Will commence search for survivors.
O2 down to five percent.
All right, here we go. Careful of the edges!
Here. Here!
Houston, in the blind. To confirm.
Mission Specialist Dr. Stone and Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski are the sole survivors of the STS-one-five-seven.
I apologize for not complying.
I should've stopped working as soon as you instructed me to.
We were gonna get hit no matter what.
There was nothing you could do to change that.
Hey.
- Yes?
All right, we have to make our way to the Space Station.
Over there.
It's a bit of a hike, but we need to use their escape pod, the Soyuz, to get back to Earth.
Agreed?
Dr. Stone, agreed?
Agreed.
- All right.
After you.
Oh, God.
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.
Dr. Stone and I have determined to proceed to ISS and use one of their Soyuz for re-entry.
ISS, if you hear us... we could sure use a rescue mission.
O2 down to two percent.
- We're getting there.
Beautiful, don't you think?
What?
The sunrise.
That's what I'm gonna miss the most.
So where's home, Dr. Stone?
Ryan, where's home?
Home?
Down there.
Mother Earth.
Where do you pitch you tent?
Lake Zurich.
- Where the hell is that?
Illinois.
- Illinois.
Central Time Zone.
That would make it roughly... eight PM.
What are the good people of Lake Zurich doing at eight o'clock?
I don't know.
I'm not gonna make it. I'm slowing you down.
- What would you be doing?
Come on, Ryan.
It's eight o'clock.
You've just left the hospital after an eighteen-hour shift.
Driving home.
The radio.
I listen to the radio.
- There we go.
Let me guess.
NPR?
Classical?
Top forty?
Anything.
I don't care, as long as they don't talk.
I just drive.
And where are you driving to?
I just drive.
- What do you miss down there?
Is there a Mr. Stone?
No.
- Nobody special?
Somebody down there looking up, thinking about you?
Ryan?
I had a daughter.
She was four.
She was at school playing tag.
Slipped, hit her head, and that was it.
Stupidest thing.
I was driving when I got the call, so...
Ever since then, that's what I do.
I wake up, I go to work, and I just drive.
O2 down to one percent.
Well, I've got good news and bad news.
The good news is, we're about five minutes from the ISS and I know where the Russians stash their vodka.
And that is good, because I'm runnin' on fumes here.
The bad news is, I'm gonna be about ten minutes short of breakin' Anatoly's record, and I...
What?
- I'm redlining.
My O2 tank pressure is low.
Your tank is out of oxygen but you still have it in your suit.
So you have to sip, not gulp.
Wine, not beer.
Sip, Ryan.
Houston, in the blind, we have a visual of the ISS.
The station must have been evacuated because the first Soyuz is missing.
The second Soyuz exhibits surface damage, and its chute has been deployed.
Any use as an escape pod for re-entry is impossible.
Shouldn't we be turning?
We're drifting again.
Not yet.
I wasn't kidding about those fumes.
This can has one or two good thrusts left... if we're lucky.
Steady.
Aim.
Fire!
Brake!
Brake!
You have to brake!
- I can't, the can's empty. We're gonna hit hard!
Grab a hold of anything you can!
What do I do?
What do I do? !
The tether broke, I'm detached!
I'm detached!
Grab a hold!
Grab anything!
Ryan!
Give me five!
- I've got you.
I've got you.
Right here, right here.
Shit!
- No. No, no, no...
Got ya.
Got ya.
You just... hold on and I'm gonna start pulling you in.
I'm gonna start... Hey, Doc.
- Just hold on. Hang on.
I am gonna pull you in. Ryan, listen.
- I'm gonna pull you in.
- You have to let me go.
- No.
The ropes are too loose.
I'm pulling you with me.
You have to let me go, or we both die.
I'm not letting you go!
We're fine!
- No.
Ryan, let me go.
- No. No.
You're not going anywhere. You're not going anywhere.
It's not up to you.
- No, no, no, no...
Please don't do this.
Please, please, please, please don't do this.
Please don't do this.
No, no, no.
Please don't, Matt.
Please don't do this.
You're gonna make it, Ryan.
No!
I had you. I had you!
I had you.
Ryan, do you hear me?
Do you copy?
- My CO2 alarm went off.
My CO2 alarm went off.
- Look, you need to board the station.
Do you see the airlock?
Hey, Ryan, you copy?
Look for the airlock.
It's above you, next to the Zarya module.
You see it?
- Yes.
Yes, I see it. I see it.
- Good. That's where you want to go.
Now you're getting lightheaded, right?
Yeah. Yes.
- That's because you're breathing CO2.
You're losing consciousness.
You need to board the station.
- Okay.
That second Soyuz is too damaged for re-entry, but it's perfectly fine for a little Sunday drive.
Sunday drive?
Look to the west.
You see that dot in the distance?
That's a Chinese station.
- Yes.
You're gonna take the Soyuz, and you're gonna cruise over there.
Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzhou.
I've never flown a Shenzhou.
- It doesn't matter.
Its re-entry protocol is identical to the Soyuz.
Okay.
You never flown the Soyuz either?
- Only a simulator.
Well, then you know.
- But I crashed it.
It's a simulator, that's what it's designed for.
Every time.
I crashed it every time.
You point the damn thing at Earth.
It's not rocket science.
And by this time tomorrow, you're gonna be back in Lake Zurich with a hell of a story to tell.
You copy?
Ryan, you copy?
- I'm gonna take the Soyuz and come get you.
No, you're not.
- I'm coming to get you
No, I've got too much of a head start on you.
- I'm coming to get you.
I'm afraid that ship already sailed.
Ryan, you're gonna have to learn to let go.
But I...
- I want to hear you say you're gonna make it...
Come on, Ryan, say it.
I'm gonna make it.
- All right.
Keep going.
What kind of name is Ryan for a girl?
Dad wanted a boy.
- Are you close to the airlock?
Not yet.
- Keep going.
So now that we have some distance between us... you're attracted to me, right?
- What?
Well, people say I have beautiful blue eyes.
You have beautiful...
You have beautiful blue eyes.
I have brown eyes.
You want to know the good news?
- What?
I'm gonna break Anatoly's record, and I think mine's gonna stand for a long, long time.
No.
I'm coming to get you.
Oh, my God.
- What? What?
Wow.
Hey, Ryan?
- Yeah?
You should see the sun on the Ganges.
It's amazing.
Where are you? Where are you?
Comms.
Comms.
There you are.
Okay. Matt, this is Ryan, copy.
Matt, this is Ryan, copy.
Matt, I made it, I'm here, I'm on the station. Do you copy?
Come on, Matt, talk to me.
Tell me where you are, give me your position.
Where are you?
Give me a visual.
Just tell me what you see.
Come on.
You've been yammering since we left Cape Canaveral, and now you decide to shut up?
Talk to me.
Just say something, say anything! I don't care!
Hey, tell me about, uh, Mardi Gras.
Tell me about the hairy guy. Huh?
Tell me what happened.
What happened to the hairy guy?
Please talk to me.
Please.
Houston, in the blind... this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone reporting from the ISS.
All communications with Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski have been lost.
Radio transmission absent.
Visuals nonexistent.
To confirm, I, Ryan Stone, am the sole survivor of STS-one-five-seven.
What now?
Okay.
Okay.
Where is it, where is it?
Where is the power?
Great, just like training.
Undocking, undocking.
Undocking.
Okay.
Okay, where is it?
Where is it?
Come on.
Okay.
Okay, I remember this, I remember this.
You don't have four minutes.
We're going manual.
Come on.
Okay.
Active-Activate, undock.
Seven minutes to get out of here.
All right, okay.
What... what?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Stop! Stop!
That's right, that's right.
That's right, that's right, that's right.
Come on.
Great.
Clear skies with a chance of satellite debris.
Okay, we detach this, and we go home. Piece of cake.
Okay.
Okay, what do we have?
Okay, all right.
Shit.
Okay, come on.
Come on, come on.
All right.
I hate space.
Shut up.
Okay.
All right.
That's good.
Okay.
Let's stabilize you.
Okay.
Let's go visit the Chinese station.
Houston, in the blind,
Tiangong is approximately one hundred kilometers to the west, and I am off its course by about thirteen degrees.
I will correct trajectory.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I will engage S-Ka-Dae in five... four... three... two... one.
What's happening, what's happening? Come on, come on.
One.
Come on, come on.
You gotta be kidding me.
You gotta be kidding me!
Don't you fuck...
Houston, in the blind.
Houston, in the blind, this is Dr. Ryan Stone.
I'm calling from the Soyuz TMA-one-four-M.
I'm currently out of fuel and adrift, do you copy?
Houston.
This is Dr. Ryan Stone.
Do you copy?
Houston.
This is Ryan Stone.
Do you copy?
Houston, this is Missish...
Mission Specialist Ryan Stone, do you copy?
Houston, Houston, please confirm identity.
Houston, you're coming in over an A.M. frequency.
Do you copy?
Is this the Chinese station?
Is this Tiangong?
Copy.
Mayday, can you copy?
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Yes, yes.
Mayday, mayday.
Mayday, mayday.
Aningaaq.
Is that...?
Is that your...?
Is that your name?
Aningaaq is your... is your name?
Is that your name?
Mayday!
No, no, no. No, my name is not 'Mayday. ' I'm Stone.
Dr. Ryan Stone, I need help.
I am...
Those are dogs.
They're calling from Earth.
They're calling from Earth.
Aningaaq, make your dogs bark again for me, would you please?
Your dogs.
Dogs, you know.
Woof, woof.
Dogs.
Oh, I'm gonna die, Aningaaq.
I know, we're all gonna die.
Everybody knows that.
But I'm gonna die today.
Funny, that.
You know, to know...
But the thing is, it's that I'm still scared.
I'm really scared.
Nobody will mourn for me, no one will pray for my soul.
Will you mourn for me?
Will you say a prayer for me?
Or is it too late?
I mean, I'd say one for myself, but I've never prayed in my life, so...
Nobody ever taught me how.
Nobody ever taught me how.
A baby.
There's a baby with you, huh?
Is that a lullaby you're singing?
That's so sweet.
I used to sing to my baby.
I hope I see her soon.
That's nice, Aningaaq.
Keep singing, just like that.
Sing me to sleep, and I'll sleep.
Keep singing.
And sing, and sing.
No, no, no, don't!
Check your watch. Thirteen hours and eleven minutes.
Call Anatoly and tell him he's been bumped.
It's a little gloomy in here, isn't it? - How did you...?
Trust me, it's a hell of a story.
- But how did...?
That's better.
I found a little extra...
a little extra battery power.
It helps that I didn't have you around to distract me.
I have to say, I'm glad to see ya.
I didn't think you were gonna make it.
Did you find the vodka?
You never told me where... where it was, so... - Well...
To Anatoly.
Huh? - No.
- No?
All right.
Let's get out of here.
The Chinese station's about a hundred miles.
Just a little Sunday drive. We can't.
- Sure we can.
There's no fuel, I tried everything. Well, there's always something we can do.
- I tried everything.
Did you try the soft landing jets?
They're for landing. So...
- Well, landing is launching.
It's the same thing.
Didn't you learn about that in training?
I never got to land the simulator. I told you that.
But you know about it.
- And I crashed it every time.
Listen, do you want to go back, or do you want to stay here?
I get it, it's nice up here.
You can just shut down all the systems, turn out all the lights... and just close your eyes and tune out everybody.
There's nobody up here that can hurt you.
It's safe.
I mean, what's the point of going on? What's the point of living?
Your kid died.
Doesn't get any rougher than that.
But still, it's a matter of what you do now.
If you decide to go, then you gotta just get on with it.
Sit back, enjoy the ride.
You gotta plant both your feet on the ground and start livin' life.
How did you get here?
- I'm telling you, it's a hell of a story.
Hey, Ryan?
- What?
It's time to go home.
Landing...
Landing...
Landing is launching.
I said...
Okay, landing, landing.
Landing is green.
Okay.
Okay, landing.
All right.
Okay.
Soft landing jets trigger automatically at three meters before landing, so...
You're a clever son of a bitch, Matt.
I need to...
I need to get rid of the B.O... and the engine module.
Right. Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Tri-module separation.
Go.
Okay.
Houston, here's the tricky part.
Soyuz has to think we are three meters off the Earth.
All right. Okay.
Hey, Matt?
Since I had to listen to endless hours of your storytelling this week,
I need for you to do me a favor.
You are gonna see a little girl with brown hair, very messy, lots of knots.
She doesn't like to brush it.
That's okay.
Her name is Sarah.
Can you please tell her that Mama found her red shoe?
She was so worried about that shoe, Matt.
But it was just right under the bed.
Give her a big hug and a big kiss for me, and tell her that Mama misses her.
You tell her that she is my angel.
And she makes me so proud.
So, so proud.
And you tell her that I'm not quitting.
You tell her that I love her, Matt.
You tell her that I love her so much.
Can you do that for me?
Roger that?
Here we go.
You're losing altitude, Tiangong.
You keep dropping and you're gonna kiss the atmosphere.
But not without me, because you're my last ride.
Wait.
Five... four... three...
No more just driving.
Let's go home.
Okay, come on, come on.
Steady, steady.
Come on.
Come on.
Forty-five, ninety, one-eighty.
Come on.
Okay, okay.
Damn it.
Shit!
Come on. Shenzhou, come on. Shenzhou.
Shenzhou.
Fuck!
Okay, this way.
In the Soyuz, the power button is here.
Okay, undocking, undocking.
Eeni, meeni...
Okay, that doesn't sound good.
Miny, meeni... moe.
Miny... moe.
Okay. Okay, good.
Houston.
Houston, in the blind.
This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone reporting from the Shenzhou.
I'm about to undock from Tiangong...
And I have a bad feeling about this mission.
Reminds me of a story, Houston...
Never mind the story, Houston.
Never mind the story.
It's getting hot in here. Okay.
All right.
Okay.
All right, the way I see it, there's only two possible outcomes.
Either I make it down there in one piece and I have one hell of a story to tell, or I burn up in the next ten minutes.
Either way, whichever way... no harm, no foul!
Because either way... it'll be one hell of a ride.
I'm ready.
Shenzhou, in the blind, this is Houston.
Indicate FM frequency.
Our radars detect you on a re-entry trajectory.
If you copy, please confirm identity.
This is Houston.
- Please confirm identity.
Skies over the Midwest are completely clear...
Rescue mission is on the way.
Shenzhou, in the blind, this is Houston. We've deployed a rescue mission to retrieve you.
Thank you.
Max!
Come on!
Don't keep the Sisters waiting.
This is Frey.
She's new here as well.
Can you read?
It's a giraffe.
They were from Africa.
- You can read? - Yes.
There are many robot servants, and they serve you all day.
If you live there, you never get sick or old.
- I'll take us there one day.
- Really?
Yeah, I promise.
Frey and... Max... forever.
Max, have you been stealing things again?
It breaks my heart.
Why do you do this?
So you can save up?
One day buy a ticket up to that place?
That place is not for you, or for me.
But it's not fair, Sister.
Why can't I go there?
Sometimes in life we don't understand... why things are the way they are.
But I know one thing.
I know you are special.
You will do something very important one day.
Something you were born for.
My little Max.
Off to work, huh?
Gotta get up early to work that line.
Make the world a better place.
That's real funny, I have a job.
Come on. You think I got money? Do I look like I have money?
Come on.
How about you? You got a little money? Come on.
What have you got in there? What have you got?
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Oh, it's 5 bucks.
Hey, wait a minute! I got 5 bucks. I'm rich.
I can finally buy my ticket to Elysium.
All right.
Please form an orderly queue. Your bus has arrived.
Leave me alone!
Checked.
Move on.
Good morning, officer.
Extensive criminal history.
Multiple felonies.
What's in the bag?
Hair products, mostly.
I'm just fucking with...
Hey, hey, hey. I'm just going to work. Nothing's in the fucking bag.
Come on, I...
Misdemeanor: citizen disobedience.
I'm just going to work, man.
Come on.
- Checked.
- Nothing in there, is there?
Zero tolerance policy applies to all Citizens. No shit.
You must report immediately to your parole officer.
Thank you, Citizen.
No, thank you.
Frey, fracture, Bed 2. Just let us work, okay? Let us work.
Max?
Frey.
I thought you were...
When did you get back?
Been back for a while.
I see things haven't changed.
No, this wasn't even my fault. Of course not.
Let me have a look.
Pretty bad break.
It isn't pleasant.
So you're a nurse, huh?
You did it.
Yeah.
That's great.
You still stealing cars? No.
God, no. I don't do any of that stupid shit anymore.
I work at Armadyne. On the line, working my way up.
They need you on the third floor.
So, you know, now that you're back... Just a second, Max.
Two seconds.
Dominica. Can you take over here?
Hey, listen. Now, you know, because you're back and everything... Max, I'm so sorry.
I have to go.
It's good to see you. Stay out of trouble.
I do.
Look, I get it.
I know why you left the neighborhood. I understand.
If I was as smart as you, I would have left too.
Have dinner with me. Just...
All right. Look, I'll settle for a coffee.
- No.
- Oh, Jesus.
I gotta break my other arm to get attention? - Stop. Stop.
- Because I will do that.
My life is complicated, Max.
I just... I... I...
I miss you.
My shift ends at 8 on Wednesday, okay? Yeah.
All right.
- Coffee.
- Yeah, coffee.
Right.
Get out of here.
All parolees must pass Weapons inspection.
Hello.
I'd just like to explain... Max Da Costa.
Violation of Penal Code 2219 today at Bus Stop 34B.
Yes, that's exactly what I wanted to talk about.
See, there was a misunderstanding.
Immediate extension of parole by eight months. Wait, what?
No, no, no.
I can explain what happened.
I just made a joke, and, you know... Stop talking.
Police officers noted violent and antisocial behavior.
We regretfully must extend parole.
Elevation in heart rate detected.
Would you like a pill? No.
Thank you.
- I'd like to explain... - Stop talking.
Personality matrix suggests a 78.3 percent chance of regression... to old behavior patterns:
Grand theft auto. Assault with a deadly weapon. Resisting arrest.
Would you like to talk to a human?
No, I am okay, thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic and/or abusive? - Negative.
It is a federal offense to abuse a parole officer.
Understood.
Da Costa. No Weapons detected.
- You're late for your shift.
- I had a thing...
No, you can't work with that.
You're out.
No, no, no.
I'm good, man. I can work.
This comes off today.
I'm fine.
- You're good?
- I'm good.
Okay. I'm docking you half a day.
Yeah, all right.
You're lucky to have this job.
No Weapons detected.
You are clear for entry.
Please keep your Workstation tidy.
A tidy Workstation is an efficient Workstation.
Check it out, man. I think he likes you.
Think he got his face peel today? He looks good.
Attention.
All workers must reach weekly quotas.
Please report any unsafe activity to your supervisor.
If we don't have a clear path to upside... our investors are going to start losing a lot of confidence.
What do you think I've been doing down on Earth?
You think I enjoy breathing this air? No, of course...
I am doing everything possible to restore profitability to this company.
The company that I built.
Now, if you will excuse me...
I have to not speak to you people any longer. Thank you.
Closing 34.
Fire in 34.

We hacked three transponder codes, Spider. Okay.
Pull them up on-screen.
Codes have been accepted. Fire up the shuttles!
We are going UP!
- Welcome.
- Hello, madam.
Take a look at the garden.
We will. Thank you.
Yes, I understand...
My, how you've grown!
Are the children here?
Yes, with Dominica.
I have a present for you.
Go and get it with your mother.
It's next to the couch.
Ma'am, would you care for a refreshment?
Cancel.

What up, man?
What happened?
- The police.
- You okay?
Don't worry about it.
Max, I gotta talk to you.
Okay, you know...
- No.
- What do you mean, no?
You didn't hear what I was gonna say.
All right. Go ahead. Go ahead.
You know the house of Los Zetas, up on the hill?
Yeah, the one with all the guns.
Yeah. They have five cars.
New ones.
It's gonna be three of us.
Tomorrow at lunch.

The time is 5:50 a.m.
No weapons detected.
You are clear for entry.
Closing 34.
Hey. You're holding up the line.
No. No, no. I got a jam.
Attention.
Workers may not visit the restroom more than once per shift.
What have you done, Da Costa?
No, I'm just trying to reset. Let me look.
-Let me look.
- The pallet's pinched.
- Yeah, it moved.
- Just go in there.
- No. I mean...
Look, either you go in there right now or I'll find someone who will...
- ...and you can clean out your locker.
- Come on. No. That's the deal, okay?
In you go.
Let's go, people. Back to work.
Fuck.
No, no. No, no, no! No.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey, come on, you guys.
It's too late. It's too late, come on.
Extraction!
They started the fight, Sister.
I just want to live there.
You see how beautiful it looks to us from here?
Yes.
Well...
Now look how beautiful we look from there.
Keep it.
This is yours now.
To never forget about where you come from.
What happened?
You have been exposed to a lethal dose of radiation.
You will experience catastrophic organ failure.
In five days' time, you will die.
What is going on?
Why has production stopped?
He's been exposed.
Don't breathe on me.
Cover your mouth.
I'm sorry, sir.
Does his skin fall off or something?
I don't want to replace the bedding. Get him out.
- Yes, sir.
- Great. Thank you.
Mr. Carlyle, your shuttle is ready for departure.
Please sign this to receive medication.
Miporol, extremely potent, will keep you functioning normally until your death.
Please take one pill with each meal.
Thank you for your service.
At 1500 hours yesterday, you shot down two shuttles, killing 46 civilians.
Your mandate is to deal with illegals quietly.
I am aware of that.
And then there's the use of this... agent, a Mr. M. Kruger.
Fifteen human rights violations.
Rapes. Kidnappings. Torture.
The man's been diagnosed with serious psychological issues.
We made it explicitly clear to you... that we are no longer using sleeper agents.
Tell me something, President Patel.
Do you have children?
I am not the one being reviewed here.
Then I will assume you do not.
Perhaps if you did have children, then you would behave in a manner... that is more conducive to the longevity of this habitat.
I understand that it is not the fashion to think and to act as I do.
I understand that perfectly.
But when they come for your house, for the house you built for your children... and your children's children... it won't be PR and campaign promises that keep them out.
It will be me.
I've heard enough.
This is your final warning.
Any further unauthorized actions, and you will be removed from office.
And let's discharge this Agent Kruger permanently.
All in favor?
Good.
Effective immediately.
You want some beer?
You have been discharged from CCB.
Please return all weapons to the local embassy.
Fuck your politics, man!
Fuck you!
Max.
Max.
What happened?
Jesus. Let me help you. Let's go in, come on.
Max, what happened? Jesus.
Max. What happened?
I shouldn't have gone in, man. Go in where?
I took a full dose, man. I got a full dose.
You're gonna be okay.
Let me help.
You're gonna be okay, Max.
They gave me Miporol, man.
They gave me fucking...
Miporol.
Five fucking days, man. I only got five days.
You have to take this.
- They can fix this shit on Elysium, man. - I know.
I'm gonna go see Spider.
Max.
Max, take the pill.
There you go.
To see Spider, you need money.
I'll give you everything I have, But it's not enough for a ticket.
He's gonna give me a ticket.
He's gonna give me a fucking ticket.
Frey, we've done everything we could to help your daughter.
I met with the board today and they recommend we send her home with you.
How can I work here and leave her at home?
It can happen any minute, Dr. Faizel.
I know. If she has another seizure, of course bring her back to the ward. Of course.
But until then, she's discharged.
This isn't Elysium. We can't just heal her.
Max.
It's been a while, my brother.
How's life at the factory?
I need to ask you a favor. What?
I can't hear you.
I need a ticket up there. - And an ID.
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Sure, sure.
Absolutely.
Do you prefer aisle or window?
I'm being fucking serious, man.
Listen. I'm gonna come back. I'm gonna come back and work for you.
Anything you need, man. I'll fucking pay it back.
You know what?
This is priceless.
This is priceless. Yeah.
Let me ask you a question.
Do you have any idea how many idiots come in here... saying the same kind of bullshit?
I got little kids coming in here every day.
Max, if I were you... I'd get the fuck out of here right now.
I did three years for you.
After everything I did for you, you'll get me up there.
Can you feel this?
Go ahead and shoot.
I got so much radiation in my body, you're probably getting sick yourself.
You're really dying?
I'm fucking dying, motherfucker.
See this?
It's over.
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down!
Get out of here!
Okay?
Listen. I've been looking for someone to take a job for me.
But no one here had the balls!
You said you'd do anything, right?
Max.
- You okay? - I'm okay.
This... my friend...
This can be your ticket up there.
One last job for me, you earn your way up.
What is it?
Take an Elysian asshole, right?
A billionaire.
He's down on Earth for some business.
He's here for whatever. We hijack him. - Fuck that.
- Okay, relax.
It gets, like, much worse.
Forget his watch. Forget his ride. Forget all that shit.
This is what you take.
Organic information, right out of his head.
Now, I'm talking about bank codes, passwords, log-in data.
Access to billions.
All you have to do is plug into his brain... download the data into yours with this baby... and bring it to me.
This is crazy, Max. Come on.
Once we verify the data, I'll give you a one-way ride, all expenses paid.
Even throw in some snacks and a drink.
All you have to do is walk into a house and use the med bay... and you're cured.
Sandro will do the surgery. You know him?
What the fuck?
Jesus Christ.
I'm good.
Actually, you seem all weak and fucked up.
So you know what?
I'll have them...
This is crazy.
Let's get out of here, please. Listen to me.
- What the fuck am I gonna do?
- I'll have them install... this.
A third-generation exo-suit.
We hook this into your nervous system, it'll make you as strong as a droid.
You're already under the knife, right?
Let's get out of here. Please.
I want a four-man team, but I pick them.
I'm sending my own data wrangler.
- Brain-to-brain data is real tough.
- Okay. But I'm taking Julio.
He gets a ticket up there, same as me.
Yeah, sure. Okay.
I'll go get the boys ready.
Wait.
It's gotta be John Carlyle.
The CEO of Armadyne Carlyle?
That's the mark.
Secretary Delacourt, Mr. Carlyle has arrived.
You are here to persuade me to renew our Armadyne contracts, yes?
Astute as always.
Come with me.
I'm not interested in your little ideas.
I'm interested in something much larger.
This habitat is dying.
There is a political sickness inside of it.
A tumor that needs to be removed.
You and your company are in need of revenue... that is drying up.
So you built the torus.
Can you override the servers and place a new president in power?
A coup?
Are you suggesting a coup?
Is it possible?
I could write a reboot sequence and shut down the entire system.
And at that point... you could encode a new president, yes.
Then that is what you will do.
And you will have your contract secured for the next 200 years.
Missile defense batteries, droids. Everything we need to protect our liberty.
All guaranteed, of course, by your new president.
You have work to do, Mr. Carlyle.
This is the guy.
- This is the guy?
- This is him.
Sit down.
We're gonna out you a good one.
Play nice, Sandro. Play nice.
Let's get him an ID first.
Get the chief one of them identification codes.
Get that ready.
Arm up.
That'll merge with the DNA and you'll fit in like you were born there.
Now it's time for the real fun.
Hey, man.
Yo.
Is this gonna hurt?
Yeah, bitch, it's gonna hurt.
It's gonna hurt good.
When we're done with you, you're gonna be a favela ninja.
Marianna, hey, bring down the bone saw.
Bring the bone saw! This ain't gonna kill me.
You're gonna be all right, my brother.
Max.
I'm here.
We got this, man.
We got this.
Yeah.
Hey!
He's awake!
You made it, huh?
Surprise.
You can still jack off. How's everything going?
He's ready to kick ass.
What the fuck did you do to me?
Gave you a way out.
What's up, partner?
How's that suit working out for you, man?
That shit is tight.
Show me.
Hold that.
What's this, a family heirloom?
Wait for it.
Air-bursting ammunition.
Designate your enemy... and any round you fire will explode around them, five-meter kill radius.
And... synced detonation rounds for this bad boy.
That'll work.
Move out.
Sir?
Shuttle is ready.
Do you read me?
Here's the deal.
We'll wait outside the factory until we see his shuttle leave.
One of you puts an explosive round in it, goes to the crash site, gets the data.
Okay. Copy that.
Camera's live, boys.
You getting this, Spider?
I got it. Let's go.
Let's play ball.
- Move out of the way.
- You nervous?
- No.
No?
I'm shitting my pants.
- We're not gonna fucking die here.
GO, go:
Acceleration to supersonic speeds in 15 seconds.
Come on, come OH, come on.
Critical engine failure.
Ma'am, we have an Elysian citizen on Earth in danger.
Data coming up now.
Citizen identified. John Carlyle. N8321P...
I see you, motherfucker.
I have a situation here.
Kruger, do you read me?
Miss Delacourt, how lovely to hear your voice.
There is a citizen carrying sensitive brain data out of the city.
- Some thieves are trying to hijack it.
- What's in it?
That's classified.
You don't call a recently deactivated agent... to retrieve classified fucking information, man.
The government doesn't know about this, do they?
I can ask for whatever I want, can't I?
Please brace for impact.
Please remain calm. You have sustained zero injuries.
Oh, that's a real comfort.
I got one condition.
I do this, I get reinstated.
Fine.
I've recommissioned two of your preferred agents... completely confidentially, of course.
They should be at your position any second.
Send me the mission data.
Let's go, guys.
Out of the cars.
Droids, there appears to be some type of wheeled vehicle with one...
Two occupants... and they are armed and I'd like them dead.
Droid!
It's jammed! It's jammed!
- Identified. Max Da Costa.
Federal parole number 61492-8-557.
It's jammed, man!
Got it.
He's reloading!
You all right?
We gotta go faster.
I got the door. Go, go!
I got you covered!
GO, go!
Don't fucking move.
- Bring it! - There's another one.
Die, motherfucker!
Don't hit the mark!
No, no, no! No, no!
He got hit, he got hit!
Citizen has sustained a cardiothoracic trauma.
Blood pressure is dropping.
It's not in the head.
It's in the chest.
We're fucking good, man.
Hold his head. Hold his head.
Plug this into you. Come on, get that shit in.
- Come on, baby.
- Yes. - Is it working?
Yeah, yeah, we're syncing.
You have no idea what you're doing.
One minute to target, sir.
All right. All right, we're synced.
Come on, baby, here we go.
It's gonna work.
We got it. It's gonna work.
It's a data heist, ma'am. They're downloading now.
Guys, we got incoming.
Oh, fuck me.
Come on, guys, hurry up.
That's a Raven.
That's military.
That's all right, we got this.
Ninety-seven, 98.
- Hurry up! They're coming!
- Almost there.
Ninety-nine!
Ding, here we go!
Oh, shit. Something must be corrupted.
What the fuck?
What does that mean? Wait.
Hold on. Hold on.
I can't read the data.
- It's scrambled.
I can't read the data.
- What?
Come on, guys, we gotta move!
- What the fuck does "scrambled" mean?
- Fuck this.
No, no, no. We have to run it again! Run it another time, man!
Fucking get off me, man.
I'm fucking bailing. Please run it again.
I can't.
Get the fuck off me. Let's get out of here.
Where the fuck are you going, Sandro?
- Let's get out of here!
- Goddamn it!
Come on, Max.
Get out of there! Let's go!
We gotta go!
Come on, Max.
Come on.
Hey, boss. We got a runner.
Locked on.
Fire!
That's what I'm talking about!
Fuck, man!
Targets moving south-southwest.
Move, Max.
It's coming.
We got another one.
Okay.
This is wrong. This is all wrong, man.
Going into a holding pattern, sir.
Where do you think you're going?
Fuck! Fucker!
Come on.
No!
No. No.
No.
Get up!
Get up!
No!
We've got one assailant leaving on foot, ma'am.
They have the data.
Repeat:
The thieves have the data.
Apprehend the target at all costs. Do not damage his brain.
Let's go!
We got a runner, boys!
Time of death: 1745.
Come on, where are you hiding?
What's that?
It looks like a herd of pigs, boss.
Fuck you, man!
Find him!
Take us back to the crash site. See what they left behind.
Roger that.
Hey, boss. I think you'd better come look at this.
This is a record of what we picked up... in transfer between Carlyle and the criminal, sir.
That's why she wants it so badly.
He's got the keys to the kingdom in his fucking head.
Now we just need to find him.
I'm gonna let the girls out.
Searching grids three through 11.
I'm authorizing a full containment order.
Issue a no-fly zone for Los Angeles.
All of Los Angeles?
The murderer is still out there.
Until we apprehend him, No one leaves the surface of that city.
What the...?
Max.
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.
We can go home.
Am I better?
I'm gonna get the car, okay?
Be right back.
Frey....
Max.
Oh, my God. What happened to you?
- Shit. Let me get the medics. - No.
I can't go in there.
Max, listen to me.
You need a doctor.
I can't go in there.
People are looking for me.
They'll kill me. - I came for you.
I need your help. - Max.
You've got to go through the system to get treatment.
Please help me. I don't wanna die.
Max.
Max.
Stay awake.
I wanna see the man.
Mommy's gonna help him, okay?
Try and sleep.
Don't sleep.
Come on.
Max, you can do it, come on.
Stay awake. Let's turn you over.
Max. Max, wait.
Thank you.
Who did this to you?
Oh, no, I got...
I got hurt at work, and I had to...
I had to take a job from Spider to try to get up there and get healed.
It went bad. - I'm in trouble.
- Mommy?
Hey, sweetie. Come here.
Who's that man?
His name is Max.
Mommy knew him when he was your age.
This is Matilda.
Hi.
You can go watch cartoons, okay?
I'll be right there.
I didn't... I didn't know you had...
I'm so sorry. I need to go.
Wait, Max. Wait.
Don't leave. Wait. I shouldn't have come here.
Max.
She's dying.
She's in the final stages of leukemia.
I told you my life was complicated.
I need you to help me.
I have no idea how to do this.
How to do what?
Get her to Elysium.
- I can't help her.
I would...
- Max. I would if I could.
What about this?
Fake citizenship.
If you took her there, Could you heal her with this?
It doesn't work that way.
This is coded to me. It's locked to my DNA.
These people who are looking for me... You don't understand who these people are.
If they find me here, they will kill all of us.
The only thing I can do to help you is leave, I promise you.
- She's all I have.
- I'm sorry.
You have bandages.
Yeah, I got bandages.
What are you doing?
I don't want you to be sick.
- Do you wanna hear a story?
- No...
There once was a meerkat who lived in the jungle.
He was hungry, but he was small.
So small.
And the other big animals had all the food... because they could reach the fruits.
So he made friends with a hippopotamus to...
Okay, stop.
It doesn't end well for the meerkat.
Yes, it does, because he can stand on the hippopotamus's back... to get all the fruits that he wants.
What's in it for the hippo?
The hippo wants a friend.
I'm sorry.
Hey, boss.
I think we got him.
Land this fucking craft.
Mommy, is everything okay?
It's okay, sweetie.
Clear.
It's okay, sweetie.
Afternoon.
Sorry to come bursting into your home.
I didn't mean to traumatize your young daughter.
Me and the boys here... we're looking for a young gentleman... who was in this very house a moment ago.
We're hoping you can tell us where he went.
No.
I...
I don't know where he is.
I don't believe in committing violent acts in front of kids... so I just need you to close your eyes, sweetheart.
It's okay, sweetie.
It's okay. I really need you to tell me.
Where is he?
You remember now? - Mommy.
- Close your eyes.
Keep your fucking eyes closed.
Keep your eyes closed.
Please, I don't know where he is.
He was wounded. I helped him and he left.
Please.
Do you fucking hate that?
No loyalty nowadays, eh?
It's okay, sweetie. And what's this here?
This a hospital you running here? What's going on? - She's sick.
- She's sick?
She's sick? Let me have a look at her.
Don't touch her.
See that? Protective instinct there, eh?
I said don't touch her!
I'm trying to get a word with your child.
If you give me a second.
Bring her.
Come. Where are you taking us?
I've got something you want.
- It's okay.
- Mommy. It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.
Sit down.
Shut up.
Stop.
Hey, hey, he)'- No, no, no.
Don't shoot him, don't shoot him.
Put the guns down.
- You got something, didn't you?
- What? That's why they shut down the sky.
Come on. What is it?
Wire transfers?
Corporate intel?
You gotta have something big.
I fucking got nothing, man.
It all got scrambled.
Julio is dead.
You owe me. - Let's go fucking now!
- We can't!
The flight system is jammed!
Nobody is going up there.
- Till when?
- Till I don't fucking know.
I gotta get up there, man.
Oh, everyone needs to get up there.
My guys are working to see if we have a hope in hell... which I personally think we do not, of ever getting back online.
But for now... let's just take a look at that head of yours.
Get away from me, man.
Just look at me.
If they shut down the whole fucking sky for what's in your head... maybe the key to opening it could be in there too, right?
Come on.
All right.
They will hunt you to the edge of the Earth for this.
What is it?
It's a reboot program for Elysium.
Whoever has this has the power to override their whole system.
Open the borders.
Make everyone a citizen of Elysium.
This can save your life.
We can save everyone.
When can I go?
They're trying to hack through the signal jam, but soon.
Don't bullshit me. When can we go?
I don't know.
Five days.
Fuck you. I don't have five days.
- I got hours.
- My guys are working on it.
You're always working on it. You can't get me up there.
Why do you even try sending people up?
They just get shot down.
Not with what's in your head!
That's what I'm talking about.
We would control the system here.
We would be in charge.
We can change the course of fucking history here.
Back up, then.
What I have in my head is worth a lot to them, right?
Don't do this.
If that falls into the wrong hands, they could shut us out for good.
Listen, man, I'm going up there right now.
Now, if you can find me and I'm healed, you can have all of this.
But I'm not fucking dying.
This is wrong, Max. Don't do this.
Don't shoot him.
-Don't shoot him.
It's okay. It's okay.
I always wanted a wife.
I just couldn't quite settle down, you know.
Too much temptation.
But you...
You make me ready to settle down.
You really make me wanna settle down, baby.
Holy shit, sir.
You better take a look at this.
What?
What is it? Check this fucking oke.
Turn us around.
- Drakey?
- Yes? Open the door.
Stop right there!
You're gonna do exactly what I say or I'm gonna blow my fucking head off! - You understand?
- Yeah.
You can have everything in my head!
Just take me up there and get me in a med bay!
What I have is very valuable! We can fix you up.
Put you in a med bay, sort all this kak up.
Let's go.
We'll take you up there.
Weather's nice. Air's nice and clean.
Lekker, you'll dig it.
Don't you fucking try anything.
Step aboard.
Come meet the boys. Come, boet.
Don't be shy. They won't bite.
Let me introduce you. This is Drakey. - This is Max.
- How is it, butch?
Close up, Drakey.
Crowe, let's go.
Yes, ma'am. We apprehended the subject.
Open the skies, we're coming home.
I'll expect you in 19 minutes.
Cancel the no-fly zone.
Yes, ma'am.
What?
What is that?
What is that?
Are we back?
What the fuck is that?
Are we back?
We're back online, Spider.
Frey.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna make this right.
We've got him.
All right.
Where is he?
He's leaving Earth, heading to Elysium.
Manuel, Rico.
Get weapons.
Let's get up there.
Echo Leader 234 requesting landing in Sector 22.
Roger that, Echo Leader M-234.
You are cleared for entry.
I see you got the G-19. Hey, back the fuck up.
Back the fuck up.
- Or what? - I'll let it go.
What you gonna do, huh?
I want what's in your head, boykie.
Grab his legs!
What do you want us to do?
I want everyone... coming out of that vehicle apprehended by Homeland Security.
Evacuate everyone under Level 5 clearance out of the building now.
Matilda! I warned you of this.
An unlicensed vehicle just crashed, potentially threatening the torus.
All because of your inability to act.
Evacuate him.
Get your hands off of me.
This is an act of war.
That puts the CCB under my control.
Now, if you'd let me do my job...
I'm sure you have a fundraiser to attend.
Let's go, sir.
Max.
Take me out of here, Max!
Yeah. I'm trying!
Air quality reaching toxic levels.
Get me out of here.
It is recommended you exit the craft immediately.
- Run!
- Come here, you fucker.
Two illegals heading northeast in Zone 3.
You deal with those two.
I'll handle this poes.
Welcome to this spectacular property, sprawling over...
Error.
- No.
- No citizen detected.
Please.
She's sick. Help us.
She's gone into a coma.
Shouldn't we remove this thing?
Can't, till we get all the data.
It's wired into him neurologically.
The data is intact, yes?
Data looks intact.
Warning.
We can still pull the data out of him, which will kill him.
Oh, that's fine.
How long before you can download and turn the system online?
Not long, ma'am.
Keep everything in a restricted cloud.
Lock down all access. Starting prep right now.
And get these two out of here.
Roger that.
Crowe, you wanna go get the boss's chicks?
Yeah, boet.
Give them the runaround.
Keep them busy.
Got him.
Let's go.
All right, 50 exabytes, buddy.
You ready?
What are you taking out of him?
Hey.
What are you doing to him?
What's gonna happen to him?
Rise and shine.
- Get up.
- Max.
Max. Max! Max!
Get in there.
Boss got fucked up, eh?
Ate that fucking grenade, eh?
His brain is fine, but he's gonna be pissed when he wakes up, eh?
Remember the kak that happened in India when he lost his legs.
Kruger.
Hey, boss.
It's Crowe.
Where is he?
All right. We're all set. Okay.
Let's re-sedate him.
Got the needle prepped.
Here, you wanna grab this and then...
Grab the needle!
Grab the needle!
- Where did they take the girls?
- The armory.
- Where the fuck is that?
Lethal radiation poisoning detected.
You require urgent medical attention.
You idiot.
Do you realize what you've done?
You crashed an unlicensed vehicle into a suburban area.
Your orders were to keep this covert.
Do you even remember what that means?
Have you completely lost your mind?
You're useless to me.
If the administration realized what we're doing... they'd hang us both for treason.
For God's sake, Kruger, Are you listening to me?
Yes.
Yes, ma'am...
I'm listening.
I'm sorry that we crashed the vehicle and ruined someone's lawn.
But nobody is gonna hang us for treason.
We do the hanging.
Put your hand on it. Keep pressure on it.
Not so chirpy now, eh?
It's all right, boys. Elysium is about to get its first proper president.
She needs some medical attention.
I was gonna heal your daughter.
But now I will make sure that she is never healed.
Drakey, don't trust any of these politicians.
You clear out this whole building.
Thank you, boss.
I'm gonna find that little gangster and I'm gonna take what's in his head.
This place is mine now.
You wanna come to my fucking house and play?
Let's play. I'm going to annihilate that little motherfucker.
Hey!
What the hell was that?
All members of CCB, Please go to the nearest exit... and proceed calmly to ground level.
- Move, move, move!
No.
No more.
Citizen deceased.
Please exercise caution.
Illegals detected in multiple locations.
Emergency systems are now online.
Please follow indicated procedures.
Spider.
Do you read me, Spider?
Max, where are you?
The thing in my head, it can make everyone a citizen here, right?
- Yeah.
- You know how to get it out, right?
- Yes.
- You're sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Okay, listen carefully.
Armory selected.
Set.
Turn me on.
Okay.
Crowe, get rid of those two.
My pleasure, boss.
My pleasure.
Where are you, boykie?
Where are you?
How is it, girl?
- Let's play.
- No. - Come on. I'll be nice, I promise.
- No, please.
- Come on.
- Get off me. - Want me to hurt the girl?
- No. - Then come here.
- Please.
Oh, fuck!
- Is she alive?
- For now.
Stay behind me.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I have a plan.
You hear that sound?
That's the sound of me coming for you.
I will find you!
I will hunt you down!
- Okay, Frey, we have to split up.
- What?
Listen.
You're gonna go to the surface. Okay?
Take this. All right.
Find a house. Get her to a med bay.
- It won't work.
- Don't stop for anybody.
She doesn't have an ID.
It doesn't work.
It will this time. I know how to fix it.
- Surface selected.
- Go. - Come with me.
- I'm right behind you.
- No.
- I promise.
Okay. A mother and a daughter just went up in that elevator right there.
They're going to the surface, headed for a med bay.
Send one of your guys, make sure they get there, and we have our deal.
Right to a med bay, man.
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go.
- This way. Come on.
- Come on.
This way. - Hurry up, man.
Emergency lockdown initiated.
Almost there.
Pull it out!
It's just a flesh wound, boet.
That's what I'm talking about.
Fire has been detected.
All affected...
Open the door. Open the door. Areas will be shut down.
Come on, come on.
I got it.
Let's go.
Fucking door, come on.
Go. You first, come on.
Emergency lockdown initiated.
- Please stand clear of all exits.
Get up.
Get up. Come on, let's go. Stand up.
Come on. Stand up.
Stand up.
Come on. Stand up.
Hey-
You little fucker.
I'm gonna take your fucking head off.
You should definitely stand up now!
Stay there.
Fuck.
You think you can get through me?
Come on, Max!
Come on! I'm just getting started.
Come on.
Don't give up now.
Get up.
Come.
Come on, you've got more than that.
I know you. You look a little bit dizzy, eh?
Did I get you?
Are you bleeding?
You must get that looked at.
Eh, boykie?
You wanna heal that little girl?
You just need to come through me.
You've got some fire in you, boykie.
You almost had me.
We die together, boykie.
Okay. Come on, man. Let's go.
Let's go, man. Let's do it.
Okay.
Get the door!
All right.
Let's do it.
All right.
Okay, we're good.
We're good. We're good.
What?
Max?
It's okay.
There's no coming back from this.
No med bay can heal you.
All right. Give it to me.
Take it.
Okay.
You just have to press that button.
Frey.
Max?
Max, where are you?
I'm gonna have to break my promise.
I can't make it back up there.
You remember what I said when we were kids?
Yes.
- I'll take us there one day.
- Really? Yeah, I promise.
You wouldn't believe what I'm looking at now.
Tell Matilda I really liked her story.
I figured out why the hippo did it.
Come on.
You first.
Come on. Everyone has one special thing, Max.
One thing that they are destined to do.
One thing they were born for.
- Neutralize him. - Fuck you!
Let go of me.
Come on.
Hey, Chiquita.
Stand down, officers.
Arrest him!
I cannot arrest a citizen of Elysium.
- What?
- You did a great job.
Guess who Elysium belongs to now.
You see how beautiful it looks to us from here?
Now look how beautiful we look from there.
This is yours now.
To never forget about where you come from.
My little Max.
Ta-da! Ta-da!
Ta-da!
Ta-da!
Ta...
Ta-da!
Ta-da!
Ta-da!
Huh?
Three weeks, and we're still no closer to cracking this.
Right, bring him in!
Yes, sir.
This is the best party ever!
Yeah!
Ha!
Oh, no!
A dragon is approaching!
Fear not, for here come the gallant knights to save us.
Yay!
No, no, no.
What do you mean she's not coming?
I have a backyard full of these little girls who are counting on a visit from a fairy princess.
Hurts!
Stop it!
Listen!
I don't want a refund, I want the fairy princess, please!
Please, I'm begging you.
You know what?
I hope that you can sleep at night, you crusher of little girls' dreams!
Ooh, ooh!
When's the fairy princess coming?
Any minute now!
Yay!
Stall them!
Ooh!
Whoa!
Whoa, okay!
Okay, all right.
That's enough of the magic show.
Aw!
Wait, did you hear that?
It sounded like the twinkling sounds of magical fairy dust.
It's the fairy princess!
She's coming!
Look!
- Huh?
Oh!
- Eh?
Ow!
Ow.
It is I, Gruzinkerbell, the most magical fairy princess of all!
And I am here to wish Princess Agnes a very happy birthday!
How come you're so fat?
Because my house is made of candy, and sometimes I eat instead of facing my problems!
How come you have...
Okay, time for cake.
Yay!
Thank you, Gruzinkerbell!
You're the best fairy princess ever!
You are welcome, little girl!
I know it's really you, Gru.
I'm just pretending for the other kids.
Hey there, Gru.
Mr. Life of the Party!
Hello, Jillian.
So, I'm gonna go out on a limb here, but my friend Natalie is recently single, and...
No, no, no, get off the limb right now.
No limb.
Come on, she's a riot!
She sings karaoke, she has a lot of free time, looks aren't that important to her...
No, Jills, that is not happening.
Seriously, I'm fine.
Okay, fine, forget Natalie.
How about my cousin Linda?
No!
Oh! Oh!
I know someone whose husband just died...
I'm sorry, I did not see you there.
Or there.
Kyle?
Kyle?
Kyle, no!
Do not do your business on the petunias!
There you go.
Those are Fred's, go crazy.
Good boy!
Mr. Gru?
I didn't...
What?
Hi!
Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL.
Oh, whoops!
Sorry, you're gonna have to come with me.
Oh, sorry, I...
Freeze ray!
You know, you really should announce your weapons after you fire them, Mr. Gru.
For example...
Lipstick taser!
Oh, it works so good.
Man!
Large person.
Oh, sorry.
Get in there...
Huh?
...you big man!
Boss!
Uh?
Huh!
Whoa!
Huh?
Ah!
Whoo!
Ooh!
Oh!
Huh?
Ah.
Quack, quack!
Wow!
What?
Where?
Whoa, foot is asleep.
Ah, pins and needles!
Good afternoon, Mr. Gru.
Eh.
I apologize for our methods in getting you here.
I don't.
I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
I am not gonna lie, I enjoyed that.
Every second of it. Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.
That's enough, Agent Wilde.
Sorry, sir.
Okay, this is bogus!
I don't know who you people think you are, but...
We are the Anti-Villain League.
An ultra-secret organization dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale.
Rob a bank, we're not interested.
Kill someone, not our deal.
But you want to melt the polar ice caps, or vaporize Mount Fuji, or even steal the Moon...
Then we notice.
First of all, you got no proof that I did that.
Second, after I did do that, I put it back!
We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru.
That's why we brought you here.
I am the League's director, Silas Ramsbottom.
Bottom.
Hilarious.
Agent Wilde?
Oh, me now?
Ah.
Um, recently, an entire top-secret lab disappeared from the Arctic Circle.
Yeah, the entire lab, just...
Gone.
Where did it go?
I don't care.
Hmm.
The lab was devoted to experiments involving PX-41, a transmutation serum.
What is PX-41, you ask?
Mmm, it's pretty bad.
Look.
Ah!
Huh, you usually don't see that in bunnies.
As you can see, in the wrong hands, the PX-41 serum could be the most devastating weapon on Earth.
Fortunately, it has a very distinct chemical footprint.
And using the latest chem-tracking technology, we found traces of it in the Paradise Mall.
A mall?
And we believe that one of these shop owners is a master criminal.
And that's where you come in.
As an ex-villain, you know how a villain thinks, how a villain acts.
The plan is to set you up undercover at a shop in the mall, where hopefully...
Okay, I see where this is going, with all the Mission:
Impossible stuff, but no. No!
I'm a father now.
And a legitimate businessman.
I am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies.
"Jams and jellies"?
Oh, attitude! That's right!
So, thanks, but no thanks.
And here's a tip.
Instead of taeing people and kidnapping them, maybe you should just give them a call!
Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt.
Ramsbottom.
Oh, yeah, like that's any better.
Hello.
Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but your work as a villain was kind of amazing.
So, if you ever wanna get back to doing something awesome, give us a call.
Hey, I told you guys to get to bed.
Oh, sorry.
So, when you going on your date?
What?
Remember, Miss Jillian said she was arranging a date for you.
Yeah, well, she is a nut job, and I'm not going on any date.
Why not?
Are you scared?
Hey, did you guys see the Moon landing on TV?
Yeah, I can't believe it.
It's so cool!
Excuse me?
Lisa?
I was talking to Billy the other day.
No way!
He is so cute.
Ah. Hey, Lisa, I was wondering if you...
Ew!
Gru touched Lisa!
Gru touched Lisa!
Ew!
Lisa's got Gruties!
Scared?
Of what?
Women? No!
That's bonkers!
I just have no interest in going on a date, that's all.
Case closed.
I'm not scared.
Of women.
Or dates.
Let's go to bed.
Good night, Edith.
Good night, Margo.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold the horses.
Who are you texting?
No one.
Just my friend Avery.
Avery.
Avery?
Is that a girl's name or a boy's name?
Does it matter?
No, no, it doesn't matter unless it's a boy!
I know what makes you a boy.
Uh, ooh, you do?
Your bald head.
Oh, yes.
It's really smooth.
Sometimes I stare at it, and imagine a little chick popping out.
Peep peep peep.
Good night, Agnes.
Never get older.
Hey, oh!
Uh...
Okay, okay.
Hey, Tim, nice haircut!
Donnie, hang in there, baby!
It's almost Friday.
So, how's today's batch, Dr. Nefario?
I developed a new formula which allowed me to get every known kind of berry into one flavor of jelly.
That tastes good!
I love the flavor of that!
It's horrible, isn't it?
No, no!
Oh, we're making great progress!
Here, try some of this.
Mmm.
Ah.
Whoa.
Okay, just because everybody hates it, doesn't mean it's not good!
Listen, Gru.
There's something I've been meaning to talk to you about for some time now.
What?
What's wrong?
Um...
I miss being evil.
Sinister plots, large-scale crimes, it's what I live for.
I mean, don't you think there's more to our future than jelly?
Well, I'm also considering a line of jams.
Um, the thing is, Gru,
I've had an offer of employment elsewhere.
Dr. Nefario!
Come on, you're kidding, right?
It's a great opportunity for me.
Bigger lab, more evil, full dental.
Very well.
Let us give you the proper send-off.
Minions!
The highest honor awarded to Dr. Nefario for your years of service, the 21-fart gun salute!
Uh, I counted 22.
Farewell, my friends.
This may take a while.
Go about your business.
I miss you already!
Huh?
Huh.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Yes, it's for his own good.
Okay, we need to choose a picture.
No.
Scary.
Weird.
What is that?
Good morning, girls!
I have an announcement to make.
Hey, what celebrity do you look like?
Uh, Bruce Willis.
Mmm, no.
Humpty Dumpty!
Ooh, Gollum!
Okay, what are you doing?
We're signing you up for online dating!
Oh, okay.
What?
No, no, no.
Oh, come on. It's fun.
And it's time for you to get out there.
No!
Stop!
No one is ever getting out there!
Oh!
Okay, now for the announcement.
I have accepted a new job.
Whoa! Really?
Yes, I have been recruited by a top-secret agency to go undercover and save the world!
You're gonna be a spy?
That's right, baby!
Gru's back in the game.
With gadgets and weapons and cool cars. The whole deal.
Awesome!
Are you really gonna save the world?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Ah!
Hmm.
"Bake My Day."
Blech.
All right, here is the cupcake recipe I got off the Internet.
And don't go nuts with the sprinkles!
Whoo.
I wasn't expecting that.
Or was I?
Ooh.
You got a little...
Here, I'll get it.
Oh. It's just spreading.
All right, all right.
I got it!
Stop it!
Oh.
I'll let you get it.
Yeah, what you just saw there was a little something new I've been working on.
It's a combination of Jujitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare and krumping.
Okay, that's weird.
Why are you here?
On assignment from Silas.
I'm your new partner.
Yay!
What?
No, no "yay".
Ramsbottom didn't say anything about a partner.
Well, it seems that because of your checkered past, everyone else refused to work with you.
But not me.
I stepped up.
And I'm new, so I kind of have to do what they tell me anyway.
Walla!
Ya!
Aah!
Do you know this guy?
Yes, he's one of my minions.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should have known.
You are free to go.
Uh?
Ah!
Kampai!
Oh!
Dave...
Earth to Dave!
Huh?
You can leave now.
Oh, uh...
So, what do we got?
Who's on the list?
Fire them at me.
First suspect, Hedda Blumentoft, proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral Shop.
No, not her.
Okay, moving on...
Chuck Kinney, owner of Stuff-A-Bear.
Ooh.
I don't think so.
Hello?
Buenos días, my friends!
I am Eduardo Perez, owner of Salsa y Salsa restaurant, across the mall.
Now open for breakfast.
And you are?
Gru.
And this is Lucy.
And we are closed.
This is just going to take un momento.
I am throwing a big Cinco de Mayo party, and I am going to need 200 of your best cupcakes decorated with the Mexican flag.
It looks something like this.
What do you think?
- Ooh.
- Oh.
Look away!
You, whoo.
Anyway, I have to go.
It's all settled.
I'll pick them up next week!
Have a good day.
Come by if you get a chance, okay?
And welcome to the mall family.
El Macho.
What?
But it couldn't be.
What?
What couldn't be?
That guy looks exactly like a villain named El Macho.
From about 20 years ago.
He was ruthless!
He was dangerous.
And as the name implies, very macho.
He had a reputation for pulling off heists using only his bare hands!
But sadly, like all the greats, El Macho was gone too soon.
He died in the most macho way possible.
Riding a shark with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest into the mouth of an active volcano!
It was glorious.
Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty dead.
They never found the body. Oh, no.
All that was ever retrieved was a pile of singed chest hair.
But that face!
It has got to be El Macho!
Then what do you say you and I break into his restaurant?
Tonight?
Yes, that's good, because I am telling you, if anybody in this place has the PX-41 serum, it's him.
All right, all right, homework done, pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed.
What's the big hurry?
I just have a lot of work to do.
Work, what kind of work?
Very important business.
So, hugs, kisses.
Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah.
Whoa!
But you said you'd help me practice my part for the Mother's Day show.
Fine, fine.
Let me hear it.
Quickly.
She kisses my boo-boos, she braids my hair.
My mother is beyond compare.
We love you, mothers, everywhere.
Wow!
That was something else.
I really liked the way you smiled at the end.
Let's try this one more time, but a teensy bit less like a zombie, okay?
Okay.
She kisses my boo-boos, she braids my hair...
Perfect!
Time to go.
I don't think I should do this.
Well, what do you mean?
Why not?
I don't even have a mom.
Well, you don't need one to do the show.
I mean, you did the Veterans Day Pageant and you haven't been in combat.
This is different.
Okay, well, then maybe you can just use your imagination.
You mean I pretend I have a mom?
Yes, right?
You can do that, can't you?
Yeah!
I do that all the time.
Thanks, Gru!
Hey!
All right.
Hey, hey, no, no!
No.
Hey.
Hey, please.
Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for me, okay?
Dave, Stuart, come this way! With me!
Come on!
Come on!
Mmm-mmm!
Oh!
Mmm-hmm.
Huh?
Oca!
Oca!
Looka too!
Huh?
We're stealth ninjas.
We make no sound.
Right.
Gotcha.
Ya!
All right, El Macho.
You're going down.
Wait!
Wait.
What?
What are you doing?
I'm checking for laser beam alarm triggers.
It's a restaurant!
You never know what kind of booby traps this guy could have set.
Huh?
Come on.
There are no booby traps.
Ha!
Booby!
Oh. There's a chicken.
Are you lost, little guy?
You must be lost.
Ha!
Some guard dog.
Get it off of me!
Get it off of me!
Aah!
I got you!
I got it!
Ha!
Oh!
What is wrong with that chicken?
Hey, that polio es loco.
No?
Okay, let's go.
Are you getting anything?
No, not yet.
But, hey, maybe you can find something with these X-ray goggles.
Bah.
How are they working?
Tell me!
Tell me!
Aah!
Oof!
What's wrong?
Is something wrong?
That's an image I'll never get out of my brain.
Blech!
I knew it!
The serum is in here!
Ooh, then let's get it.
This is going to be good!
Ah.
Ah-ha!
What?
Salsa?
Aw, man.
Oh.
Somebody's going to die tonight.
Pollito!
What did they do to you?
Pollito? Can you hear me?
Who would do this to such a sweet little chicken?
What?
Who's there?
Mmm-mmm.
You coming out?
Or am I gonna go in?
Yah!
Huh?
Stop! My eyes!
Gru, call one of your munchkins!
We've been spotted!
Come get us!
Huh?
Hey!
Ah!
Over here!
Over here!
Over here.
Hold tight!
Aah!
I have you now!
Yay!
Ice cream!
Huh?
Huh?
All right, there he is.
Suspect number eight, Floyd Eaglesan.
Oh, okay.
See if you can get closer.
Go, go.
All right.
What the...
Oh, no.
That's not good.
Whoa!
Hey, uh, what?
Oh!
Hey, Gru!
Oh, girls!
What are you doing here?
Well, we thought we'd come visit you at work.
So, you're saving the world in a garbage can?
Funny.
Hey!
There you are.
Oh.
Who's this?
Lucy, these are my girls, Margo, Edith and Agnes.
Girls, Lucy.
Lucy, girls.
Hello.
Hi.
Are you single?
Oh!
Goodness.
Oh, hey! I have an idea.
Since Lucy and I have lots of work to do, why don't you girls go and explore the mall?
Bye!
Here is some money, go buy some useless mall junk.
Some headbands and...
Are you gonna marry Lucy?
Are you out of your gourd?
No!
She just works with me.
Plus, you love her.
You love her!
You love her!
You really, really love her!
And you're gonna get married!
Okay, stop.
This is a song of lies.
And I will be the flower girl!
I don't even like her. Now, go have fun!
Almost forgot.
Hugs!
Good luck saving the world.
Bye.
Bye, Gru!
Kids, right?
They're funny.
Those girls totally adore you.
I bet you're a fun dad.
Huh.
I am pretty fun.
Is that stealing?
Not if my wish was that I would get a lot of free coins.
Whoa!
Cool glasses.
Oh.
I'm Antonio.
I'm Margo.
I was just going to get a cookie.
Care to join me?
Uh, sure.
I'm Margo.
Um, I'll catch up with you guys later.
Bye!
Can I be the first to say, "Ew!"
We gotta go tell Gru!
All right, I'm going in.
If it picks up any traces of the serum, the sensor in your belt buckle will make a sound like this...
Mee-maw!
Mee-maw!
Mee-maw!
Mee-maw!
Okay! I get it.
I get it.
Welcome to Eagle Hair Club.
It's about time you showed up,
Mr. Gru.
You know my name?
When someone moves into the mall who is folically-challenged,
I make it my business to know all about them.
You are bald, and that is bad.
There you go, my sweet.
I'm getting nothing so far.
I think you need to move around.
Wow, this looks interesting.
What is it?
I take it you're an art lover?
No serum.
Yeah, not so much.
Oh, how about this impressive trinket?
I'd hardly call it a trinket, Mr. Gru.
Nothing. The International...
Yeah, I don't care.
Mee-maw!
Mee-maw!
Hold on, I'm picking up something.
Behind that wall!
Ah, and what do we have here?
These are my trial wigs.
You should take one.
No, thanks.
So, what's on the other side of the wall?
Here you are!
Look at me!
Focus!
Gru?
I promise that this wig will transform you from ugly to irresistible.
Margo has a boyfriend!
And they're going on a date!
Date?
Boyfriend?
What?
There she goes!
Oh, you're so funny.
Gross!
Look, they're in love.
Oh, no, no, no.
Do not say that.
No, no, no.
And my dream is to one day play video games for a living.
Wow.
You're so complicated.
Margo.
What is going on here?
Oh, Gru, se llama Antonio.
Me llamo Margo.
Me llama-lama ding-dong.
Who cares?
Let's go.
Whoa!
Kids eat free on Tuesdays.
Yay, Pop!
That's awesome!
So good to see you again, mi compadre! Ha! Yeah.
Oh, I see you have already met my father.
What?
Father?
Si. Look at this crazy small world we live in, eh?
Come, sit, let me get you something.
Oh, look at you.
He likes me.
Oh, oh! I'm sorry.
Pollito is usually very friendly.
He had a rough night.
Well, we really should be going.
Girls, come on.
That is a pity.
Young love is beautiful, no?
No!
You know, they're not in love.
They hardly know each other.
You are right, Cabeza de huevo.
They must get to know each other better!
Antonio, why don't you invite your girlfriend and her family to our Cinco de Mayo party?
No, no.
Si!
I'm sorry, El Macho?
Hadn't we eliminated him as a suspect after the whole salsa incident?
Yes, but there has been a new development, and I'm telling you, this is the guy.
You need to arrest him immediately.
And his deviously charming son!
I'm pretty sure that the son is involved, too.
The son, also!
You got to get the son!
I think that the son is the mastermind!
There's a look, there's a devilish look in his eyes, and I don't like it!
Yes, but I don't really see any evidence.
Evidence, schmevidence.
I go with my gut, and my gut tells me that this guy is El Macho.
Lock him up, lock up the son.
Don't forget about the son.
The kid gives me the creeps!
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
But, on the less crazy side of things,
Gru discovered traces of the serum at Eagle Hair Club!
Hmm, interesting.
Yeah!
And you know who made that happen?
Huh? This guy.
Nailed it.
Amazing, right?
No, I mean, sure. But it's not him, it is El Macho!
Mr. Gru, please!
No!
It is him, and I will prove it!
Gru, come on!
He really thinks it's El Macho.
Can you tell?
Oh.
Whoo!
Give me that!
Kevin, the Wi-Fi's out!
Kevin?
Hey, Lance, where the heck is Kevin?
All right, we need to revisit the number of vacation days you guys get.
I can't find anybody anymore.
Gru, it's Jillian!
I've got good news!
I have my friend Shannon here with me.
I was thinking you two could get some grub.
You know, tear it up, see what happens!
Open up!
La, la, la, la, la, la, la...
Agnes!
Agnes, tell Jillian I'm not here.
Gru's not here.
Are you sure?
Yes, he just told me!
Mmm-mmm!
I mean, no, he didn't just tell me.
Agnes, where is Gru?
He's putting on lipstick!
He's swatting at flies!
No!
No!
He's chopping his head off!
He's pooping?
I know you're in there, Gru!
There's no way you're getting out of this!
I have to tell you, I was so nervous about tonight.
I mean there's just so many phonies out there!
Yes, I hear you.
Oh, so, do you work out?
Well...
I mean, obviously, you don't, but would you consider it?
Huh? Physical fitness is very important to Shannon.
As you can tell, right?
Huh?
Ah.
I can tell.
Solid.
We are in the restaurant, you know.
Hi. Takeout for Lucy?
Sure, just a sec.
Your accent is so exotic.
Ah. Well, thank you very much.
I know someone who can fix that for you.
And you'll be talking normal in no time!
Whoo. Is it hot in here?
How's the food?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Are you wearing a wig?
What?
Ah!
I don't think so.
I knew it.
You're a phony.
I hate phonies!
Oh, what? No. These locks are all mine.
No, they're not!
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna rip that thing off your head, and show everyone what a bald-headed phony you are.
I don't think so, Miss Lady.
Hello?
Hello?
Are you...
Hey, Gru.
Hello, Lucy.
How are you doing?
Wow, looks like your date's out for the count.
It's like she's been shot with a mild moose tranquilizer.
Yeah, I'm winking because that's what actually happened.
Scusi, what's happening here?
She no like?
Oh, she's just, uh...
Oh, ho.
Sì, Sì. Sì.
Shall we take her home?
Oh!
Well, I think you did it.
You just officially had the worst date ever.
Huh, tell me about it.
Don't worry.
It can only get better from here, right?
But if it doesn't, you can always borrow my dart gun.
I've had to use it on one or two dates myself.
Yeah, you know, as far as dates go,
I think I'm good with just the one.
Well, good night, partner.
This was fun.
Yes.
Surprisingly, it was.
Oh, and, uh, just between you and me?
You look much better bald.
See you tomorrow.
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!
Yay!
So, I take it the date went well?
No, it was horrible.
High-five!
Bump it.
Mr. Ramsbottom?
Oh, hello.
What are you doing here?
We got him.
Got who?
Floyd Eaglesan!
Our agents located a secret room in his shop last night and discovered this.
It's empty, but we found traces of the PX-41 serum in it.
He's our man.
So, somehow, in spite of your incompetence, we solved this one.
I was framed!
You won't get away with this!
Get your mitts off of me!
I am a legitimate businessman.
Ah. All right.
So what now?
Well, now you're free to go back to your business.
Mmm. Jams and jellies.
And it looks like Agent Wilde will be transferring to our Australian branch.
Australia?
Yes.
But thank you for everything.
And by everything, of course I mean nothing.
Toodle pip and cheerio, Mr. Gru.
Hey, there.
Hey. So, we got him.
Yay.
That's great.
And now you're going to Australia?
Well, it's not definite yet.
I'm still figuring it out.
I've already been working on my accent.
Wallaby.
Didgeridoo.
Hugh Jackman.
So, um...
Pretty excited.
Great.
Well, good luck.
Thanks.
You, too.
Oh! Here. I wanted to give you this.
Your lipstick taser?
Yeah, it's just a memento.
Just, you know, from the first time we met.
Oh. Thank you, Lucy.
Agent Wilde.
Well, it looks like they need you, so...
Yeah, I better go.
Bye, Gru.
I brought you an umbrella.
Ah, thank you.
What are you doing out here?
Remember when you said that I liked Lucy?
Well, it turns out, you're right.
Really?
Yes, but...
Well, she's moving away.
I'm never going to see her again.
Is there anything I could do to help?
Aw, I don't...
I don't think so, sweetheart.
Well, is there anything you could do?
Hello, Lucy.
This is Gru.
I know up to this point our relationship has been strictly professional, and you're leaving for Australia and all, but...
Okay, here is the question.
Would you like to...
To go out on a date?
Uh, no.
Okay, that's not helping. All right, here we go. For real this time.
I can do this.
Agh! I hate you!
Ah.
Eh.
Kevin?
Mmm?
Tom?
Hello!
Kampai!
Kampai!
Huh?
Kampai!
Bah!
Whoa! This place is awesome!
Okay. Let's party, huh?
But first, let's go over the rules.
Because what is fun without the rules?
Agnes, easy on the churros.
Edith, try not to kill anyone. Hai!
Margo!
Hello, Mr. Gru.
Okay.
Gru!
There must be the standard 6 feet of space between you and boys.
Especially this boy.
Ah, you are a funny man.
There are no rules, señor.
It's Cinco de Mayo.
Come on! They're starting the dance!
Arriba!
So glad you could make it, mi compadre.
Hey, what's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing is wrong.
I'm just chilling with the guac, from my chip hat.
Gru, please.
I know that look all too well.
It is the look of a broken heart.
How did you know?
Believe me, my friend, I too have spent many nights trying to drown my sorrows in guacamole.
You?
Yes.
But we are survivors.
There's much more to us than meets the eye.
Enjoy the party.
Huh.
Ah-ha!
Ouch!
Say what?
Would you like some peanuts or pretzels?
That's a good joke.
I just did a boom boom.
I really need you to make a choice, hon.
I choose Gru.
I choose Gru!
Thank you, Gru stewardess!
You're welcome!
Aah!
You have not lost your touch, my friend.
Ah-ha!
I knew it!
You are El Macho!
That's right!
Nobody believed me!
Ho-ho!
But I knew you weren't dead!
Of course not.
I merely faked my death.
But now, it's time for me to make a spectacular return to evil.
Doctor, I think it's time we showed Gru what we're up to here.
Dr. Nefario?
Nice to see you, Gru.
Wha...?
So, this is your new job opportunity?
Absolutely.
You're gonna like this.
Sorry.
I had to borrow some of your minions, but it was for a worthy cause.
Oh!
Kevin!
No, he's not Kevin anymore.
Now he is an indestructible, mindless killing machine!
Bah!
Just watch this.
Bah!
And here's the best part!
I got an army of them!
Look, look, look!
Bah!
Soon I will unleash them on the world, and if anyone, anyone tries to stop them...
Yeow!
...their city gets eaten!
We can do it together.
Together?
Together!
I have admired your work for years, amigo.
Stealing the Moon!
Are you kidding?
We would be unstoppable!
Men like you, men like me.
We should be ruling the world!
So, are you in?
Woo-hoo!
Uh, yeah, probably.
Probably?
I mean, yes, yes!
Of course, yes.
I just have a lot going on right now.
I just need to get some things off my plate before we start taking over the world, that's all.
Excuse me?
No, forget it.
One hundred percent!
I think...
Do you hear that? I do.
That's Agnes calling me from on the surface.
Totally in!
You know what?
I am not so convinced that he is in.
Edith, Agnes, come on!
Ooh! Oops, sorry.
We need to go home now.
Where is Margo?
But I didn't get a turn!
Margo!
Come on.
We're leaving...
Hey, what's wrong?
I hate boys.
Yes.
They stink.
Uh, sorry. Honey, we got to go.
Oops! Sorry.
Ya!
Hey! Pollito, what's the matter?
Oh, hey, Eduardo!
Lucia, I apologize.
Pollito, he's usually not like this.
The same thing happened the other day with Gru, and...
Oh, well, speaking of Gru, um, have you seen him?
I really need to talk to him.
Yes.
I think he's somewhere around here.
You two are close, no?
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, "close," I wouldn't say we were close.
Why, did he say we were close?
Did he say that?
It's more what he didn't say.
For instance, he never mentioned that you were both working for the Anti-Villain League!
You're coming with me.
Hey!
Crikey!
So, Eduardo's actually El Macho?
Cool!
No, it is not cool!
Plus, I pretty much knew it was him all along, so if anyone's cool, it's me!
Gru!
Well, Dr. Nefario.
El Macho's onto you.
He knows you're working for the AVL.
And he's got your partner.
Lucy?
That's impossible.
She's on her way to Australia!
Nefario?
Sorry, gotta go!
He's got Lucy?
Not for long.
Come on, we're getting her out of there.
What was that?
I don't see anything.
Run!
My unicorn!
Agnes, no!
Come on!
Hurry!
What's the matter?
Bah!
Ooh là là.
Kevin!
Dr. Nefario!
You're back!
In the flesh.
Behold, the antidote.
Come on.
Let's finally put this horrible jelly to some good use.
Ah!
Ah!
Hey, guys, come on!
Stay focused here.
Huh?
Huh?
Uh...
Uh...
Oh.
Uh!
Curses!
Foiled again!
These guys captured me!
Uh...
No?
Bah!
Run!
Up that tree!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hello, Gru!
Hey hey! Nice work, Dr. Nefario!
I put an antidote in the jelly.
I mean, I'm happy to create an evil army to destroy the world, but nobody messes with my family.
Thank you, Doctor.
Now, let's go get the...
Hi!
You brought the girls?
Yes!
Oh.
Was that wrong?
What's happening to my minions?
Gru?
You guys, take care of the rest of the minions.
I'm going to find Lucy.
Eat jelly, you purple freaks!
Whoa!
Whoa!
It's over, El Macho.
Now, where is Lucy?
Let me show you.
Oh, hey, Gru!
Turns out you were right about the whole El Macho thing, huh?
Yay!
One push of this button, and I send that rocket straight into the same volcano where I faked my death.
Only this time, it's for real.
No!
Yam
Tallyho!
We could have ruled the world together, Gru!
But now, you're gonna die.
Oh!
Ah!
Mmm, lipstick taser!
Aw, he copied me.
I am not afraid of your jelly guns.
Oh, this ain't a jelly gun, sunshine.
Ho-oh!
Don't worry about me, Gru, I'll be fine.
I have survived lots worse than this.
Okay, that's not entirely true.
I'm actually kind of freaking out up here!
Don't worry, I will get you out of this.
I really hate that chicken.
Is there a red one?
It's usually the red one!
Gru, anytime now!
Listen, Lucy, we may not get out of this alive, so I need to ask you a question.
Uh, better make it quick.
If I had asked you out on a date, what would you have said?
Are you kidding me?
Yes!
Jump!
Lucy!
Lucy, where are you?
Oh, Lucy!
Gru!
Sorry!
I guess you need your arms to tread water, huh?
They'll be back.
Underwear...
Underwear...
Underwear...
Oh!
Can I be the first to say, "Ew!"
Underwear...
Okay.
Excuse me.
Um, hi, excuse me.
Uh, hi, everybody.
Okay.
She, um...
She kisses my boo-boos, she braids my hair.
We love you, mothers, everywhere.
And my new mom, Lucy, is beyond compare. Aww.
Aw.
To the bride and Gru!
Yeah!
Woo-hoo!
I'm so happy!
Huh?
Ha!
Bah!
Hey, Bob! Stuart!
Eh!
No?
Ah!
Bob!
Uh-oh!
Okay.
Okay.
Aah!
Mmm? Shh!
Blah.
At first, I didn't believe it either.
But the gods of Olympus are real.
And sometimes, these gods have children with humans... called half-bloods.
I'm one of them.
I'm Percy Jackson.
Son of Poseidon, God of the sea.
Seven years ago, four of these children were headed to Camp Half-Blood... the only place on Earth that is safe for our kind.
Only three of them made it.
We're almost at camp!
Look out!
Grover! Luke, help him!
Grover, are you okay?
My leg.
It's stuck.
Come on. I got you.
Keep going.
I'll hold them off.
No, Thalia.
They'll kill you.
Go, Luke.
I'll be right behind you.
Over here!
Annabeth, come on!
Stay back. Thalia, come on! No!
Thalia!
Her name was Thalia, and she gave her life to save three.
And so, as Thalia lay dying... her father Zeus found another way for her to live.
A way for all half-bloods to live.
A gift to ensure no one in Camp Half-Blood would die the same way.
The barrier, to protect them from those who lived for their death.
Let's go!
Every day, the story of Thalia's bravery inspires me.
And her tree protects my home.
But not always my head.
How nice of you to show up just to watch me win.
Everything they say about you is wrong, Clarisse.
You actually do have a sense of humor. There goes another one.
Go, Percy!
Come on, Percy!
I got 50 drachma on you!
You bet on this?
What, is that wrong?
Why do you torture yourself, Dionysus?
It was one transgression, one.
And with a naiad, for the sake of Olympus.
How was I to know that Zeus had a thing for her?
Or that he could hold a grudge for so long?
I think the fact that Zeus is immortal... means there's no limit to how long he can hold a grudge.
The Christians have a guy who can do this trick in reverse.
Now, that's a God.
Aren't you tired of getting beat, Jackson?
Clarisse!
Help! Help me!
Tereus, grab my hand!
Good luck with that.
I got you.
Thank you!
Percy!
Clarisse!
Clarisse! Clarisse!
So, what I'm wondering is, Percy... that first quest you went on, beginner's luck, wasn't it?
Clarisse, he saved Olympus.
That's more than you've ever done.
Whatever.
Even for the daughter of the God of war, that girl's a mythic bi...
Don't listen to her, Percy.
You know, it's too late.
Besides, she has a point.
Dude, what are you talking about?
You're more than a one-quest wonder.
You recovered Ares' stolen chariot.
No, actually, that was Clarisse.
Okay, what about the Fall Tournament?
You owned that sucker.
Mmm-mmm.
Clarisse? Mmm-hmm.
Okay, the Solstice Games?
The Bronze Dragon's Quest?
Thank you for trying to cheer me up.
I would lick a pair of cloven hooves... before I let you listen to Clarisse instead of us.
No offense, Grover.
None taken. Is that an offer?
Listen, it doesn't matter what Clarisse has done.
To Chiron and Mr. D, you're still the rock star.
Perry Johnson!
Actually, it's Percy Jackson, sir.
Whatever.
I have a very important task to entrust you with.
You do?
Yes, it's a critical assignment. And it's very taxing.
Can I trust you?
Of course.
Good.
You'll need this.
Sometimes these events get a little messy.
Maybe Clarisse was right.
Maybe I only stopped Luke from destroying Olympus... because I had Annabeth and Grover helping me, right?
Dad?
Poseidon?
Have you ever felt like everything you've ever done... maybe you didn't really do it?
It was all just luck or something?
No, of course not.
You're a God.
Speaking as someone who's not, it sucks.
It makes you question whether you were all that good to begin with.
Okay.
Good not talking to you.
Again.
So, he just walked right in?
He just walked straight into camp?
It seems he lumbered, actually.
I don't care if he sashayed!
What's the point of having this mystical protective barrier if any thing can just...
Could you not touch that, please?
That's a very precious Grenache.
I think the point is... since he did pass right through the barrier from Thalia's tree...
Don't say it... it means he's most likely a God-spawn.
Yeah, but the spawn of which God?
I know.
Poseidon. So, why did Mr. D summon you?
It's not good to get summoned.
I'm sure it's fine.
I'm sure you don't get summoned to the Big House without a major-league screw-up.
I didn't screw up.
I cleaned the entire coliseum. And vacuumed.
Don't let him get into your head, okay?
We have a dead camper walking. Dead camper walking, here.
Thanks.
This is friendship.
I'm just playing, just trying to have a little fun.
It's all right.
So, it's okay if I get your cabin when you get kicked out?
Seriously, don't worry.
It's just Mr. D.
I mean, if Chiron had summoned you, then".
Oh, you are so massively screwed.
Whatever it is you think I did, I didn't do it.
You've done nothing, Percy.
Exactly.
As you know, you are believed to be Poseidon's only heir.
Yeah, so?
So, it would seem that belief has been held in error.
Hold on. You're saying Percy has a brother?
Or a sister.
Holy Styx.
Another Poseidon half-blood.
Not exactly.
Technically, Tyson is not a half-blood.
Half-bloods are half-human, hence the name.
I don't get it.
If this new kid is not half-human, then what other half is he?
Nymph.
Sea nymph.
And when you cross a deity with a nymph, you get...
Don't touch.
It's a Gewurztraminer.
Hi.
Hi, Brother.
So, you're the big shot here, right?
You saved the world and stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, they put peppers in yours.
Are you gonna eat that?
Go ahead.
Is he messing with me?
I think he's hungry.
No, not him.
I meant Poseidon.
Is this supposed to be some kind of joke?
A half-brother?
A Cyclops?
Come on. I think the politically correct term is "ocularly impaired."
And a half-brother is better than nothing.
I like having a brother.
Dad was cool to bring me here.
Dad?
Dad brought you here? Uh-huh.
I was upstate, in the woods.
One day, this trident shows up over my head, and then it started moving South.
And you followed it.
You followed it here.
It glowed.
Well, somebody has got a new brother.
And I can see he's got his Daddy's eyes.
Well...
"Eye."
You should really get him some sprayable mist.
Anyway, it is kind of interesting timing, don't you think?
Maybe Poseidon decided he needed another son to, you know... represent.
Bull.
Excuse me?
Smells like bull. We got barrier action.
Hey, Chris, you coming?
No, I'm good.
That is so awesome.
It's chill.
Run!
Percy!
Come on!
We have to find its weak spot.
Does it have one?
Percy, distract it for me.
Hey!
Hey! I got this.
Bad bull.
Damn it, Jackson.
Do you have any idea how hard Colchis bulls are to come by?
Maybe next time you try to drown someone... you'll first make sure he's not a demigod who can swim.
Luke?
Turns out, you're not the only half-blood who's hard to kill.
You know, prophecy.
What prophecy?
What are you talking about?
You don't know? Huh. Add that to the long list of things your buddy Chiron hasn't shared with you.
Chiron, Mr. D, all the rest... they don't care about us.
To them, we're just kids.
A bunch of pawns meant to be pushed around, told what to do.
I'm not the only half-blood who thinks so.
Think about it.
What did I miss?
Where's Percy?
Last time I saw him, he was getting dragged by a Colchis bull.
Hey, you.
How come you aren't barbecued?
Cyclopes are fireproof.
How did the bull get through the barrier?
Oh, my gods.
Poisoned.
Is she... is the tree dead?
No, but dying.
A condition we're about to become all too familiar with.
Everybody, we're going to need a guard detail to patrol the perimeter.
It feels like she's dying all over again.
Who would do this?
Luke poisoned the tree.
Percy!
Yay, you're alive.
Yeah, I'm not the only one.
Luke let the bull in.
Without the tree's barrier... he probably figures there's enough Demi-Titans out there to get him what he wants.
And that would be what, exactly?
Our annihilation, Ms. La Rue.
Our annihilation.
How's the antidote coming?
Slowly.
I know this probably isn't the best time... but there's something I have to ask you.
What is it?
It was something Luke said about a prophecy... how I'm mentioned in it.
Do you know anything about this?
Knowledge isn't always power, Percy.
Sometimes, it's a burden.
I know that.
But like you said, I've been pretty unexceptional lately.
It's got me wondering if I'm prophecy-worthy.
They say that when the gods wish to torture us... they answer our prayers.
Necklace of Harmonia, Hercules' bow, Golden Apple of Discord.
Three millennia of gods and demigods... you'd think that someone would have come up with a cure for Thalia's tree.
Persephone did come up with Miracle-Gro.
Maybe we can try that.
That's it.
Right here.
That is not gonna cure Thalia's tree so much as get us all killed.
Me, in particular.
It's perfect.
It's exactly what we need.
I'm taking this to Mr. D.
No.
I was hoping to spare you this onus a little while longer, but go inside.
Upstairs, to the attic.
And when you come back down, we'll talk some more.
Assuming you're still sane, that is.
I am the spirit of Delphi... speaker of the prophecies of Phoebus Apollo... slayer of the mighty Python.
Approach, seeker, and ask.
I heard there was a prophecy about me.
Aye.
But before you learn the future, know first the past.
Long ago, before our time... before Olympus and the gods...
Titans ruled the world.
Led by Kronos... a force so evil, he devoured his own children.
But three of his sons escaped.
Zeus, Hades and Poseidon.
They destroyed Kronos... and banished his remains to the depths of Tartarus.
But Kronos is fated to rise again... to exact his vengeance on Olympus, and the world.
Only one half-blood child of the three eldest gods can defeat him.
This child shall be our salvation... or the 'cause of our destruction.
It all begins when two cousins grapple for a fleece... the son of the sea and the lightning thief.
Luke.
And that half-blood of the eldest gods... shall reach 20 against all odds.
"And see the world in endless sleep..."
"the evil soul, cursed blade shall reap."
"A single choice shall end his days..."
"Olympus to preserve or raze."
And that is "raze" with a as in "destroy."
I asked.
Is there any chance, any chance at all... that I might not be the guy in the prophecy?
The Oracle references a half-blood of the eldest gods.
You are the only living half-blood heir of Zeus, Hades or Poseidon.
The prophecy could refer only to you.
What if I destroy Olympus... by not being good enough to save it?
That seems to be the question, doesn't it?
Mr. D: It's absolutely out of the question.
If you could just listen to me for one moment... lam listening.
You want to go on a quest.
Oh!
It must be Thursday.
I'm serious.
I'm absolutely sure that this is gonna work. It was such a good year. The Golden Fleece can heal any living person or thing... including Thalia's tree.
We heal the tree, we restore the barrier around camp.
I'm surprised you want to go along with her on this, Mr. Undershirt.
Underwood.
Whatever.
Every satyr who has ever gone after the Fleece has died.
Right?
I mentioned that to her.
But it's a risk I'm willing to take for the good of the camp.
Look, the last I heard... the Golden Fleece was in the Sea of Monsters... what the humans call the Bermuda Triangle.
A place not only a satyr should be afraid of.
So, the answer is no. No.
I'm sorry, Annabelle.
Annabeth.
Whatever.
It's a terrible idea.
I've had a grand idea.
Unless Thalia's tree can be cured... and the protective barrier around our camp restored... then every demigod, centaur, satyr and nymph... will be killed within days, if not sooner.
Hey, you okay?
Don't worry, camp will be okay.
You have to have faith, right?
But fortunately, I have considered the matter.
And after great study...
I have determined that the only thing that has the power to save Thalia's tree... and therefore our home... is the Golden Fleece of myth...
What?
...whose touch can heal every person and every thing.
So, a quest, a mission of mercy, if you will... into uncharted and deadly waters... with nothing less at stake than our own survival.
Now, a satyr is naturally drawn, as you know, to the power of the Fleece.
And therefore, it must be a satyr who will guide a half-blood on this quest.
Thanks a lot.
Ichneutae!
Will you guide the champion?
Oh, yeah.
Good.
Great! That's great!
As to who that champion might be, our plight calls for only our finest hero.
The best of us, the strongest and the bravest.
The scion of the God of war...
Her name, he gets right.
Hey, Clarisse.
Clarisse!
What?
Oh.
Don't worry about always coming in second, Jackson.
You do get used to it.
I think, right? Obviously, I wouldn't know.
Listen, Luke is still out there.
He's involved with the Fleece somehow... and I've got a feeling that he's not done yet.
Really?
Because I've got a feeling that I don't really care.
Gosh, don't look so wounded.
Listen, there are generals, and there are foot soldiers.
And you should feel lucky that you even made it into the army at all.
Just try not to screw up anything too badly while I'm gone.
Okay?
Let's go.
"Cursed blade shall reap."
"Cursed blade shall reap."
What good is a prophecy if you can't even understand it?
I guess you don't have any answers either, Dad.
This was your sword.
This is a bad idea.
You don't even know what I was gonna say.
You were going to say that you're going after the Fleece to save the camp.
Actually, he was gonna say "we" were.
Look, I get what you're doing here.
You're worried about the one-quest wonder thing... and you want to make your bones.
But Ichneutae and Clarisse are already going after the Fleece... and it's not cool to bogart on someone else's quest.
I think this is my quest, too.
The Oracle says he wrestles Luke for the Fleece.
"Grapples." But she also said... that I'm destined to destroy Olympus, or save it.
Saving is better, obviously.
Yeah.
Let me pack a bag and make sure my health insurance is paid up.
How are we gonna get past them?
I think they're looking for threats trying to come in... not people trying to sneak out... so, I think we're cool as long as we stay quiet.
Sorry!
Shh!
We're...
We're guarding, too.
You left without me.
Tyson, where we're going, it's very dangerous.
I know.
I'm not stupid.
No, just dumb.
I want to help.
You'd do it for me.
I appreciate that... but I don't think you understand exactly how dangerous this is going to be.
I do.
The Fleece is guarded by Polyphemus.
Who?
Polyphemus.
Closest thing Cyclopes have got to someone famous.
Captured Odysseus. Lives in Circeland.
Wait, Circeland?
Built on his island.
Long story.
Point is, maybe I can talk to him.
You know, Cyclops to Cyclops.
No, you can't, because I'm not going with a Cyclops.
Then we got a problem, because I'm not going without one.
This Polyphemus is probably what killed every satyr that's gone near the Fleece.
You want me to lead you to a Cyclops? Fine.
But I'm bringing along one of my own, for protection.
No way.
No.
What do you think's gonna attract more attention... all the noise or the one eye?
Just give the guy a break, okay?
Okay, fine.
Shh! Keep it down.
This is crazy hard to come by... and I only brought it along in case of an emergency... which I guess this is an emergency, so... here.
Mist?
It makes the mystical look normal.
"Side effects may include handsomeness, headache,"
"self-esteem and low self-esteem."
And just know that if the camp wasn't in danger...
I wouldn't be wasting this on you.
Wasting what?
It's not gonna last forever.
You're gonna have to reapply it.
Extreme makeover alert. Whoop, whoop!
How do I look?
A bit like Dad, actually.
He's still a Cyclops.
Grover, where are we going?
What does your nose say?
Uh, somewhere off the coast of Florida.
South.
Over here.
Annie!
Hey!
It's the Chariot of Damnation.
Looks like a New York City cab.
Same difference.
No dollars, no credit cards. Drachmas only.
Exact...
Change...
Please.
Chop, chop! Get in the cab.
We just had this cab sanitized for your protection.
It wasn't this year, though.
Excuse me, we're trying to get to Florida.
Our kind of fare. Pricey.
Whoa!
Hey, there. This is Ganymede, cupbearer to Zeus.
And when I'm out buying wine for the lord of the skies...
I always remember to buckle up.
Maybe we should have flown commercial.
Look out!
Calm down.
If we didn't know what we were doing...
We wouldn't be licensed.
They don't have eyes.
Yeah.
I know, awful picture.
Bad hair day.
We do so have an eye.
It's around here somewhere.
The last time I saw it, you put it in the glove compartment, Anger.
Don't use that tone with my name.
It's not there this time.
Ah!
Wasp always puts it with the keys.
And it's 20/20.
So is mine!
Shouldn't the driver get the eye?
She'll be fine.
Tempest, split!
Percy!
We paid extra for that option.
The kid is right.
The driver should have the eyeball.
He's a freaking genius!
You're the one that put it in the visor.
While it's on the table, I haven't had a turn in quite some time.
Oh, no, you didn't!
Yes, I did.
Hands on the wheel at least, okay?
We're all gonna die!
Pipe down.
Didn't that prophecy say you're gonna make it till at least 20?
You know about the prophecy?
Oh, sure.
The Oracle is a friend.
We're besties. ALL: B-F-F!
Eye!
Eye!
Gross!
Get it off me!
What do you know about the prophecy?
No!
Okay, Okay.
30, 31, 75, 12.
What?
Percy, you got your answer!
All I got were numbers.
Yes.
You'll know...
When it matters.
I think we're a little short on drachmas.
What?
What do you... think we're...
running here?
A charity?
Get your cheap butts...
ALL: Out!
That was...
I know.
Awesome!
Can we go again?
We're definitely not in Florida.
I think we're in Olympus.
Hail to you, great Zeus!
Forgive our trespass on Olympus.
We're seeking transport to Florida.
Zeus?
Zeus?
Zeus?
Whoa, stop it, stop it, stop it!
This isn't Olympus, okay?
This is the Capitol building.
We're in Washington, D.C. Okay?
Oh.
It looks like Olympus.
Right down to the dudes with power who only care about themselves.
We need to find a bus station.
First we need to get some money.
Hey, there, valued half-blood account holder!
Sign up for our new Aphrodite Express credit card...
And you can...
Can I get four venti half-caf no-whip lattes?
And an extra shot of nectar.
Nectar?
If you haven't had, then you haven't lived, buddy.
Hecatonshire.
Hey. Whoa.
I see you got your hands full.
Room for cream?
Nectar.
Double shot.
I've lived.
This might be the most fun I've ever had.
Even.
Yeah, anything's gotta be better than living in the woods, right?
Living in the woods would have been fine if you were there.
Everything's better with a brother.
You know, technically, we don't have the same Mom.
So we're still brothers!
I know! How cool is that?
Arctic.
It's too sweet, don't you think?
No, nectar's never too sweet.
Get off me!
Get off me!
Grover!
Percy!
Damn!
Was that Chris Rodriguez?
HOW did they do that?
Back at camp, Luke said that there were other half-bloods who turned.
What do you mean, "turned"?
To his side.
Luke has Grover.
The Oracle was right.
Luke is going after the Fleece.
That's why he needs a satyr.
But what does Luke want with the Fleece anyway?
I don't know.
But if we're gonna get Grover back, we need to find Luke.
But we don't know where he is.
I know someone who does. Come on.
What, are we shipping ourselves overnight express to the Sea of Monsters?
You want to find Luke?
His Dad will know where he is.
Olympic Parcel Service. Come on.
Like it?
He'll love it.
I'm sorry to be the God of obviousness, but I'm with a customer.
You want an overnight shipment to Hades, that will be 250 drachmas.
Perfect.
Thank you, sweetness.
I will take care of that for you, and I'll see you next week.
Now, you.
You are here about Hermes?
His son, actually.
It's kind of important.
Yeah, I could tell the way you burst in here, all rude-like.
His son's name is Luke Castellan.
What has that wayward boy of mine gotten himself into now?
Wait, you're...
Hermes.
Little insulted you didn't recognize me.
My feelings might have even been hurt if I wasn't such a self-confident individual.
I don't know if you noticed, but I'm killing these shorts.
Sir, we're looking for Luke... because he attacked Camp Half-Blood and kidnapped our friend.
And we really need your help, and we don't have a lot of time.
That's really cute, how you finish each other's sentences.
Follow.
You like this tie?
I just bought it.
Hermés, of course.
Check it out.
State-of-the-art sorting, processing and packaging facility.
If you can box it, we can ship it at the speed of...
Well, me.
We have plans to expand next year.
We're finding we have some space issues.
So picture this, only bigger.
Don't touch that.
We're the fastest-growing Olympian industry.
It took awhile to get up and running, but Rome wasn't built in a day.
Trust me, I was there.
Excuse me, sir, we're in a bit of a hurry.
Relax, my friend.
Take it slow.
Oh, come on!
Give me a break!
Easy for you to say, Your Eminence.
Actually, Martha, it's not easy for him.
He's the God of freaking speed.
Except he's not the one whose butt is stuck to a big silver stick forever!
Hey. Guys, what did I say?
When we meet new people, protract your S's.
It's more dramatic.
Makes an impression.
Ugh!
I'm personally insulted.
Snakes don't talk like that.
It is a stereotype and it's offensive.
Bad enough some of our relatives are hanging out with Medusa... turning people to stone.
All right.
Ooh!
I love your hair.
I wish my hair would do that.
Yeah, that will happen.
Why don't you guys make yourselves useful?
Demi-Google Luke for me.
These kids are looking for him.
Why?
Do they have a death wish?
It doesn't matter.
Just...
Didn't even say "please."
Told you!
We should have taken that job with Hercules.
They're an acquired taste.
Luke. I don't know what to do about him.
I've tried reaching out, but the kid's angry.
He's resentful.
And he holds a grudge like nobody's business.
Just like his mother, come to think of it.
Yeah, he's not my biggest fan either.
If you're gonna cross paths or, Zeus forbid, swords with him... it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world to have a thing or two to help you out.
Collector's item, mint condition.
From Hercules Busts Heads, Season One.
Hercules Busts Heads?
Best TV show ever.
So, of course, cancelled.
Got this off Deity-Bay.
You twist the cap off this, you release the winds from the four corners of the Earth.
Now, you tell me that isn't cool.
Whoa!
No, not in here!
Not in here.
By the gods, George was right. You do have a death wish.
Now, you're also...
You're also gonna want one of these.
Um, thanks.
Mythical box sealer?
You wound me.
Truly, lam wounded.
I hold in my hands a Matter Eliminator. Trademark pending.
Anything you outline with this...
Not in here.
...will disappear.
Whoosh! Gone. Instant hole.
"Demi-Google Luke," he said.
Except, how am I supposed to type without fingers?
You were supposed to use the mouse!
I'm a snake.
I eat mice.
All right, thank you.
Have you found Luke?
Did he just say "thank you"?
I'm sure it was just a lapse.
Luke's on a yacht called the Andromeda.
It's passing by Chesapeake Beach as we speak.
Thank you.
You're sssso welcome.
There, you happy?
Hush.
Thank you very much.
Hey, listen...
Um...
If you see Luke... please explain to him for me... that parents, we make mistakes sometimes.
He has every right to be angry at me.
Just, please tell him not to be angry with the world.
I'm not sure if there's anything that I can say that will change him.
Try.
If it's one thing I've learned in 3000 years... it's you can't give up on family.
Thanks again.
He'll never make it.
That's lunch!
That's it.
That's Luke's yacht.
What do we do?
Swim?
But it's water.
Dad will help.
Hey, Dad.
We're trying to save Camp Half-Blood and rescue a satyr named Grover.
And we could really use your help getting to that ship out there.
Poseidon?
Dad?
It was a nice try, big guy... but don't be upset when he doesn't answer.
It's a hippocampus.
Hi, girl.
Boy.
Come here.
Sometimes, you just gotta ask.
All I've been doing is asking.
Are you coming?
Yeah.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Giddy up!
Back up!
Back up.
Thank you, friend.
Tyson.
Come on, buddy.
Have you seen it?
No, man.
Did he show it to you?
Wait until you see it.
It took him long enough to find it.
That's Chris Rodriguez, Ethan Nakamura, and Silena Beauregard.
Luke's been recruiting.
Shh!
This is a nice boat.
How are we gonna find Grover?
Luke is probably keeping him below deck somewhere.
Like, in a brig.
I don't think yachts have brigs, Percy.
Follow me.
Be careful, you guys.
He said keep your distance.
How much longer are we gonna be on this boat, anyway?
Doesn't matter, just watch it.
It's so time to go.
Hey, Percy. Percy!
Huh?
Tyson, do you have to make so much noise?
Sorry!
Chris?
Hey.
What have you done with Grover?
Grover?
Grover's the least of your worries.
Guesswho'shere.
What a surprise. If it isn't my two favorite cousins.
Three.
I'm a son of Poseidon, too.
That's funny, because Poseidon doesn't have any other half-blood sons.
I'm a Cyclops.
Mist.
You don't say.
It's been a long time.
You look good.
Where's Grover?
Grover, Grover.
Oh, Grover, yes. Right, the satyr.
He should be in the Sea of Monsters right about now.
I sent him on ahead with some friends. We're kind of on the clock.
Wait, you're not...
You're not just trying to stop us from getting the Fleece.
I need it, too.
I got something only the Fleece can revive.
And it's not a tree.
Wanna see it?
It wasn't easy to find.
I had to crawl through the depths of Tartarus itself.
And then Cleveland.
The remains of Kronos.
The original Titan, father to the Olympians.
And with the Fleece's help, destroyer of Olympus.
And the world.
You'd destroy the whole world just to get back at your Dad?
The Olympians overthrew their parents.
It's just our turn.
We met your father.
He said that he knows that he made mistakes.
He told us to tell you to not be so angry.
Really?
And he couldn't even tell me himself.
Does that sound familiar?
Take them to the brig.
Let's go.
Come on.
Thalia was your friend!
She sacrificed herself for you.
You're gonna lecture me about Thalia when you're hanging around with him?
You disappoint me the most.
I told you he had a brig.
How can you trust him?
He was probably making all that noise on purpose.
He wanted Luke to catch us.
What do you have against Tyson anyway?
He's a Cyclops.
I think the politically correct term is "ocularly impaired."
Who cares?
They're vicious and they're dangerous.
Yeah, vicious.
We have to get out of here.
How?
Just hang on to something.
All right, here we go.
Come on, come on, come on!
Um...
What's going on?
Percy's trying to kill us.
I think it's working.
You got it?
Piece of cake.
I think I'm gonna vomit. Yep. So, how does this work?
I don't know.
It's my first mythical tape gun.
Just like Hermes said...
"instant hole."
Go to the lifeboat.
Kill the engines.
That was for Grover.
Grab him!
We got him!
What are you doing?
Don't walk on my roof.
Join me, Percy.
It's what you were meant to do.
You can't escape that prophecy.
Let's show both of our fathers.
It's tempting.
Oh... That's genius. Really.
But I think I'll pass.
Not this again.
Go!
Are you staying?
I'll be right behind you.
May as well.
Jackson, enough.
You're on the losing side.
Not from where I stand.
Smart.
Goddess of wisdom's daughter, remember?
I remember.
Our allies and the satyr still have a head start on the Fleece.
We will resurrect you, Lord Kronos.
You will know vengeance.
And the Olympians who scorned us will know death.
Maybe you should reapply.
It wore off?
Yeah. Come on. Oh, no.
Do you want to steer for a while?
Thank you.
Nobody's ever trusted me with anything before.
Is that because of your lack of depth perception?
Is it because they're scared of you?
I was in the mountains one day... and some campers, Boy Scouts, showed up.
And when they saw me, they screamed.
They ran.
And I'm pretty sure I smiled.
People look at me, and they see a monster.
Sometimes, I think maybe they're right.
You're not a monster.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Easy for you to say.
What do you mean?
You never doubt yourself or think you're less than you are.
Thank you, brother.
Come here.
Open it slowly.
Slowly.
Hey, just take it slow. Slow, okay?
I wouldn't have trusted him with a normal thermos.
He seems okay.
I really don't get what your problem with him is.
Because you don't know what I know about them.
Thalia!
A Cyclops killed her.
His kind killed Thalia.
I'm sorry.
I never knew.
Well, it's not something I like talking about.
And anyway, it was a long time ago.
What is that?
It's the Sea of Monsters.
Why are we stopping?
I should have used two hands.
You think?
Are you mad at me?
No, not at you.
Tell me those aren't sharks.
Those aren't sharks.
Paddle!
Paddle!
Yeah, sharks would be better.
It's Charybdis.
Charyb-...
What?
She guards the Sea of Monsters.
Percy!
It's not working!
The Sea of Monsters might not be in Poseidon's domain.
Hold on!
Where are we?
Smells like the stomach.
Watch your step.
What is this stuff?
I don't think you want to know.
This has to be the worst way to die, ever.
Yeah, everything that disappears in the Bermuda Triangle... this is where they end up.
Oh, come on!
That sounded like Clarisse.
No, it couldn't be her.
You ridiculously stupid morons.
No, it's her.
It's her.
You idiot!
Better keep my electric grid up and running, or I'll plug your head into it!
Clarisse!
Hey!
We got swallowed up, just like you.
Nice ship.
My Dad's got tons of this stuff left over from wars throughout history.
It was either this or a Huey from Vietnam.
I figured a boat would be more practical.
What's going on?
Pretty much exactly what you think goes on inside of a stomach.
You're right.
That really is the worst way to die.
Reardon!
What in Hades is going on with my engine?
Is it ready yet?
Almost, ma'am.
They're working on it.
Wait, your crew is zombies?
They prefer "dead Confederate sailors whose lives have been given in tribute to Ares."
But "zombies" is fine.
Reardon!
Gun!
Faster!
Now!
Gun is hot, Cap'n.
Locked and loaded.
Aim it at that meat grinder.
Wait, wait.
You want to shoot that thing with this?
Do you have a better idea?
Because now would be the time.
Hey, Clarisse.
What?
Can you steer the ship?
No.
I just finished driver's ed.
Yes, of course, I can steer a ship.
Well... why don't we give her a stomach ache?
We'll escape through the gut.
It just might work if it doesn't kill us first.
You steer, I'll shoot.
All hands below deck!
Good luck, Percy.
All hands below deck.
This is not a drill!
Come on, boys. Get in there.
This is still my quest.
Do not screw this up for me, Jackson.
You should watch what you eat.
Go!
No kidding, genius.
I hope this works.
Just don't forget.
Forget what?
This is all your idea. Whoa! Come on, come on.
We did it!
I did it!
Listen up.
Full power to the screws.
Hey, are you guys all right?
And a Cannon.
We'll find Grover.
Where is Ichneutae?
Oh, now you miss Ichneutae?
We ran into Scylla, that multi-headed Hydra thing.
He said, "I got this."
Famous last words.
We've restored full power, Cap'n.
-Heading?
-Northwest.
Are you sure about that?
Yes, I'm sure about that.
Why, do you have a problem?
Yeah, you got a problem?
I think your Confederate warship is heading to West Palm Beach, Florida.
What is it?
I know this sounds insane, but it's kind of like my dyslexia.
But instead of being able to read Greek, I can see map lines.
30, 31, 75, 12.
Wait, that's the numbers from the...
From the crazy, eyeless taxi drivers.
They're coordinates.
Ha!
Waterboy figured it out.
And he called you crazy.
Actually, he called you crazy.
Hey, eye on the road.
30, 31 degrees north... 75, 12 degrees west.
That's where Polyphemus and the Fleece are.
Change course.
Southwest.
Aye.
Aye.
Sorry.
Land ho!
Polyphemus lives in an amusement park?
No, he lives on an island.
But the goddess Circe thought building an amusement park on top of it was a good idea.
It really wasn't.
What happened?
Opening day... long lines of savory half-bloods and one hungry Cyclops.
Bad for business.
I'll just turn us right around then.
Find us a place to dock.
I was afraid she was gonna say that.
I guess the Cyclops was bad for business.
Who knew?
We don't have time to search this whole place.
I don't think we have to.
"Plummet of Death"?
That's subtle.
It looks like something really big went through there.
I don't know. It doesn't really scream "Cyclops" to me.
At least there's no line.
Sweet ride.
Might need a push.
Here we go.
Tyson?
Let go of my hand.
Tyson:
Sorry.
It'sa small world after all.
It's a small world after all.
It's a small world after all.
Could you two just shut up?
Hold on!
Is everybody okay?
I thought that would be more fun.
I think I get what Grover was so worried about.
This must be the Boulder Polyphemus used to trap Odysseus... when he was returning from the Trojan War.
Yeah, that's right.
I know stuff.
Grover!
Enough!
I can't take this anymore!
It's been two days!
Calm your temper!
Calm your temper!
I haven't had a decent meal since those half-bloods you brought!
And this stupid fleece is supposed to lure satyrs!
Do you see any satyrs around here?
This hunger is making my eyesight worse.
I could just eat you.
If you weren't a Cyclops.
Grover!
Grover!
Hey!
Come here!
Percy? Hey! Why are you wearing a dress?
I'm having a really bad day!
Hey, hey, hey! Do not let that go viral!
Sorry, there's no way the other kids would believe me otherwise.
This is a disguise.
The guy's half-blind.
He thinks I'm a Cyclops chambermaid.
I'm showing mad survival skills, here.
And not a small amount of leg.
Funny.
I was trying to stay uneaten long enough to figure out how to get the Fleece off of him.
So, did you?
Do you think I'd still be dressed like this if I did?
It's a good look.
Thanks, Tyson.
Clopsies, how about I cook you something to drink... to calm your nerves?
I don't know what to do anymore.
Go!
Go!
This fleece used to lure satyrs every day. Huh? Now things are so bad, I even had to eat my own sheep.
The whole flock!
They were tender, though.
Drop me, and I promise you'll never hear the end of it.
Do you smell something?
Smells like half-bloods!
Half-bloods!
Get up, quick!
I was right!
You stay right there!
Woman, get a fire going!
That's not good!
On second thought...
I'll just eat you raw! Hey! Huh.
My name's Tyson.
How are you?
These guys are my friends... so I was hoping, maybe, we could talk.
You know, Cyclops to Cyclops.
You pissant with one eye!
Hey!
Not nice!
You're no Cyclops!
You're a traitor to your kind!
To be honest...
Huh? What?
He's my kind.
You disgust me.
Going somewhere?
I think you've got something of mine.
Annabeth! Oh! Clarisse!
Get back here, you punk!
Yo, Clopsies!
I quit!
Wait, you're a dude?
Well, that explains a lot.
Say goodbye.
Okay. Goodbye!
You deceitful little brats!
I'll tear off your flesh!
Come on!
Go, go!
Give me that fleece!
You're dead!
I'm gonna kill all of you!
Do you hear me?
Get back here!
We rocked that quest.
Yeah, we totally did.
I didn't know you guys had it in you!
Yes.
Well done.
It's nice work.
I really appreciate it.
I'll take that.
I don't think so.
Suit yourself.
You'd do it for me.
No!
Just remember... it didn't have to end this way.
This one's on you.
Down, boy!
You should consider yourselves lucky.
This has been millennia in the making.
And you all get to see it.
You used to be one of us!
And then I woke up.
Percy, if Kronos comes back, that's it.
Game over.
Percy.
I never called him "brother."
All he ever wanted was a brother... but I was too wrapped up in myself.
And now Luke has the Fleece... because I gave it to him.
I destroy Olympus, just like the Oracle said.
Forget the Oracle.
You're worried about your destiny?
Then write a new one.
You're angry at Poseidon for ignoring you?
Then show him why he shouldn't.
You're upset about Tyson?
Then make sure he didn't die for nothing.
She's right.
What?
There's no way you're getting me to repeat that.
What Annabeth is saying, Perce... is that we're with you.
Just give the word.
Why me?
I mean, who voted me leader?
Lord Kronos, he who was betrayed by his sons... hear now the words of one betrayed by his father.
I bid you... rise.
Grover!
Hands.
Try not to cut them off. I'm pretty attached to them.
I have to get to the Fleece.
So, what are we supposed to do?
Right.
I know you can breathe underwater, Jackson.
But can you breathe like this?
Hi, Brother!
What the...?
The water.
It healed me.
Son of Poseidon.
Thank you...
Brother.
He rises.
Master!
I brought you back!
My Lord!
It's Luke!
Luke Castellan!
Your great-grandson!
My favorite.
Grover!
It's the cursed blade!
"...cursed blade shall reap."
You want to know who gave me this sword?
The God that killed you with it in the first place!
My father.
Percy Jackson... your destiny was written long ago.
No!
I make my own destiny.
Half-blood!
Just in time for dinner.
Thanks, Dad.
Percy.
Annabeth!
Grover!
Annabeth!
No, no!
At least I'll be with Thalia in Elysium.
Come here. Give me the Fleece! Come on!
We make our own destinies, right?
So show me.
I have faith in you.
No, no.
Come on, show me.
Show me. Come on. Annie.
What happened?
Don't worry about it.
If anyone else wants to die tonight... at least we have this.
Hey. You're alive.
Yeah.
What you did for Percy... that was not so vicious and dangerous.
Thanks.
No.
Thank you.
You know what, Tyson?
I know a lot of campers with two eyes who couldn't do what you did.
Hey, Clarisse.
What?
Come on, big guy. We get back to camp, the nectar's on me.
Have you met the nymphs?
This was your quest.
I couldn't have done it without you.
I think you should be the one who gets to...
CHIRON: ...do the honors.
Here you go, Thalia.
Clarisse!
Clarisse! Clarisse!
Nectar?
If you haven't had... .
..you haven't lived.
You know what?
You don't need these anymore.
There, that's better.
Youseemhappy.
I'm just relieved to have that whole prophecy thing off my shoulders.
I'm not altogether sure it is, Percy.
You've done wonderfully, but you are still the only living human child... of Poseidon, Hades, or Zeus.
Besides... it's quite possible the Oracle wasn't referring to what would unfold on Polyphemus' island.
I'm just saying, a lot can happen between now and your 20th birthday.
That's not really what I meant.
What I meant was finding out you have a destiny... is a lot like finding out you have a half-brother who's a Cyclops.
It might not be as bad as you think.
Percy!
Percy!
Percy!
Annabeth was guarding the tree last night... and something happened.
Percy.
The Fleece!
What happened?
It was even more powerful than we thought.
Come on, help her.
Who are you?
Percy.
Everything's all right, it's okay.
I had the strangest dream.
Yeah?
Like I was dying.
What's your name?
I'm Thalia, daughter of Zeus.
Anotherliving child of the eldest gods.
Maybe it wasn't me.
Maybe the Oracle meant Thalia all along.
Could she be our salvation?
Or the 'cause of our destruction?
Long before the birth of light, there was darkness.
And from that darkness came the Dark Elves.
Millennia ago, the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith sought to transform our universe back into one of eternal night.
Such evil was possible through the power of the Aether, an ancient force of infinite destruction.
Malekith.
Asgard's forces are upon us.
The noble armies of Asgard, led by my father, King Bor, waged a mighty war against these creatures.
Send in the Kursed!
As the Nine Worlds converged above him,
Malekith could at last unleash the Aether.
But Asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp.
Without it, the Dark Elves fell.
With the battle all but lost,
Malekith sacrificed his own people in a desperate attempt to lay waste to Asgard's army.
Their deaths will mean our survival.
This war is far from over.
Malekith was vanquished, and the Aether was no more.
Or so we were led to believe.
Sire, the Aether.
Shall we destroy it?
If only we could.
But its power is too great.
Bury it deep.
Somewhere no one will ever find it.
Loki.
Hello, Mother.
Have I made you proud?
Please, don't make this worse.
Define "worse. "
Enough!
I will speak to the prisoner alone.
I really don't see what all the fuss is about.
Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes?
Wherever you go, there is war, ruin, and death.
I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent god.
Just like you.
We are not gods.
We are born, we live, we die.
Just as humans do.
Give or take 5,000 years.
All this because Loki desires a throne.
It is my birthright.
Your birthright was to die as a Child.
Cast out onto a frozen rock.
If I had not taken you in, you would not be here now to hate me.
If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it.
It's not that I don't love our little talks, it's just...
I don't love them.
Frigga is the only reason you're still alive, and you will never see her again.
You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.
And what of Thor?
You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains.
Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done.
He will bring order to the Nine Realms and then, yes...
He will be king.
I've got this completely under control!
Is that why everything is on fire?
You're welcome.
All yours.
Hello.
I accept your surrender.
Anyone else?
Perhaps next time we should start with the big one.
Where do we go next?
Hogun, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms.
You should stay here. Be with your people, where your heart is.
Asgard can wait.
You have my thanks.
As you have mine.
Heimdall, when you're ready.
Is Vanaheim secure?
As are Nornheim and Ria.
Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore.
You must think I'm a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily.
That was not my intent.
For the first time since Bifrost was destroyed, the Nine Realms are at peace.
They're well reminded of our strength and you have earned their respect and my gratitude.
Thank you.
Nothing out of order except your confused and distracted heart.
This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.
Human lives are fleeting, they're nothing.
You'd be better served by what lies in front of you.
I'm telling you this, not as the Allfather, but as your father.
You are ready.
The time has come for you to take the throne.
Embrace and celebrate what you've won.
Join your warriors.
Eat and drink, revel in their celebration.
At least pretend to enjoy yourself.
Another!
There was a time when you would celebrate for weeks.
I remember you celebrated the Battle of Harokin so much that you nearly started the second.
Well, the first was so much fun.
Take a drink with me.
Surely, the Allfather could have no further task for you tonight.
No, this is one I set myself.
It does not go unnoticed that you disappear each night.
There are nine realms.
The future king of Asgard must focus on more than one.
I thank you for your sword and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.
Hi.
Hi.
So, what's the story with you?
Why does there have to be a story?
You spent the first ten minutes of our date hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it.
It's either chicken, vegetarian, or fish, Jane.
I think there's a story and I'm thinking the story involves a guy.
It's complicated.
Is he still around?
No, he...
Went away.
I've been there.
The going away. It's hard, isn't it?
I was seeing a woman and she took a job in New York.
Eventually, the distance killed it.
And the fact that she kept sleeping with other dudes.
- No!
- Oh, so many.
Hi. Could we get some wine, please?
Sure, I'd love some.
Richard, this is Darcy.
What are you doing here?
Oh.
Hello.
So, I show up to work at the lab/your mom's house, fully expecting you to be moping around in your pajamas, eating ice cream and obsessing about...
You know who.
But you're not.
You're wearing lady clothes.
You even showered, didn't you?
You smell good.
Is there a point to all this?
Because there really needs to be a point to all this.
Right.
You know all that scientific equipment you don't look at anymore?
You might want to start looking at it again.
This is the reason we came all the way out here.
It's malfunctioning.
That's what I said.
That's what I did.
I thought you would do something a little more scientific.
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Yeah, it's...
It doesn't look like nothing.
It kind of looks like the readings that Erik was rambling about.
Our friend Erik kind of went banana balls.
He's not interested.
- I'm not interested. - I'm interested.
It's time for you to go now.
Okay.
Short but sweet.
She needs help.
I think I'm going to have the sea bass.
Sea bass, yeah.
Sea bass is good.
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.
Sea bass...
Sea bass.
Jane?
Maybe you should stop saying "sea bass"
and go after your friend.
This was so fun.
I'll just stay here and say "sea bass" alone.
And I hate you.
What?
I said he was cute.
Just shut up and drive.
You need to take the next left.
- Who's he?
- He's my intern.
- You have an intern?
- Oh, yeah.
Hello, Dr. Foster.
It's such a great honor to be working with you.
Right.
I have to call Erik.
Oh, take a right.
And a left.
I have totally mastered driving in London.
Hi, Erik.
It's me again.
Where are you?
I came here because you said you were onto something, and then you vanish.
I'm here at Stonehenge for what has been an interesting unfolding of events today.
The police were called to the scene shortly after 11 A.M. this morning after a seemingly harmless rambler approached the area then, decided to strip naked and effectively terrorize tourists there with scientific equipment whilst shouting that he was trying to save them.
The man, later identified as noted astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig has been called in for questioning by police.
Come on, this is exciting.
Look!
The intern is excited.
"Ian. "
Do you want the phase meter?
- No.
- Bring the phase meter.
The toaster-looking thing.
Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.
How do I change the ring-tone on this thing?
An astrophysicist with three degrees should be able to change her own ring-tone.
Why are you calling me?
I didn't want to shout.
Intern says it's this way.
- "Ian. " My name is Ian.
I am not getting stabbed in the name of science.
It's okay, we're Americans.
Is that supposed to make them like us?
Oh, they're kids.
Are you the police?
No, we're scientists.
Well, I am.
Thanks.
We just found it.
Can you show us?
That doesn't seem right.
Where'd it go?
That's...
That's incredible!
What happened?
Sometimes they come back.
Sometimes they don't.
I want to throw something!
Jane, give me your shoe.
I haven't seen readings like this since...
Since...
New Mexico?
Don't touch anything!
Give me your shoe.
Were those the car keys?
Darcy!
The Aether awakens us.
The Convergence returns.
You're late.
Merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle.
Then you're doing one of them incorrectly.
Perhaps.
How fare the stars?
Still shining.
From here, I can see nine realms and ten trillion souls.
Do you recall what I taught you of the Convergence?
Yes.
The alignment of the worlds.
It approaches, doesn't it?
The universe hasn't seen this marvel since before my watch began.
Few can sense it.
Even fewer can see it.
But while its effects can be dangerous, it is truly beautiful.
I see nothing.
Or, perhaps, that is not the beauty you seek.
How is she?
She's quite clever, your mortal.
She doesn't know it yet, but she studies the Convergence as well.
Even...
What?
I can't see her.
Jane!
Where the hell were you?
Tell me you didn't call the police.
What was I supposed to do?
- Not call the police.
- I was freaking out.
You call the cops, they call the Feds.
Next thing you know, we have S.H.I.E.L.D. crawling all over
- "Area 51-ing" the place.
- Jane.
We had a stable gravitation anomaly.
We had unimpeded access.
Our only competition was ten years old!
Jane!
You were gone for five hours.
What?
That's weird.
Typical.
Jane.
Sorry.
I just needed to make sure you were real.
It's been a very strange day.
I am.
Jane, what...
Where were you?
Where were you?
Heimdall cannot see you.
I was right here where you left me.
I was waiting, and then I was crying and then I went out looking for you.
You said you were coming back.
I know.
I know, but the Bifrost was destroyed.
The Nine Realms erupted into chaos.
Wars were raging, marauders were pillaging.
I had to put an end to the slaughter.
As excuses go, it's not terrible.
But I saw you on TV.
You were in New York!
Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world but I was wrong.
I was a fool.
But I believe that fate brought us together.
Jane, I don't know where you were, or what happened, but I do know this...
What?
I know...
You do?
Do what?
What?
Hey!
Is this you?
Uh, we're kind of in the middle of something here.
Um, I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested.
Hold that thought.
Look at you, still all muscly and everything.
How's space?
Space is fine.
Excuse me.
- Are you Jane Foster?
- Yes.
Do you know this man?
He's my intern.
My intern's intern.
This is private property and you're trespassing, the lot of you.
You'll have to come with me.
Jane.
- Jane.
- Thor?
Are you all right?
What just happened?
Place your hands on your heads.
Step back.
This woman is unwell.
She's dangerous.
So am I.
Requesting armed response officers to scene.
- Hold on to me.
- What are you doing?
Holy shit.
We have to do that again.
Hi.
Welcome to Asgard.
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.
I can barely remember a time before the light.
Our survival will be your legacy.
The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered.
I will reclaim the Aether.
I will restore our world.
And I will put an end to this poisoned universe.
What's that?
Be still.
This is not of Earth.
What is it?
We do not know.
But she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her.
That's a quantum field generator, isn't it?
It's a soul forge.
Does a soul forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another?
Yes.
Quantum field generator.
My words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely?
She is ill.
She is mortal.
Illness is their defining trait.
I brought her here because we can help her.
She does not belong here in Asgard any more than a goat belongs at a banquet table.
Did he just...
Who do you think you are?
I am Odin, King of Asgard.
Protector of the Nine Realms.
Oh.
Well, I'm...
I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.
You told your dad about me?
Something is within her, Father.
Something I have not seen before.
Her world has its healers.
They are called "doctors. " Let them deal with it.
Guards, take her back to Midgard.
No, I would not touch her.
Jane, are you all right?
Yeah.
It's impossible.
The infection...
It's defending her.
No.
It's defending itself.
Come with me.
There are relics that pre-date the universe itself.
What lies within her appears to be one of them.
The Nine Realms are not eternal.
They had a dawn as they will have a dusk.
But before that dawn the dark forces, the Dark Elves, reigned absolute and unchallenged.
"Born of eternal night the Dark Elves come to steal away the light. "
I know these stories.
Mother told them to us as children.
Their leader Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness and it was called the Aether.
While the other relics often appear as stones the Aether is fluid and everchanging.
It changes matter into dark matter.
It seeks out host bodies, drawing strength from their life-force.
Malekith sought to use the Aether's power to return the universe to one of darkness.
But, after eternities of bloodshed my father Bor finally triumphed ushering in a peace that lasted thousands of years.
What happened?
He killed them all.
Are you certain?
The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them, and yet here it is.
The Dark Elves are dead.
Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?
No.
It does not.
The worlds are nearly aligned.
You will be the last of the Kursed.
Let my life be sacrificed.
It is no less than our people did.
Or you have done.
You will become darkness.
Cursed to this existence until it consumes you.
Until then. no power our enemies possess can stop you.
I will tear down their defenses and ensure your return to a universe reborn.
Keep in line! Move it!
Odin continues to bring me new friends.
How thoughtful.
The books I sent, do they not interest you?
Is that how I am to while away eternity?
Reading?
I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.
Have you?
Does Odin share your concern?
Does Thor?
It must be so inconvenient, them asking after me day and night.
You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.
My actions?
I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life...
That I was born to be a king.
A king?
A true king admits his faults.
What of the lives you took on Earth?
A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.
- Your father...
- He's not my father!
Then am I not your mother?
You're not.
You're always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.
When you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.
Heimdall had lost sight of you.
You were no longer on Earth.
How is that possible?
I believe you were and you weren't.
The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil orbiting Midgard much the way your planets orbit the sun.
And every 5,000 years, the worlds align perfectly and we call this the Convergence.
During this time, the borders between worlds become blurred.
It's possible you found one of these points.
We are lucky that it remained open.
Once the worlds pass out of alignment then the connection is lost.
I like the way you explain things.
What's going to happen to me?
I'll find a way to save you, Jane.
- Your father said there was...
- My father doesn't know everything.
Don't let him hear you say that.
Jane Foster...
Please meet Frigga, Queen of Asgard, and my mother.
Hi.
Move!
To the dungeons!
Come on!
You might want to take the stairs to the left.
The prisons.
- Loki...
- Go.
I will look after her.
There's no pleasing some creatures.
Return to your cells, no further harm will come to you.
You have my word.
Very well, you do not have my word.
Send a squadron to the weapons vault.
Defend it at all costs.
Secure the dungeon.
- Odin.
- Frigga.
Go!
It's a skirmish.
Nothing to fear.
You've never been a very good liar.
Take her to your chambers.
I'll come for you when it's safe.
You take care.
Despite all I have survived, my queen still worries over me.
Listen to me now.
I need you to do everything I ask, no questions.
Yes, ma'am.
The throne of Asgard is destroyed!
To the king!
Frigga
Stand down, creature, and you may still survive this.
I have survived worse, woman.
Who are you?
I am Malekith.
And I would have what is mine.
You have taken something, child.
Give it back.
Witch!
Where is the Aether?
I'll never tell you.
I believe you.
No!
The universe rotates on a 5,000 year cycle and once a cycle, all the worlds align.
Imagine...
Imagine that this is our world.
Oh, thank you.
And this is another world.
Normally, they're separate.
But during the Alignment, everything is connected, all nine realms.
All nine realms are passing through each other and gravity, light, and even matter, is crashing from one world to the other.
But if this happens to us now, the result will be cataclysmic.
My gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the Convergence.
This time, the Alignment and all the other worlds would just pass us by.
It's beautiful.
It's simple.
Any questions?
Yeah.
Can I have my shoe back?
Heal. You will need your strength to reclaim the Aether.
And when you wake, we will kill them all.
Jane Foster?
You need to come with us.
We are still unable to restore the palace shields.
Our artillery cannot detect them.
Even Heimdall cannot see them.
My king, we are all but defenseless.
She's your prisoner now?
Leave us.
I do not wish to fight with you.
Nor I with you.
But I intend to pursue Malekith.
We possess the Aether.
Malekith will come to us.
Yes, and he will destroy us.
You overestimate the power of these creatures.
No, I value our people's lives.
I'll take Jane to the Dark World, and draw the enemy away from Asgard.
When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane, it will be exposed and vulnerable.
And I will destroy it and him.
If you fail, you risk this weapon falling into the hands of our enemies.
The risk is far greater if we do nothing.
His ship could be over our heads right now, we would never even know it.
If and when he comes his men will fall on 10,000 Asgardian blades.
And how many of our men shall fall on theirs?
As many as are needed!
We will fight!
Till the last Asgardian breath.
Till the last drop of Asgardian blood.
Then how are you different from Malekith?
The difference, my son, is that I will win.
Jane isn't calling me back, Erik isn't calling me back, stupid S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't calling me back.
- What's S.H.I.E.L.D?
- It's a secret.
Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.
Thor came back, he took Jane to Asgard, and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.
Something else went missing this week when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig notable for his involvement in the alien invasion of New York streaked nude across...
Darcy, you really need to look at this.
Your friend, Erik...
What was his last name again?
And began shouting at visitors to the historic site.
He was later taken into police custody for psychiatric evaluation.
Police are still refusing to confirm...
You were not at Odin's war council.
The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders.
No one is to come or to go.
We face an enemy that is invisible even to me.
What use is a guardian such as that?
Malekith will return, you know this.
I need your help.
I cannot overrule my king's wishes.
Not even for you.
I'm not asking you to.
The realms need their Allfather strong and unchallenged whether he is or not.
But he is blinded, Heimdall by hatred and by grief.
As are we all.
I see clearly enough.
The risks are too great.
Everything we do from here on is a risk.
There is no other way.
What do you require of me?
What I'm about to ask of you is treason of the highest order.
Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death.
Malekith knew the Aether was here.
He can sense its power.
If we do nothing, he will come for it again but this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.
We must move Jane off-world.
The Bifrost has been shut down and the Tesseract locked away in the vault.
There are other paths off Asgard. Ways known only to a few.
One, actually.
No.
Thor.
After all this time and now you come to visit me.
Why?
Have you come to gloat?
To mock?
Loki, enough.
No more illusions.
Now you see me, brother.
Did she suffer?
I did not come here to share our grief.
Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.
Go on.
I know you seek vengeance as much as I do.
You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you.
Vengeance and afterward, this cell.
You must be truly desperate to come to me for help.
What makes you think you can trust me?
I don't
Mother did.
But you should know that when we fought each other in the past,
I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere.
That hope no longer exists to protect you.
You betray me, and I will kill you.
When do we start?
He will betray you.
He will try.
This is so unlike you, brother.
So clandestine.
Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out?
If you keep speaking, I just might.
Fine.
As you wish.
I'm not even here.
Is this better?
It's better company at least.
Still, we could be less conspicuous.
Mmm, brother, you look ravishing.
It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form.
Very well.
Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions given that you seem to like them so much.
Oh, this is much better.
The costume is a bit much.
So tight.
But the confidence...
I can feel the righteousness surging.
Hey, do you want to have a rousing discussion about truth?
Honor?
Patriotism?
God bless Amer...
What?
You could at least furnish me with a weapon.
My dagger, something.
At last.
A little common sense.
And I thought you liked tricks.
Well, what then?
Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of Einherjar who will see you coming from miles away.
I won't be the one who comes for her.
I'm not hungry.
What the...
Good.
Let's go.
You're...
I'm Loki, you may have heard of me.
That was for New York.
I like her.
And what of the Allfather?
It is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne.
You called me here on an urgent matter.
What is it?
Treason, my lord.
Whose?
Mine.
My king!
The mortal has been taken.
Stop Thor.
By any means necessary.
I'll hold them off.
Take her.
Thank you.
Betray him, and I'll kill you.
It's good to see you, too, Sif.
Assuming you can get Loki's help and you can free this mortal what good would it do?
We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.
That, my friend, is why we won't be leaving by foot.
I will give you as much time as I can.
Thank you, my friend.
If you even think about betraying him...
You'll kill me?
Evidently, there will be a line.
I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.
I said, "How hard could it be?"
They're on the ship!
Get to the ship!
Well, whatever you're doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster.
Shut up, Loki.
You must have missed something.
No, I didn't.
I'm pressing every button on this thing.
No, don't hit it.
Just press it gently.
I'm pressing it gently, it's not working!
Get him! Get him!
- I think you missed a column.
- Shut up!
Look, why don't you let me take over?
I'm clearly the better pilot.
Is that right?
Well, out of the two of us, which one can actually fly?
Oh, dear.
Is she dead?
Jane.
I'm okay.
Not a word.
Now they're following us.
Now they're firing at us.
Yeah, thank you for the commentary, Loki, it's not at all distracting!
Well done.
You just decapitated your grandfather.
You know, this is wonderful.
This is a tremendous idea.
Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that.
Flying around the city, smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us.
It's brilliant, Thor!
It's truly brilliant!
I see your time in the dungeons has made you no less graceful, Loki.
You lied to me.
I'm impressed.
I'm glad you're pleased.
Now, do as you promised.
And take us to your secret pathway.
- Fandral.
- Right.
For Asgard.
Nothing personal, boys.
Loki...
If it were easy, everyone would do it.
- Are you mad?
- Possibly.
Ta-da!
We must strike now.
No.
Asgard is meaningless.
The Aether has found its way home.
What I could do with the power that flows through those veins.
It would consume you.
She's holding up all right.
For now.
She's strong in ways you'd never even know.
Say goodbye.
Not this day.
This day, the next, a hundred years, it's nothing.
It's a heartbeat.
You'll never be ready.
The only woman whose love you've prized will be snatched from you.
And will that satisfy you?
Satisfaction is not in my nature.
Surrender is not in mine.
- The son of Odin...
- No.
Not just of Odin.
You think you alone were loved of Mother?
You had her tricks, but I had her trust.
Trust?
Was that her last expression?
Trust?
When you let her die?
- What help were you in your cell?
- Who put me there?
Who put me there?
You know damn well!
You know damn well who!
She wouldn't want us to fight.
Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.
I wish I could trust you.
Trust my rage.
You'll have to sign for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.
What?
Oh, yeah.
My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.
One man's leather wallet, brown.
One key ring, three keys.
Prescription medicine...
Various.
- And...
- Erik.
- These.
- Yeah.
Those.
Thank goodness.
Erik.
Yes?
It's, uh, Darcy.
Darcy.
So good to see you.
Oh, I missed you, too.
How did you find me?
You were naked on TV.
Okay, time to go, lots to do.
Getting weird now.
I should not be left in charge of stuff like this.
I don't get paid enough.
I don't get paid, period.
I'm Ian by the way, uh, Darcy's intern.
Yeah, I don't get paid either.
Are you all right?
I've had a god in my brain.
Dr. Selvig, sir, your gear is beeping at me.
It's happening.
It's sooner than I calculated.
Wait.
What's happening?
Birds?
Birds are happening?
They're starlings.
It's called a murmuration.
My dad, he used to take me bird watching as a kid.
- Nerd.
- Look!
Where did they go?
What the hell was that?
Why are you smiling?
There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are.
Take me to Jane's lab.
Jane.
Malekith.
All right.
Are you ready?
I am.
You know, this plan of yours is going to get us killed.
Yes, possibly.
You still don't trust me, brother?
Would you?
No, I wouldn't.
Thor!
No!
You really think I cared about Frigga?
About any of you?
All I ever wanted was you and Odin dead at my feet!
Malekith!
I am Loki of Jotunheim, and I bring you a gift.
I ask only one thing in return...
A good seat from which to watch Asgard burn.
He is an enemy of Asgard.
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.
Look at me.
Loki!
Now!
- Ah! - No!
See you in hell, monster.
No.
No, no, no.
Oh, you fool, you didn't listen.
I know...
I'm a fool, I'm a fool.
Stay with me, okay?
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. - Shh...
It's okay.
It's all right.
I'll tell Father what you did here today.
I didn't do it for him.
No!
He's going to unleash it.
Not just on Asgard, or on a star.
Malekith is going to destroy everything.
How?
Jane, how?
I saw him on Earth.
Why would he go to Earth?
The Convergence.
Oh, God.
None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.
Then Malekith would've only possessed it that much sooner.
I only found it because I was looking for you.
Jane...
Now we're trapped here.
It's not me.
Hello?
Hi, Jane, it's Richard.
Richard?
Where are you?
I'm still at the office.
It's been a crazy day here today.
- Oh, my God, this is amazing.
- Is it?
I quite enjoyed our lunch despite never actually ordering anything.
How am I getting service here?
Is this a bad time?
Do you want me to try you later?
No, no, no.
Please, whatever you do, do not hang up the phone.
Okay, then.
I was just wondering if you want to try again.
Uh, maybe dinner next time.
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Just stay on the phone, okay?
- Yeah, I will.
Oh, my God.
Am I interrupting something?
No, no, no.
Nothing at all.
Come on.
I'm losing you there.
Are you in a tunnel?
Where are we going?
Hello?
Why are there so many shoes in here?
I'll just text her.
So, who's Richard?
Really?
- Jane!
- Hey.
You can't just leave like that.
The whole world is going crazy.
All the stuff we saw is spreading.
- Did you go to a party?
- Erik?
Jane!
How wonderful.
- You've been to Asgard.
- Where are your pants?
Oh, he, uh...
He says it helps him think.
Okay, well, I'm going to need everything you got on this. All the work you've been doing on gravimetric anomalies, everything.
Okay.
Are you well, Erik?
Your brother's not coming, is he?
Loki is dead.
Oh, thank God!
I...
I meant, I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
Forgive me, my liege.
I've returned from the Dark World with news.
Thor?
There was no sign of Thor, or the weapon, but...
What?
We found a body.
Loki.
Malekith is going to fire the Aether at a spot where all the nine worlds are connecting.
Amplifying the weapon's impact.
For each additional world, the power will increase exponentially.
The effect would be universal.
But the Alignment is only temporary.
He must be in exactly the right place at the right time.
Well, how do we know where that is?
We follow the directions.
This has happened before thousands of years ago, and the Ancients were there to see it.
All the great constructions, the Mayans, the Chinese, the Egyptians.
They made use of the gravitational effects of the Convergence.
And they left us a map.
Stonehenge,
Snowdon, the Great Orme.
These are all coordinates taking us...
Here.
Greenwich?
The walls between worlds will be almost non-existent.
Physics is going to go ballistic.
Increases and decreases in gravity, spatial extrusions.
The very fabric of reality is going to be torn apart.
I better get my pants.
Focus!
This is important.
We have to hammer them in all around the site and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.
They're taped together.
Do you even know what these things do?
Uh... No.
Neither do I.
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Right.
Holy...
Shit.
You needn't have come so far, Asgardian.
Death would've come to you soon enough.
Not by your hand.
Your universe was never meant to be.
Your world and your family will be extinguished!
We're running out of time.
- Almost there.
- Are you sure this is going to work?
These devices were made to detect anomalies, not cause them.
Oh, come on.
Come on, Darcy.
You know, with all that power, I thought you'd hit harder.
Done.
The Convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes.
That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for eight.
Okay, you might want to hold on to something.
That is awesome!
How did you do that?
Well, the gravitational fields interact with the weak spots between worlds, creating...
Ooh, get the guy with the sword!
What the hell just happened?
Move!
What are you all doing?
You need to get out of here, now!
You're joking, right?
That's Thor out there.
He's waving his hammer around and everything!
Confirming ship is hostile.
Confirmed, ship is hostile.
You have permission to engage.
Roger.
Missiles locked.
Missiles away.
Missiles off target.
I repeat, target missed.
I'm losing control.
Mayday! Mayday! Lost positive control.
What are you doing?
My signal's not connecting.
Jane!
Come on.
Are you all right?
You saved my life.
Yeah.
I guess I did.
Darcy?
Jane!
- Ian!
- Selvig!
Mew mew!
How do I get to Greenwich?
Take this train.
Three stops.
Sorry. Sorry.
- We're out of time.
- Jane.
Jane!
Thor!
We're too late.
The Convergence is at its peak.
Can those things stop him?
Not from here.
We can't get close enough.
I can.
Malekith!
Darkness returns, Asgardian.
Have you come to witness the end of your universe?
I've come to accept your surrender.
You think you can stop this?
The Aether cannot be destroyed.
But you can.
Thor!
No.
Jane!
Everybody okay?
He's gonna come back.
Except, you know, last time he was gone for, like, two years.
Well, it's only been two days, so...
Did he say anything before he left?
Yeah, he had to figure some stuff out with his father.
He kinda committed treason...
On our way out.
You once said there would never be a wiser king than me.
You were wrong.
The Alignment has brought all the realms together.
Every one of them saw you offer your life to save them.
What can Asgard offer its new king in return?
My life.
Father, I cannot be king of Asgard.
I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath, but I cannot do so from that chair.
Loki, for all his grave imbalance, understood rule as I know I never will.
The brutality, the sacrifice...
It changes you.
I'd rather be a good man than a great king.
Is this my son I hear, or the woman he loves?
When you speak, do I never hear Mother's voice?
This is not for Jane, Father.
She does not know what I came here to say.
Now, forbid me to see her, or say she can rule at my side.
It changes nothing.
One son who wanted the throne too much, another who will not take it.
Is this my legacy?
Loki died with honor.
I shall try to live the same.
Is that not legacy enough?
It belongs to you.
If you are worthy of it.
I shall try to be.
I cannot give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.
I know.
If I were proud of the man my son had become, even that, I could not say.
It would speak only from my heart.
Go, my son.
Thank you, Father.
No.
Thank you.
I present to you,
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.
Asgardians, it's an honor.
You know why we're here.
Of course.
But, if I may ask, why not keep it secure in your own vault?
The Tesseract is already on Asgard.
It is not wise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.
That's very wise.
I can assure you, it will be absolutely safe here,
in my collection.
See that it is.
One down.
Five to go.
All right now.
Y'all fresh niggers.
Y'all gonna be in a cutting gang.
Very simple.
I want you to take your knife.
Get in them cane.
Make it sing.
Take the cane out.
Cut my tops.
Clean the shucks off.
Throw it on a pile for the planting gang.
Now, them cane ain't gonna jump up and bite you.
Don't shy back.
Rush here, boys!
Rush here!
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Into bed.
Into bed.
Thank you for the music.
Come on. Ouch.
Get in there. Come on.
Give me a kiss.
I love you, Margaret.
I love you, too.
Sleep well.
I'll take this.
I don't want to hear any more noise.
Three weeks and two days.
It is the custom.
I wonder what you will do without me.
I won't stay idle.
Darling, it's good money.
If only I didn't have to share your cooking with other people.
You don't.
Be good for your mother.
Okay, Alonzo?
Can I get a kiss, please?
Thank you.
Travel safely.
Stay safely.
Ready?
Devil call his name, there he is now.
Mr. Northup!
I have two gentlemen whose acquaintance you should make.
Misters Brown and Hamilton.
Sir.
Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen... were inquiring about distinguished individuals... and I was just this very moment... saying Solomon Northup is an expert player on the violin.
He was indeed.
Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.
Well, taking into consideration his graciousness and your modesty... may we trouble you for a moment of your time to converse, sir?
Of course.
Good day.
A circus?
That is our usual employee.
The company currently in the city of Washington.
Circus is too constricting a word... to describe the talented and merry band with which we travel.
It is a spectacle unlike most have ever witnessed.
Creatures from the darkest Africa as yet unseen by civilized man.
Acrobats from the Orient... who contort themselves in the most confounding manners.
And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown... an internationally renowned practitioner in the art of prestidigitation.
We are on our way thither to rejoin the company having left for a short time... to make a small profit from our own exhibitions.
The reason for our inquiry with Mr. Moon...
Yes.
We had just a devil of a time in procuring music for our entertainments.
Men of true talents are seemingly in short supply.
Thank you, sir.
If we could persuade you to accompany us as far as Washington-
We could give you one dollar for each day's services... and three dollars for every night played at our performances.
In addition, we would provide sufficient pay... for your return here to Saratoga, two weeks from today.
Welcome to Washington, Solomon.
Hamilton, you know too much.
Some say not enough.
Solomon, 43 dollars.
All to you.
That is far more than my wages amount to.
It's been a most profitable week, sir.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Another.
Gentlemen, your generosity is extraordinary.
And your talents are undeniable.
Mmm. To Solomon.
Cheers.
Ugh!
It's all right, Solomon.
There's no shame in it.
No shame at all.
Hamilton, we must hurry.
One too many libation.
We're halfway there.
So sorry...
We won't hear it.
We won't.
Let him sleep, Hamilton.
Mmm. A good night's rest.
And tomorrow... tomorrow you will feel as well and refreshed as if the earth were new again.
Hamilton, there's nothing more we can do for him.
Such is the pity.
Well, boy, how do you feel now?
My name...
My name is Solomon Northup.
I'm a free man.
A resident of Saratoga, New York.
The residence of my wife and children who are equally free.
And you have no right whatsoever to detain me.
You're not any free man.
And I promise you...
I promise you upon my liberation
I will have satisfaction for this wrong.
Resolve this.
Produce your papers.
You're no free man.
And you ain't from Saratoga.
You're from Georgia.
You ain't a free man.
You're nothing but a Georgia runaway.
You're just a runaway nigger... from Georgia.
You're a slave!
You're a Georgia slave!
Are you a slave?
No.
Help.
Help me.
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Help!
That old thing of yours is just rags and tatters.
You need something proper to wear.
Go on, put it on.
There.
That's fine.
That's fine.
Got no gratitude?
No.
That's from my wife.
Rags and tatters.
Rags and tatters.
Go on, wash up.
The boy, too.
Get him clean.
Scrub now.
Do you know when my mama will come?
Hush him up!
Mama!
Mama!
Quiet.
Quiet, please.
Mama!
Hush him up!
Your mother will come, I swear she will.
But you must be silent.
Be silent.
We need a sympathetic ear.
An opportunity to explain our situation.
Who, in your estimation, is that sympathetic ear?
The two men I journeyed with.
I'm certain they're making enquiries at this very moment.
I'd be just as certain they're counting the money paid for delivering you to this place.
They were not kidnappers, they were artists.
Fellow performers.
You know that?
You know for certain who they were?
The reality to come is us being transported southward.
New Orleans, if I was to venture.
After we arrive, we'll be put to market.
And beyond that...
Well, I suppose once in a slave state, there's only one outcome.
No.
I don't say that to give you empty agitation, John.
For y'all, there ain't nothing but that.
But John wasn't kidnapped.
John's just being held as debt, that's all.
Master pay his debt and John be redeemed.
Boy, our masters will not come for us.
John is sorry for y'all, but that's how it be.
Where you're going, you're going without John.
Mama!
Randall!
Mama!
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Thank you, God.
Come on.
Get up.
- I said, get up!
- No, don't...
I don't want to hear you talk!
Get in the yard.
Not my children!
Ain't no need for all that.
Just taking a little trip, that's all.
Don't want to frighten the children over a little boat ride, do you?
John's master gonna pay his debt.
Line up!
His master gonna pay his debt!
I don't want to hear a word out of none of you!
Not a one.
All right, come on.
Move.
Come on.
Come on, child.
Come on.
Follow your mama.
Come on, boy.
Up these stairs.
Get down out of that wagon.
Come on.
Come on. Move it!
Let's go!
Up, up, up the stairs.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, move it!
All right, come on.
Hey, you. Get up.
Sit down, right there.
Come on.
Right there. Just sit down.
Cheer up and don't be so cast down.
If you want to survive, do and say as little as possible.
Tell no one who you really are and tell no one you can read and write.
Unless you want to be a dead nigger.
Now keep your mouth shut.
I say we fight.
The crew is fairly small.
Were it well planned, I believe they could be strong-armed.
Three can't go against the whole crew.
The rest here are niggers.
Born and bred slaves.
Niggers ain't got no stomach for a fight.
Not a damn one.
All's I know, if we get where we're traveling... we'll wish we'd died trying.
Survival's not about certain death, it's about keeping your head down.
Days ago, I was with my family... in my home.
Now you tell me all is lost.
"Tell no one who I am." That's the way to survive?
Well, I don't want to survive.
I want to live.
Better off.
Better than us.
I don't see him.
Clemens!
Clemens Ray!
Master.
Clemens!
Master Ray, sir!
Master Ray!
Who's in charge here?
I'm the captain!
I'm Mr. Jonus Ray.
My solicitor has documentation... verifying the negro known as Clemens Ray is my property.
I know nothing of this arrangement.
You are ordered to return that property immediately or be charged with thievery.
Free him!
Master.
Master Ray, sir.
Clemens!
- Clemens!
- Get him back!
Clemens!
Clemens!
Clemens!
Mr. Parker.
Ah, Mr. Northup.
Mrs. Northup.
Solomon, could I interest you in a new cravat?
Pure silk, by way of the French.
We're in need of a fresh carryall for my Mrs.'s travels.
Nothing more.
The year has passed already.
Off to work at Sandy Hill again?
I am.
I have just the thing.
Something to suit your style... and yet sturdy enough for the 40-mile round trip.
It's beautiful.
At what price?
We will take it.
Children, come see what you father has just purchased for me.
One moment, sir, and you'll be assisted.
Mr. Parker.
Sir?
If we could discuss the price.
Oh, forgive me, Solomon.
Forgive me, Mrs. Northup.
A customer waits.
Welcome, sir.
Shop well, sir, but mind your wallet.
Pay no attention to this gentleman's nonsense.
Jasper!
My regrets for the intrusion, sir.
No intrusion.
Good day, sir.
Good day.
Jasper, out.
Very good. Very good.
Let's see, here.
Eliza!
Stand up when you hear your name.
Eliza.
Lethe!
John.
Oren.
Platt.
Stand up.
You fit the description given.
Why didn't you answer when called?
My name is not Platt.
My name...
Your name is Platt.
Captain, get these niggers to my cart.
Mmm.
Move.
I believe I have something very much to your liking in the back room.
Follow me, please.
Now, inspect them at your leisure... but I ask you to pay particular regard to young Ezra here.
Incredibly sound limbs.
I have never seen anything quite like him.
And this marvelous creature.
Can you believe it?
Mmm?
She'll make a fine lady's maid.
Madam?
So, inspect at your leisure.
Take your time.
Help yourself to refreshments.
Gentlemen, what catches your fancy here?
Hmm?
This boy?
Yes?
Open your mouth.
Open wider.
Look in there. Never been sick a day in his life.
And I call particular attention to Martha.
She is an excellent pastry cook.
Ah, Mr. Ford.
Splendid seeing you, sir.
What catches your fancy?
This lad?
He's very brawny.
How much for the ones Platt and Eliza?
Ah, yes.
A thousand for Platt.
Uh... Oh.
This is a nigger of considerable talent, I assure you.
700 for Eliza.
My fairest price.
Mmm.
You will accept a note?
Please, sir.
Do not divide my family.
Do not take me unless you take my children.
Eliza!
Quiet!
You will have the most faithful slave in me.
The most faithful slave that has ever lived.
But I beg that you do not separate us.
Your price for the boy?
Eliza!
Stop it!
I will give you something to cry about.
Randall, come forward.
Come, come, come.
Now, do you see how fit this boy is?
Like ripe fruit.
May I take your stick a moment?
Observe this.
Randall, jump, jump, jump.
Run, run, run.
Very good!
Higher.
Now, you see this.
It's very likely he will grow into a fine beast.
600 for the boy.
Fair and final.
Done.
Superb.
A moment, please.
Mr. Ford.
Please.
Eliza!
How much for the little girl?
Ah...
You have no use for her.
One so young will bring you no profit.
No, no, no.
I cannot sell the girl.
No, there's heaps and piles of money to be made from her.
She's a beauty.
One of the regular bloods.
None of your thick-lipped, bullet-heated, cotton-picking niggers, here.
Her child, man.
Please.
For God's sake, are you not sentimental in the least?
My sentimentality extends the length of a coin.
God, please.
Now do you take this lot, Mr. Ford, or do you pass on them?
Please, please. Please.
I will take the ones Platt and Eliza.
Sold, Eliza and Platt.
I will not go without my children!
Goddamn sniveling wench!
You will not take them from me!
God damn you! Get her out of here, Cape!
Please! No! No!
Get her out of here, god damn it!
Platt, get your fiddle.
Play, play, play something.
I will give you something to cry about, you goddamned witch!
Get her out of here, Cape!
Out, now!
Mama!
Mama!
Mama!
Yes.
Mr. Ford, a pleasure.
Did you bring all those niggers?
Two of them?
You got two?
Mr. Chapin.
This one's crying.
Why is this one crying?
Separated from her children.
Oh, clear.
It couldn't be helped.
Poor, poor woman.
Mr. Chapin.
Yes, sir.
Tomorrow, you have to take these two up to the mill and start them working.
For now, make them adequate.
Fix them a meal and have them rest themselves.
Yes, sir.
Come on, now.
Come on!
Don't dawdle!
Something to eat, and some rest.
Your children will soon be forgotten.
For all of you raw niggers that don't know... my name is John Tibeats, William Ford's chief carpenter.
You will refer to me as "Master."
Mr. Chapin is the overseer on this plantation.
You, too, will refer to him as "Master."
So, clap your hands.
Like this.
Come on.
Come on, now. Clap your hands.
Nigger run Nigger flew Nigger tore his shirt in two Run, run The pattyroller will get you
That's right.
Like you mean it.
Nigger run Run so fast
"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac..."
"and the God of Jacob."
"And when the multitude heard this,"
"they were astonished at his doctrine."
"And then one of them, which was a lawyer..."
"asked him a question, tempting him."
The creek is plenty deep enough to sail.
Even with a boat full of load.
The distance from the work area to the point on the latter bayou... is several miles by water fewer than land.
It occurs to me that the expense of transportation would be materially diminished...
"Materially diminished"?
...if we use the waterway.
Are you an engineer, or a nigger?
Are you an engineer, or a nigger?
Let the man say his piece.
It's a scheme.
Plenty of engineers have schemed similarly.
The passes are too tight.
I reckon them at more than 12 feet at their most narrow.
Wide enough for a tub to traverse if a team of niggers cleared it out.
And you know what of transport and terraforming?
I labored repairing the Champlain canal... on the section over which William van Nortwick was superintendent.
With my earnings, I hired several efficient hands to assist me... and entered into contracts for the transportation of large rafts of timber... from Lake Champlain to Troy.
Well, I'll admit to being impressed even if you won't.
Collect a team.
See what good you can do.
You good?
Clear it out!
Two, three...
Too late for me
I live or die
Lay down and cry
Hey, boy I'm tired
My lord Sometimes
I'm strong Yes, sir
I'm tall Yes, sir
Platt, you are a marvel.
What took you so long?
Thank you, Master Ford.
Platt.
My great thanks, Master Ford.
No, my thanks to you.
And it is the least of it.
I hope it brings us both much joy over the years.
God!
Eliza.
Eliza.
Stop!
Stop your wailing!
If you let yourself be overcome by sorrow, you will drown in it.
Have you stopped crying for your children?
You make no sounds, but will you ever let them go in your heart?
They are as my flesh.
Then who is distressed?
Do I upset the master and the mistress?
Do you care less about my loss than their well-being?
Master Ford is a decent man.
He is a slaver!
Under the circumstances.
Under the circumstances, he is a slaver.
But you truckle at his boot.
You luxuriate in his favor.
I survive!
I will not fall into despair!
I will offer up my talents to Master Ford!
I will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportune!
Ford is your opportunity?
You think he does not know that you are more than you suggest?
But he does nothing for you.
Nothing.
You are no better than prized livestock.
Call for him.
Call!
Tell him of your previous circumstances, and see what it earns you, Solomon.
So, you've settled into your role as Platt, then?
My back is thick with scars... for protesting my freedom.
Do not accuse me.
I accuse you of nothing.
I cannot accuse.
I have done dishonorable things to survive... and for all of them, I have ended up here.
No better than if I stood up for myself.
God, forgive me.
Solomon, let me weep for my children!
"Whosoever, therefore, shall humble"
"himself as this little child..."
"the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
"And who so shall receive one such little child in my name..."
I cannot have that kind of depression about.
"But who so shall offend one of these little ones..."
"it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck..."
"and he were drowned in the depth of the sea."
Amen.
Amen.
Make them boards flush.
They are, sir.
No, they is no such thing.
They are as smooth to the touch as a yearling's coat.
Are you calling me a liar, boy?
It's all a matter of perspective, sir.
From where you stand, you may see differently, but the hands are not mistaken.
I simply ask that you use all your senses before rendering judgment.
Oh, my, you are a brute.
You are a dog.
And no better for following instruction!
I do as ordered.
Then you'll be up at daybreak.
You will procure a keg of nails from Chapin... and commence to putting on clapboards.
Yes, sir.
Make them boards flush.
No, please!
Please, Sam!
Where am I going?
Where am I going, Sam?
Solomon!
Solomon!
Solomon!
Solomon!
Solomon!
When I say I had my Master's favor, you understand.
And for nine years... he blessed me with every comfort and luxury in life.
Silks and jewels... and even servants to wait upon us.
Such was our life.
And the life of this beautiful girl I bore for him.
But Master Berry's daughter... she always looked at me with an unkind nature.
And she hated Emily, no matter she and Emily were flesh of flesh.
As Master Berry's health failed, she gained power of the household... and eventually, I was brought to the city under the false pretense... of our free papers being executed.
My poor children.
I thought I told you to commence to putting on clapboards.
Yes, Master, I'm about it.
These have all been replaced.
And didn't I tell you to get a keg of nails?
And so, I did.
So, you did.
God damn you.
I thought you knowed something!
I did as instructed.
If there's something wrong, it's wrong with the instruction.
You black bastard.
You goddamn black bastard.
Strip your clothes.
Strip.
I will not.
You will not live to see another day, nigger!
Help!
Murder!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
What is the matter?
What is the matter?
Master Tibeats wants to whip me for using the nails you gave me.
This ain't done by half.
I will have flesh.
And I will have all of it!
Do not stir.
Do not leave the plantation.
For, if you run, I cannot protect you.
Stay here.
Gentlemen, whoever moves that nigger is a dead man.
I am the overseer on this plantation.
William Ford holds the mortgage on Platt.
If you hang him, he will lose his debt.
You have no claim to his life.
As for you two... if you have any regard for your own safety...
I say, be gone!
You got no cause!
Platt is mine, and mine to do with as I please!
If you touch...
Sam!
Fetch the mule.
Get Master Ford.
Platt.
Poor Platt.
I believe Tibeats is skulking about the premises somewhere.
He wants you dead, and he will have it so.
It's no longer safe for you here.
And I don't believe you will remain passive if Tibeats attacks.
I have transferred my debt to Edwin Epps.
He will take charge...
Master Ford.
You must know that I'm not a slave.
I cannot hear that.
Before I came to you, I was a freeman.
I'm trying to save your life!
And I have a debt to be mindful of.
And that is to Edwin Epps now.
And he is a hard man.
Prides himself on being a nigger breaker.
But truthfully, I could find no others who would take you.
You've made a reputation of yourself.
Whatever the circumstances, you are an exceptional nigger, Platt.
But I fear no good will come of it.
"And that servant..."
"which knew his lord's will..."
Which knew his lord's will.
"...and prepared not himself..."
Prepared not himself.
"...neither did according to his will..."
"shall be beaten with many stripes."
Do you hear that?
"Stripes."
That nigger that don't obey his lord...
That's his master, do you see?
That there nigger shall be beaten with many stripes.
Now, "many" signifies a great many.
40, 100, 150 lashes.
That's scripture.
Pick that cotton.
Move along, now.
Come on, Edward!
Drive them niggers!
Pick that cotton!
Move along, now.
What are you doing, boy?
Come on!
240 for Bob.
What you got for James?
295 pounds.
That's real good, boy.
That's real good.
182 for Platt.
How much can even an average nigger pick a day?
200 pounds.
This nigger ain't even average.
512 pounds for Patsey.
512!
You menfolk got no shame letting Patsey out-pick you.
The day ain't yet come she swung lower than 500 pounds.
Queen of the fields, she is.
138 pounds...
I ain't done, Treach.
Ain't I owed a minute to luxuriate on the work Patsey done?
Yes, sir.
Damn queen.
Born and bred to the field.
A nigger among niggers.
And God gave her to me.
A lesson in the rewards of righteous living.
All be observant to that.
All!
Now, Treach. Now speak.
138 pounds for Phebe.
Hit 145 yesterday.
Pull her out.
206 pounds for George.
How much he pick yesterday?
229.
Get him out.
Come on, get.
Come on.
Come on, boy, move!
Get up!
We dance tonight!
Get up!
Get your fiddle, Platt.
Get up!
Come on!
Get, get, get!
Come on, Platt.
Come on!
Come on, where's your merriment?
Move your feet!
Sell her.
What's all this?
You will sell the negress.
Sell little Pats?
She pick with more vigor than any other nigger.
Choose another to go.
No other.
Sell her.
I will not.
You will remove that black bitch from this property... or I'll take myself back to Cheneyville.
Back to that hog's trough where I found you?
Do not set yourself up against Patsey, my dear.
Because I will rid myself of you well before I do away with her.
What you looking at?
Damn woman.
I won't have my mood spoiled.
I will not.
Dance.
Dance, I says!
Come on!
Pick it up, Platt.
Play that fiddle, boy.
Platt.
Yes, Mistress?
Can you find your way to Bartholomew's?
I can, ma'am.
This is a list of goods and sundries.
You will take it to be filled and return immediately.
Take your tag.
Tell Bartholomew to add it to our debt.
Yes, Mistress.
Where you from, Platt?
I told you.
Tell me again.
Washington.
Who were your master?
Master name a Freeman.
Was he a learned man?
I suppose so.
He learn you to read?
A word, here or there.
But I have no understanding of the written...
Don't trouble yourself with it.
Same as the rest.
Master brought you here to work, that's all.
Any more will earn you 100 lashes.
Come here, boy.
Come on.
Where you going, boy?
On my way to Bartholomew's.
Sent by Mistress Epps.
You best get there, then.
Get there quick.
Any trouble?
No, ma'am.
No trouble.
Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.
Good morning, Master Shaw.
Master sent me to retrieve Patsey.
May I approach?
You may.
Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.
Nigger Platt.
Patsey, Master wishes you to return.
The Sabbath day, I is free to roam.
Master sent me running to fetch you, said no time should be wasted.
Drink of tea?
Thank you, Mistress, but I don't dare.
Would you know of Master Epps's consternation... to be any lessened with your timely return?
Anger's his constant condition.
Sit.
Sit and drink the tea that I offered.
What'n be Epps's concern?
I'd rather not say.
Oh, little gossip on the Sabbath be fine.
All things in moderation.
As you are aware...
Master Epps is a man of hard countenance.
You know he has ill feeling towards your husband.
He do.
Master Epps has somehow come to believe... that Master Shaw is something of a lothario.
A misguided belief, no doubt.
No doubt... if not born out of truth itself.
I meant no disrespect.
He ain't heard you.
I meant no disrespect to you, Mistress.
Got no cause to worry for my sensibilities.
I ain't felt the end of a lash in more years I can recall.
I ain't worked a field, neither.
Where once I served... now, I have others serving me.
The cost to my current existence... be Master Shaw broadcasting his affections... and me enjoying the pantomime of his fidelity.
If that what keep me from cotton picking niggers, that what it be.
A small and reasonable price to be paid, for sure.
I know what it like to be the object of Master's predilections and peculiarities.
A lusty visit in the night... or a visitation with the whip.
Take comfort, Patsey.
The good Lord will manage Epps.
In His own time, the good Lord will manage them all.
The curse of the pharaohs were a poor example... of what wait for the plantation class.
This is nice.
Pats.
Patsey!
Do not look in his direction.
Continue on.
Patsey!
Found her, Master.
And brought her back, just as instructed.
What did you just now tell her?
What did you say to Pats?
No words were spoken, none of consequence.
You're a liar.
You damn liar.
I saw you talking with her.
Tell me.
I cannot speak of what did not occur.
I'll cut your black throat!
Master!
You come here.
Master Epps.
I said come here!
I brought her back, just like you...
Come here!
Master!
Master.
I got her, just as instructed.
Master Epps!
You stay away from Pats, boy.
Master Epps.
It's the Lord's day.
Ain't nothing Christian in us carrying on like this.
I concede to you.
In the name of valor... help your master to his feet.
I'm gonna kill you!
What's the fuss?
Master Epps believed Patsey and me to be in conversation when we were not.
I tried to explain, but it's led to all this.
What is it?
You can't remain the Sabbath without her under your eye?
You are a no-account bastard.
A filthy, godless heathen.
My bed is too holy for you to share.
What's he been telling you?
Of your misbegotten ways.
And he would know what of anything?
I ain't even spoken with him today.
You lying nigger, Platt.
Have I?
Have I?
There.
There's all the truth he got.
Damn nigger.
Patsey.
A moment from the dancing.
Come sample what I baked for y'all.
Thank you, Mistress.
Thank you, Mistress.
There will be none for you, Patsey.
You see that?
You see that look of insolence she give me?
I seen nothing but her turn away.
Are you blind or ignorant?
It was hot, hateful scorn.
It filled that black face.
You tell me you didn't see it... it's because you choose not to look, or are you saying I lie?
Whatever it was, it passed.
Is that how you are with the niggers?
Letting every ill thought fester inside them?
Look at them.
They foul with it.
They foul with their hate.
You let it be, it's gonna come back to us in the dark of night.
You want that?
You want them black animals leave us gut like pigs in our own sleep?
Oh...
You are manless.
A damn eunuch if there ever was.
If you won't stand for me, I pray you'd at least be a credit to your own kind... and beat every foul thought from them.
Beat it from them!
Eat.
Fill yourselves.
And then we dance.
I said, eat.
Platt.
Platt, you awake?
I am.
I have a request.
An act of kindness.
I secreted it from the mistress.
Return it.
It yours, Platt.
For what cause?
All I ask, end my life.
Take my body to the margin of the swamp.
Take me by the throat, hold me low in the water... until I is still and without life.
Bury me in a lonely place of dying.
I will do no such thing.
The gory detail with which you speak...
I thought on it long and hard.
It is melancholia.
Nothing more.
How can you fall into such despair?
How can you not know?
I ain't got no comfort in this life.
If I can't buy mercy from you...
I'll beg it.
There are others.
Beg them.
I'm begging you.
Why?
Why would you consign me to damnation with such an ungodly request?
There is God here!
God is merciful... and he forgive merciful acts.
Won't be no hell for you.
Do it.
Do what I ain't got the strength to do myself.
It's a plague.
It's cotton worm.
It's a plague.
It's damn biblical.
Two seasons God done sent a plague to smite me.
What I done that God hates me so?
It's that godless lot.
They brought this on me.
I bring them God's word and heathens they are, they brung me God's scorn.
Damn!
Damn you!
Damn all y'all!
Judge.
Mister Epps.
I am deeply saddened to hear about your misfortune.
Your price don't reflect your concern.
Listen up.
You're Judge Turner's for the season.
More, if need be, until my crops return.
Y'all bring no disrespect to me.
Don't bring no biblical plagues to him, you hear?
Or I'll take it out on your skin.
Get out.
Get off the porch.
You ain't supposed to be on the porch.
Get off the porch.
Platt, is it?
Yes, sir.
You cultivate cane previously?
No, sir, I have not.
It comes to you quite naturally.
Are you educated?
No, sir.
Niggers are hired to work, not read or write.
You play the fiddle.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I do.
Willard Yarner, a planter up the bayou... celebrates his anniversary in three weeks' time.
I'll hold out your name to him.
What you earn is yours to keep.
Yes, sir.
Mind yourself, Platt. Whoa! Joyous day.
Joyous day.
Dark times is behind us.
Clean living and prayer done lifted the plague!
As thick and white as New England snow.
Now, my niggers is returned to me.
Heard Judge Turner gave you favor.
Did you beguile him, Platt, with your slick nigger ways?
You won't stand idle, boy.
Not on my land.
Much work to do!
Days of old long since, huh?
Joyous.
Joyous, indeed! Whoo!
Let's go find something sweet for you.
Hmm?
Mmm-hmm.
Candy.
Candy?
George.
180 pounds.
Patsey.
520 pounds for Patsey.
That's my girl.
Don't ever let me down.
Platt?
160 pounds.
Armsby?
64 pounds.
A good day's labor would average 200 pounds.
Yes, sir.
I'm sure in time, you'll develop as a picker.
But it takes effort, boy.
Put some damn effort into it.
Yes, sir.
Take them out, get to whipping.
It's a tragedy.
How does such come to pass?
Working a field and picking cotton like a lowly hand.
I'm of a damn sight better station.
I worked as an overseer, you know.
I did not know, sir.
Not "sir."
Just "Armsby."
I'm not owed more than any other in the field.
How did you arrive at such a place, if I may ask?
Ask, it's just conversation.
I became a little too dependent on the whiskey... a little too undependable on the job.
Now, before you say I'm just a sorry drunkard... let me state my case.
As reliable employment as overseeing is, it is no easy chore on the spirit.
I say, no man of conscious... can take the lash to another human day in and day out... without shredding at his own self.
Takes him to a place... where he either makes excuses within his mind to be unaffected... or he finds some way to trample his guilty sensations.
So, I trampled.
With frequency.
I gave in to tales of wealth and prosperity.
But such profitable outcomes are reserved for plantation masters.
It's the lot of the rest of us to serve.
Now, all I want is to earn a decent wage and get myself home.
The proceeds of my fiddling performances.
Just a few picayunes, but all I have in the world.
I promise them to you if you will do me the favor I require.
But I beg you not to expose me if you cannot grant the request.
Uh...
What is it you ask?
First, your word, sir.
On my honor.
It's a simple enough request.
I only ask that you deposit a letter at the post office in Marksville... and that you keep the action an inviolable secret forever.
A patron is what I require, sir.
I'll do it.
And I'll accept whatever payment's offered.
To assist you, I put my own self at risk.
I will do so... but fair compensation is all I ask.
Draw up your letter.
We'll meet again in two days?
In two days.
Thank you.
Well, boy...
I understand I got a learned nigger that writes letters.
Tries to get white fellas to mail them.
Armsby told me today... the devil was among my niggers.
That I had one that needed watching... or he would run away.
When I asked him why... he said you come over to him... waked him up in the middle of the night... and wanted him to carry a letter... to Marksville.
What do you got to say to that?
There's no truth to it.
You say.
How could I write a letter without ink or paper?
Who am I gonna write to?
I got no friends living as I know of.
That Armsby...
That Armsby is a lying, drunken fellow.
Didn't he want you to hire him as an overseer?
Well, that's it.
He wants to make you believe we're all gonna run away... so you'll hire him as an overseer.
He believes you're a soft soap.
And he's given to such talk.
Made this story out of whole cloth... because he wants a situation.
It's all a lie, Master.
It's all a lie.
I'll be damned.
Were he not free and white, Platt.
Were he not free and white.
Edward!
Get him water.
Get up!
Get up!
Nigger, get up!
What you looking at, boy?
Keep picking, boy!
I just wanna say something about Uncle Abram.
He was a good man... and he always looked out for us ever since we were little.
God love him.
God bless him.
God keep him.
Amen.
Went down to the River Jordan
Where John baptized three
When I woke the devil in hell
Said Johnny baptized me
I said roll, Jordan, roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul will rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan roll
Well, some say John was a Baptist
Some say John was a Jew
But I say John was a preacher
'Cause my Bible says so too
I said roll, Jordan, roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul will rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan roll
Hallelujah
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul will rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan roll
Hallelujah
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul will rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan roll
Everybody say
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul will rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan roll
Oh, children
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul will rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan roll
Hallelujah
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul will rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan roll
Right to the end.
Hey, Bass.
Oh, no, no, no.
No shame in taking respite from the heat.
Drink, shade.
It's ungodly for travelers, hearty or otherwise.
What's funny?
Epps, I merely mean to finish the work at hand, as requested.
And as paid for.
If something rubs you wrongly...
I offer you the opportunity to speak on it.
You ask plainly, so I will tell you plainly.
What amused me just then was your concern for my well-being in this heat... when, quite frankly, the condition of your laborers...
"The condition of my laborers"?
It is horrid.
It's all wrong.
All wrong, Mr. Epps.
They ain't hired help.
They're my property.
You say that with pride.
I say it as fact.
If this conversation concerns what is factual and what is not, then it must be said... that there is no justice nor righteousness in their slavery.
But you do open up an interesting question.
What right have you to your niggers, when you come down to the point?
What right? Mmm.
I bought them.
I paid for them.
Of course you did, and the law says you have the right to hold a nigger.
But begging the law's pardon, it lies.
Suppose they pass a law taking away your liberty, making you a slave.
Suppose.
That ain't a supposable case.
Laws change, Epps.
Universal truths are constant.
It is a fact, a plain and simple fact... that what is true and right is true and right for all.
White and black alike.
You comparing me to a nigger, Bass?
I'm only asking, in the eyes of God, what is the difference?
You might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon.
I seen one of them critters in Orleans.
Know just as much as any nigger I got.
Listen, Epps.
These niggers are human beings.
If they are allowed to climb no higher than brute animals... you and men like you will have to answer for it.
There is an ill, Mr. Epps... a fearful ill resting upon this nation.
And there will be a day of reckoning yet.
You like to hear yourself talk, Bass... better than any man I know of.
You'd argue that black was white, or white, black... if anybody would contradict you.
A fine supposition if you lived among Yankees in New England.
But you don't.
You most assuredly do not.
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!
Patsey!
Pats!
Where is she?
Where's Pats?
Where is she, damn it?
Where is she?
Phebs, where is she?
Where is Patsey?
Where is she?
What you standing there for?
We know nothing of her, Master.
Know nothing of what?
We know nothing of...
Of what?
Where has she gone?
She run off, ain't she?
I don't know, Master.
Where is she?
I don't know, Master.
You know, you know, you know!
You know!
No, I don't!
You miserable black dogs.
You stand like the deaf and dumb.
Speak!
She gone.
My Pats is gone.
Run off?
Run off, did you?
Master Epps...
You miserable wench.
Where you been?
I been nowhere!
Lies to your misdeeds!
The Sabbath day, Master.
I took me a walk to commune with the Lord.
Bring the Lord into your deceptions?
You're coming from Shaw's plantation.
No!
Master Epps.
Now, you speak?
Now that you want to add to her lies, you find your tongue!
I went to Master Shaw's plantation.
Ah!
You admit it.
Yes, freely.
And you know why?
I got this from Mistress Shaw.
Mistress Epps won't even grant me no soap to clean with.
I stink so much, I make myself gag!
500 pounds of cotton.
Day in, day out!
More than any man here.
And for that, I will be clean.
That's all I ask.
This, here, what I went to Shaw's for.
Liar.
The Lord knows that's all!
You're a liar.
And you, blind with your own covetousness!
I don't lie, Master.
If you kill me, I'll stick to that.
I'll fetch you down.
I'll learn you to go to Shaw's.
Treach.
Run and fetch some line.
Edward!
Strip her.
Strike her bare and lash her to the post.
You done this to yourself, Pats.
Do it.
Strike the life from her.
Beat her.
Give her the whip!
Give it all to her!
Platt, you come here and you beat her now.
Platt!
Come here!
I'd rather it you, Platt!
You strike her.
Strike her.
He pantomimes.
There's barely a welt on her.
That's what your niggers make of you... a fool for the taking.
Strike her, Platt.
Strike her!
You will strike her.
You will strike her until her flesh is rent and meat and blood flow equal... or I will kill every nigger in my sight.
You understand me?
Strike her!
Strike her!
Until I say no more. I ain't said nothing!
Give me the whip!
Get up!
Thou devil!
Sooner or later... somewhere in the course of eternal justice, thou shalt answer for this sin!
Sin?
There is no sin.
Man does how he pleases with his property.
At the moment, Platt, I'm of great pleasure.
You be goddamn careful I don't want to come and lighten my mood no further.
Master Bass.
I want to ask you what part of the country you come from.
No part of this land.
I originate from Canada.
Now, guess where that is.
I know where Canada is.
I've been there myself.
Montreal... and Kingston and Queenston and a great many places.
Well-traveled for a slave.
How came you here?
Master Bass... if justice had been done, I never would have been here.
How's this?
Tell me all.
I'm afraid to tell you.
Every word you speak is a profound secret.
Your story... it is amazing.
And in no good way.
Do you believe, sir, in justice, as you said?
I do.
That slavery is an evil that should befall none?
I believe so.
If you truly do... then I ask, I beg... that you write my friends in the north... acquainting them of my situation... and beseeching them to forward free papers.
It would be... an unspeakable happiness... to see my wife... and my family again.
I traveled this country for the best part of 20 years... and my freedom is everything.
The fact that I can walk out of here tomorrow brings me great pleasure.
My life doesn't mean much to anyone.
It seems yours might mean a lot to a whole lot of people.
But what you ask of me, sir, scares me.
And I must say, I am afraid.
Not just for you, but for me.
I will write your letter, sir.
And if it brings you your freedom, it will be more than a pleasure.
It will have been my duty.
Now, would you kindly hand me those shingles?
Platt!
Where's the boy called Platt?
Come here, boy.
Your name is Platt, is it?
Yes, sir.
You know that man?
Mr. Parker.
Say again?
Mr. Parker.
That man received a letter compiling many accusations.
You look me in the eye... and on your life, you answer me truthfully.
Have you any other name than Platt?
Solomon Northup is my name.
Sheriff, what's all this?
It's official business.
My nigger, my business.
Your business waits.
Tell me of your family.
I have a wife, two children.
What the hell?
What are your children's names?
Margaret and Alonzo.
What was your wife's name before her marriage?
Anne Hampton.
I am who I say.
Where you going, Platt?
Who authorized you to interfere with my property?
My authority.
Platt, you come back here.
Platt!
You come back here, boy.
Boy.
You unhand him.
Platt is my nigger!
He is Mr. Solomon Northup.
You say.
You come here, unfamiliar to me, and make claims.
I got no doubts.
The man is Solomon Northup.
The hell he is!
He's my nigger, and I'll fight you for him!
As is your right.
As it will be my pleasure to bankrupt you in the courts.
Your decision.
Unhand him.
I know you had some hand in this, Platt.
I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.
Pay him no mind.
I paid good money for this nigger.
Courthouse got papers to prove it!
And we got papers proving he's free!
I own you.
You belong to me.
You hear me, Platt?
Unhand him!
You'll have 200 stripes across your back by sundown!
Platt!
Get my horse, Treach.
Get away from him, Pats.
I'm gonna be seeing you real soon.
Solomon, we need to make haste.
No.
Solomon.
I'll apologize... for my appearance.
But I have had... a difficult time... these past several years.
Margaret.
Alonzo.
Who is this?
He's my husband.
Husband.
It is very good to meet you, sir.
We have much acquainting to do.
Yes, sir.
And this is your grandson.
Solomon Northup Staunton.
Solomon.
Anne... forgive me.
There is nothing to forgive.
With every sun comes a new day.
A new beginning.
A hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday.
But not for me.
My name is Eep.
And this is my family, the Croods.
If you weren't clued in already by the animal skins and sloping foreheads, we're cavemen.
Most days we spend in our cave, in the dark.
Night after night, day after day.
Yep, home sweet home.
When we did go out, we struggled to find food in a harsh and hostile world.
And I struggled to survive my family.
We were the last ones around.
There used to be neighbors.
The Sorts, smashed by a mammoth.
The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.
The Erfs, mosquito bite.
Throgs, common cold.
And the Croods, that's us.
The Croods made it, because of my dad.
He was strong, and he followed the rules.
The ones painted on the cave walls.
Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad.
Going out at night is bad.
Basically, anything fun is bad.
Welcome to my world.
But this is a story about how all that changed in an instant.
Because what we didn't know was that our world... was about to come to an end.
And there were no rules on our cave walls to prepare us for that.
You are supposed to wait for my signal.
Eep?
Boo.
Ow! No!
We've been in that cave forever.
Three days is not forever.
It is with this family.
Eep, would you come down here?
You're being so dramatic.
No, Sandy, come back here.
Remember the signal.
Good girls wait for the signal. Ugga.
As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in, and you can give the signal.
No, I mean, you're already out now.
I'm waiting for the signal, Dad.
Never mind, Thunk.
Just come out.
But if you don't give the signal, how do I know you're my dad?
The signal isn't so you know it's me.
It's so you know I wasn't eaten by an animal.
Then why is the signal an animal noise?
Doesn't that just confuse things?
I don't know.
I'm still waiting for the signal.
Mom, we're ready to leave.
Mom?
Still alive.
It's still early.
And you're still fat.
Breakfast formation!
I want to see some real caveman action out there.
We do this fast.
We do this loud.
We do this as a family.
And never not be afraid!
Yay, breakfast.
Who's up?
We'll flip for it.
Call her in the air.
Heads!
Tails.
Thunk is in. Positions.
Okay. Thunk--
Go.
Come on, Thunk.
Way to go.
Take it to the cave.
Release the baby!
Get them, Sandy!
Go!
Get them, Mom!
Old lady down!
Eep, avenge me!
Thanks.
Eep!
Heads up!
Hey Dad, can we eat now?
Just wait till we get home.
Eep, put on the brakes.
Eep!
- Who is hungry?
- All right!
Good one, Dad.
- Sorry, Dad.
- Looks like fast food tonight.
That's all right.
I ate last week.
Two knuckle warning!
Come on, Croods.
Go, go.
Come on, come on.
Darkness brings death.
We know this.
The moon is full.
Bath night.
- Run for your life!
- You too, Mom.
I don't want to lose my protective layer.
Mom, you've got ants.
See?
Sandy doesn't fuss.
Is she still out there?
You know she hates the cave, Grug.
Please come back tomorrow.
How could she not like the cave?
It's so cozy.
It is a little dark, Grug.
It's not that dark.
Eep!
Eep?
Come on, I have to close the cave.
Eep!
Okay, Okay-
Come on.
Eep!
Come down!
- That was too close.
- I was watching.
I was fine.
- What were you doing up there, Eep?
- I don't know.
- What were you looking for?
- Nothing.
- Then why did you go up there?
- I don't know.
Why don't you know?
Stop looking for things.
Fear keeps us alive, Eep.
Never not be afraid.
What is the point of all this?
What was that?
Why are we here?
What are we doing this for?
No one said survival was fun.
Nothing is fun.
- Would you come down here?
- Grug.
- Eep.
- Grug.
- Yes.
- Off!
- Yes, I know.
Okay, I'm trying to--
- Off.
I just don't see why she needs her own ledge, that's all.
- That's what this is about.
- She's working through some things... and she needs her own space.
What things?
How long is this going to take?
Really?
She already doesn't listen to me.
Hey!
See?
She's listening.
If she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules.
How about a story?
Eep loves those.
That's a good ide-- How about a story, huh?
Yeah, tell us a story.
Okay.
Can I borrow that?
Thank you.
Eep, your old favorite.
I haven't played with that thing in years.
Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy Bear.
A long time ago, this little bear was alive.
She was alive because she listened to her father... and lived her life in routine and darkness and terror.
So she was happy.
But Krispy had one terrible problem.
She was filled with... curiosity.
- Grug.
- Yes.
Yes.
And one day, while she was in a tree... the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top.
And no sooner than she climbed to the top... she saw something new and died!
- Just like that?
- Yes!
Her last moments of terror still frozen on her face.
Same ending as every day.
I get it, Dad.
I will never do anything new or different.
Good man, Thunk.
All right, everyone sharpen your teeth, and let's pile up.
Air.
You talk.
I'm a person, like you.
Sort of like you.
Okay, Okay-
Hey, hey, hey!
Would you mind not--
That tickles.
Hey, hey, hey!
Quiet!
I'm not supposed to be out here.
Eep is gone.
What?
Grug!
Stay in the cave.
Wow.
You are really strong.
Hey!
No!
It's mine.
- Please! Wait.
- No!
- It's dying!
I can fix it! - No!
I caught it!
Please! Please.
I hate the dark.
Come on, come on, come on.
It does what you tell it?
Yeah.
Sort of.
The sun?
No, no, no.
Fire.
Hi, fire.
It's not alive.
But you said it was dying.
Sorry.
It comes from where you come from?
No.
No, I make it.
- Make some for me.
- Okay.
Make!
It doesn't come out of me.
Make!
Make it!
You do this a lot.
Are you dead?
Can I have your fire if you're dead?
Clear!
Hey, those are cold!
You think?
Listening shells, activate.
I concur.
Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately.
I don't even know you.
I'm Guy.
Guy?
And this is Belt.
Cook, conversationalist, navigator.
Also, keeps my pants up.
What are "pants up"?
Who are you?
Eep.
Let me clarify, Eep.
The world is ending.
What?
I'm calling it "The End."
How do you know?
I have seen it.
It's coming this way.
First, the ground is going to shake.
Then it breaks open. Everything falls in.
Fire.
Lava.
I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but--
Believe me, everything we are standing on will be gone.
We got to get to high ground.
I know a mountain, that way.
It's our only chance.
Come with me.
I can't.
Okay.
Here.
If you survive, call me.
Thank you.
Hello?
Hey!
Dad!
Are you hurt?
What took you?
Nothing.
I left on my own.
You what?
Dad, let me explain.
You never let me talk.
You're grounded.
Hey!
Eep!
Mom.
Grug!
What happened?
You know what, I am so mad right now that I can't talk to her.
Eep?
You will never believe it.
I found something new.
New!
New is a big problem!
Wait, wait!
Eep.
Stay inside the family kill circle.
- It wasn't bad.
- "New" is always bad.
No.
He was nice.
What?
Excuse me? He?
I thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy.
Strange.
Usually it's the reverse.
Eep's got a boy hog.
Eep's got a boy--
There was a boy.
Watch.
I'm going to call him.
What is wrong with you?
It was dangerous.
It was beautiful!
You want to see dangerous?
Here!
My sniffer!
Okay, that's it!
We're going back to the cave... and you're going to stay in there until you're older than... her!
What!
You can't keep me inside forever!
He said this would happen.
Get to the cave!
Go!
Look out!
Stop!
Is everyone okay?
Yes.
Grug, the cave... it's gone.
No.
You really need to see this.
We should go there!
No.
No one is going anywhere.
What else did that boy say?
Grug?
Just go!
Just go!
Go!
One, two, three, four, five--
Six.
Where are we?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
Down.
In a lower place.
But one thing is for sure, we can't go back the way we came.
Sandy?
What is it?
No, no, no.
Wait.
Come back, Sandy!
We can't be out in the open like this.
We need a cave.
Now, step where I step.
Okay.
Stay quiet.
Hopefully, nothing big knows we're here yet.
Wait.
Okay.
Wait.
Okay.
Wait!
Wait.
Okay.
Wait.
Wait.
So, Dad... just to be clear, are we looking for the exact same cave?
If it was me-- I'm just throwing this out there... if it was me choosing the cave...
I would go with a smaller cave.
Wait.
Dad?
I'll take care of this.
All right, Dad, get them!
Go get them!
Now you got them right--
Man, they're really--
I'm loving this.
Dad, I got it.
Just stop running into their fists.
Grug, when you're done, we should get going.
That's right.
You can't get past this!
Climb!
Climb!
Climb!
Cave!
Go!
Go!
Come on! Hurry up.
Let's go.
Look!
This cave has a tongue.
Awesome!
Okay.
That's one, two, three, four, five, six.
And seven... if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.
It's scared of the dark.
Wait, we're scared of the dark.
Kill circle!
Eep!
Eep!
- Cavies!
- "Cavies"?
Cavemen!
Stand back!
They're practically animals.
- You see their bony, sloping foreheads?
- Yeah.
The huge primitive teeth?
Yeah.
The excessive body hair.
That one has got a tail.
Yeah.
All right.
Close your eyes.
I'm going to have to take their lives.
No!
It won't help.
They're my family.
What?
The sun is in his hands!
No, no.
It's "fire."
Where did it come from?
He made it.
Make some for me!
It doesn't come out of him.
Make.
Make it!
You're a lot like your daughter.
Great, now he's broken.
It's a baby sun.
Hey, stay back.
We don't know what it wants.
Now, we'll all sit here and wait for the sun to come back.
And tomorrow we'll find a new cave... and pretend today never happened.
Isn't this fun, Eep?
Eep, don't touch him.
Goodness knows where he's been.
Dad, Sandy is hurting fire.
Sandy, no.
Fire is not a plaything.
What a cute little guy.
Hey.
Stay back.
No, no, no, wait!
It likes me.
Hey!
It's biting me!
Thunk!
Try hiding from it in the tall, dry grass!
No, stop.
Please, I'm only nine.
They're biting me!
More fire babies.
Hi.
So, your dad, he is trying to kill me.
Yeah.
But I won't let him.
Hold on, son.
Come back!
No, stop!
Let me go!
Get out!
Out!
Out!
Eat up, babies!
No, stop touching me!
Die!
I win!
They're not so scary once you get to know them.
Who are you people?
I'm sorry.
We're the Croods!
And you are?
Guy.
Hi, Guy.
Wow!
It looks like magic.
And smells like food.
No, don't eat it, it's new.
Still alive!
Come on, keep eating.
Hey, where is Guy?
No!
Going somewhere?
The mountain?
High ground?
End of the world, remember?
That already happened.
It destroyed our cave.
No.
That was just the beginning of the end.
The end of the end is still coming.
Eep.
Drop it.
We can't let him go!
What if we don't find a cave before sunset?
What if it takes a few days?
What if the birds come back?
We need his fire, dummy!
Fine.
You're staying with us until we find a cave.
What?
No, I'm not.
Don't make me a part of this!
Stay here if you want, but let me go.
I've got a dream... a mission, a reason to live!
Not anymore.
I've got an idea.
Let's go to that mountain.
It's too far.
Dad really has his heart set on a cave.
There are caves on that mountain.
Have you been there?
It's a mountain.
Mountains are safe.
Mountains have caves.
And water. And sticks.
Mom?
Did you hear that?
I can get my own stick!
Yes.
Sticks and caves.
Caves and sticks.
Crazy sticks.
Let's go.
Quiet!
That thing is weird.
No, no, no.
It's okay, Sandy.
That's just Belt.
I've made a decision.
We're going to that mountain.
Don't ask me why.
Just a hunch.
Just feels right.
I don't know, Grug.
We've never really walked that far.
I don't think my feet can do that.
I'll never live long enough to get there.
Let's do it.
Come on, just think.
Our whole family packed together on a long, slow, trip across country?
Days and nights with just each other.
We'll tell stories.
We'll laugh.
We'll become closer as a family.
Get her off!
If you're not ready to challenge her, then don't look her in the eye.
Could you keep your big giant arms on your side of the trail?
Isn't this fun?
We're taking our first trip together.
Stop shoving, or I will pull out your tongue!
Do you want me to turn this family around?
Do you?
Because I will turn this family around so fast!
Dad, I gotta 90!
- Come on, you can hold it.
- I don't think so.
Sandy, take that out of your mouth.
- I'm touching--
- Gran.
Dad, I still gotta go!
Fine.
Just go behind one of those lumpy things and make it fast.
- Something bit me!
- I don't blame it.
Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?
No.
- How about now?
- No.
- Now?
- No.
Now?
I can do this all day long.
No, no, no and still no.
I'm not dying on an empty stomach.
Grug, we're all pretty tired!
We'll eat when we get there.
It's taking too long!
I'm grabbing a snack.
Don't do that.
He will cut you.
That's not food, he's a pet.
What's a pet?
An animal you don't eat.
We call those "children."
No man should have a pet.
It's weird and wrong.
- It's food!
- No, please!
Not that. That!
Food fixes everything.
Show me your hunting face.
Not you.
You're still grounded.
Come on, Thunk.
My feet hurt.
- You look tense.
- I'm not tense.
Angry girl wants to be doing what they're doing.
I wasn't ready.
Hang on, Thunk, I'm coming!
Why are you doing this?
What are they doing?
Hunting.
Get it off!
You stay away from me.
No, seriously, what are they doing?
You've got a ton of eggs.
Just make another egg.
Now you're just rubbing it in.
There, who's hungry for scorpion?
What happened to the egg and the bird?
We lost him.
But when the bird stepped on me and pushed me into the ground... the scorpion grabbed a hold of me... and one thing led to another and here we are eating him.
So, win-win.
Not enough.
Not enough!
I need more.
I need more.
Look at that.
She's not going to eat me, right?
You're too skinny.
If she was going to eat anyone it would be--
Mom!
She's locked her jaw!
Get a stick!
Get a stick!
Stay away!
You sick old monster!
Hurry!
Put the stick in her mouth!
Hold her still.
Use a rock.
Ugga, would you just hit her legs?
Why are you rolling away?
I just want something to eat.
You have bug for dinner.
Plenty of bug!
Please.
I'll let you help me hunt.
Really?
Don't wait on me.
They're all over me.
Tell my story.
Okay.
What do you call this?
A trap.
What does it do?
Well--
How long have you been alone?
So, what do we do?
How's your acting?
You're good at this.
No.
Sorry.
Okay.
- Yeah, that's yours.
- Excuse me.
Your other hand--
- That's my arm.
- Okay, I'm moving it.
Going under.
It didn't step in your trap-y thing.
Yeah, I noticed!
Where's Eep?
She's awesome.
Eep!
Dad, no!
It's an avalanche of flavor.
Looks like we won't be having any leftovers.
What are "left overs"?
When you have so much food to eat, you have some left over.
We never have that much food.
Grug, how about a story?
That's a good idea.
How about a story?
Yeah, tell us a story!
Once upon a time, there was a little tiger... who lived in a cave with her family.
There were a lot of rules... but the big, simple one was to never leave the cave at night.
And the door was so heavy, you'd think it would be easy to remember.
So easy to remember!
I know.
But, while everyone was asleep... she went out anyway.
"No!
'Yes!
And no sooner than she did, their cave was destroyed... and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk... with some weirdo they met... and die!
The end.
I did not see that coming.
Twist ending.
My stories never end like that.
Yes!
Two stories in one night!
Okay.
But it won't be as good as Grug's.
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger.
She lived in a cave with the rest of her family.
Her father and mother told her, "You may go anywhere you want...
"but never go near the cliff, for you could fall."
And die.
Good story.
But when no one was looking... she'd go near the cliff... for the closer she came to the edge... the more she could hear, the more she could see... the more she could feel.
Finally... she stood at the very edge.
She saw a light.
She leaned out to touch it... and she slipped.
And she fell.
And she flew.
Where did she fly?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
A place with more suns in the sky than you can count.
It would be so bright.
A place not like today, or yesterday.
A place where things are better.
Tomorrow isn't a place.
You can't see it!
Yes, it is.
I've seen it.
That's where I'm going.
We are going to shut our eyes and sleep.
And when we wake up... we're going to find the place that has everything we want.
Tomorrow?
A cave.
That was too close. It almost caught us.
I was watching.
We were fine.
We gotta move faster.
Do you people have any other speed aside from "wander"?
I'll take a shamble at this point.
Hey, do you have a minute?
How did the tiger fly?
I only share when I'm outside the log.
I'm funny that way.
Leave this to me.
Hey, Thunk... you have a spider on your face.
Oops.
He's loose!
Do not step on those weird pointy rocks.
Do you mean these rocks?
Do not step on these rocks!
Step aside, girls.
Hello?
Nobody's listening!
No one is listening.
You cannot walk on those!
Get back here now!
There goes our chance for survival.
And our log!
Okay.
Jumping doesn't help.
It does briefly... but it doesn't get better.
How about--
Don't walk on your hands.
The hands do not help at all.
Come on.
I can help you... but we're going to have to make a few changes around here.
The log ride is over.
Drop the log.
Now, kick it away.
Farther.
Really?
Okay, smart "Guy"... now what?
Good fish, good fish.
Okay.
Now you can look.
I love them!
Where are my feet?
They're still there!
Okay.
You're really heavy.
Really?
Thank you!
Hey.
Wait!
Okay.
She's up.
We're good.
I'm good.
These shoes are great!
Where do you get these ideas?
I'm calling it a "brain."
I'm pretty sure it's where ideas come from.
Dad, I don't have a brain.
We've gotten along just fine without brains until now.
Cavemen don't need brains.
We have these.
That's what I'm talking about!
Ideas are for weaklings.
Now, let's get to that mountain!
Wow!
I love those!
Good fish.
Don't eat my feet.
So, how did the tiger fly?
She jumped on the sun... and rode it to Tomorrow.
No, no, no.
Hi, Dad!
Bye. Dad!
You've seen rain before, right?
We don't get out much.
Eep, looks dangerous.
Dad, you say that about everything.
Careful.
Really?
Okay.
No, no, no.
Not cool!
So, the bear says, "Your cave?
I've been dumping my bones here since last week."
Last week!
That's a funny story!
It's not a story.
It's a joke.
What's a "joke"?
Just making something up to make you laugh.
- One for you.
- Thanks.
One for you.
And this one's for you.
Okay.
Okay!
That's enough!
I don't see why the kids need their own shells.
So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call the others.
Wait, you're saying we should split up?
We can try more paths at once.
It's the fastest way through.
Croods stick together.
Your way isn't safe.
They can handle it.
We can do it, Dad.
No, no, no.
It's my job to keep you safe.
I'm still in charge and we are not splitting up.
Except for you two.
And that's final.
Hello?
Is everyone all right?
We're okay, Grug.
Dad?
I'm freaking out a little bit.
Just tell me what to do.
What do I do?
What do I do right now?
Stay where you are.
I'll find you.
No.
Too slow.
Everybody, keep moving forward and we'll get out.
Dad?
Yeah.
Okay.
Remember, never not be afraid.
You can do this!
It's going to be okay, it's going to be okay.
I'm going to pass out.
Sandy.
Sandy!
Give me another one.
You dropped these.
Come with me.
Here, boy! Catch!
Yoo-hoo!
Gran?
Mom?
Wow.
Grug?
I'll go get him.
Good boy!
Who's a good boy?
You are!
Yes, you are!
Look at you!
You need a name.
You want a name?
I'm going to call you Douglas.
Can you do tricks?
Roll over.
Come on, Douglas, roll over.
Good boy, Douglas!
I was in love once.
He was a hunter.
I was a gatherer.
It was quite a scandal.
We fed each other berries, we danced.
Then my father smashed him with a rock and traded me to your grandfather.
Croods!
Get down here.
Grug, they're okay.
Guy is with them.
Guy is with them.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you for bringing me that interesting Guy update.
I'm going to go up... and why don't you join us when you stop being a big drag!
Sleep pile?
How about a story?
Anyone?
And then Torg said, "Know it?
I drew it."
That makes no sense.
I know it was hard for you to bring us along... but they had the best day of their lives.
Thank you for that.
I want to show you something.
More suns in the sky than you can count.
Every sun that crosses our sky comes to rest up there.
Tomorrow.
That's where we'll be safe.
I'm going with Guy.
No.
Not my little girl.
Come with us.
I can't go without Grug.
That makes one of us. Count me in.
Really, Mom?
Now?
Grug has no idea how to protect us.
In fact, he has no ideas at all!
No, that's not true.
What about that one time when he...
Face it.
If he actually had an idea of his own...
I'd have a heart attack and die!
Grug?
'Dad!
'Dad!
He's a big guy.
How could he just disappear like that?
Hey, wait!
Let's ask that ugly lady if she's seen Dad.
Haven't seen him.
What are you doing?
Yeah.
I was up all night, because all these ideas just kept coming to me.
Is that a snake?
Belt, new and improved.
It's even self-tightening!
What is that on your head?
It's called desperation.
I call it a "rug." Rhymes with "Grug."
And this one, I call it a "ride."
Rhymes with "Grug."
That doesn't rhyme--
It's going to get us places faster than shoes.
Yeah!
Try to keep up!
I wish I had a ride.
And painting is a thing of the past.
I call this a "snapshot."
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.
I call them "shades."
The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore.
Where do you get these great ideas?
Since I don't have a brain... they're coming from my stomach, down deep below... and then up again into my mind.
Grug, we have to keep moving.
See, I got ideas.
I got thoughts.
Like this.
I call it a "mobile home."
Isn't that something?
And I'm calling this one a "lifterator."
Mom?
I know.
It's bad.
I almost feel sorry for him.
No, I don't.
What are you trying to do, Grug?
See, I thought if I could have ideas... like Guy... maybe Eep would listen to me.
And maybe she wouldn't want to go with Guy.
Grug.
Is that what this is all about?
And I also thought it would kill your mother.
So win-win.
We're here!
Wow.
Cave!
Everyone inside.
Hurry up.
Let's go.
Let's go.
No!
No more caves, Grug.
What?
We're going to jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy!
Wait.
So you're all going to do this?
Thunk?
Sorry, Dad.
You have to stop worrying for all of us.
It's my job to worry!
It's my job to follow the rules!
The rules don't work out here!
They kept us alive!
That wasn't living!
That was just not dying.
There's a difference.
Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me.
We would be dead if we listened to you!
We have to follow Guy now.
Guy.
Guy?
Run.
This is pointless!
We're running out of time.
Everything is collapsing.
You're being irrational and counterproductive!
Big words anger me!
Keep talking.
Countermeasures!
You remember how you were this morning?
You changed.
Idea man.
Modern man.
I am a caveman!
No, no, no, wait!
No!
What is this stuff that saves you from my punches?
Tar.
No.
I have to get back to them.
Stop struggling.
No!
Grug, stop!
No one gets out of this.
Believe me...
I know.
You r--
Family.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I was little when it happened.
Last thing my parents told me was...
"Don't hide.
"Live.
"Follow the sun.
"You'll make it to Tomorrow."
You followed the light.
My daughter is a lot like you.
No.
She's like you.
She loves you, but always forgets to say it.
Just like you forget to tell her.
I guess I was just busy keeping them all alive.
It's okay.
That's what dads do.
That's right.
But we can't do that from here.
We need one of your ideas.
Come on.
You can do it.
Belt!
Emergency Idea Generator, activate!
I've got it.
Wow.
Yeah, I know.
But he's doing the best with what he has.
Let's go.
There he is.
Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity.
Move me.
Okay, he sees us.
That's our cue.
Now, work it!
He's not coming over.
I don't think our puppet looks scared enough.
Scared?
I'll show you scared.
Hand me those acting sticks!
Hold on!
Yes!
You did it.
- Grug!
- Dad!
Hey!
We're okay!
Yeah.
We're okay.
Grug, your call.
Take us to Tomorrow.
Hurry!
Come on!
We're going to make it!
You were right.
There it is! The sun!
We can do it!
We can ride it to Tomorrow!
Run!
I don't understand.
The sun was right here.
It was right here.
We have to go back to the cave.
Hurry, hurry, hurry-
Stay together.
Let's keep moving.
Move, move, move.
Everybody, hold my hand.
Thunk, let's go.
Go, go, go.
Let's stay together.
Grug.
What's wrong with you?
Grug, we'll die if we stay here!
Grug, listen to me.
We've got to get back to that cave.
No more dark.
No more hiding.
No more caves.
What's the point of all this?
To follow the light.
I can't change.
I don't have ideas.
But I have my strength.
And right now... that's all you need.
No, we don't know what's over there.
Maybe nothing!
It's too risky!
It's a chance.
I'll take that chance.
I've wanted to throw you away ever since I met you.
That's a joke, right?
What's a "joke"?
He made it!
He made it.
Okay, Thunk.
Your turn.
You're not coming, are you?
When you make it, so will I.
No!
You did good.
Dadda!
Gran--
No mush.
Just throw me.
Wait.
You surprised me today... lunkhead.
Still alive!
Time to go.
No.
I have too much to say to you.
I need to fix everything, and I don't have time.
I can fix it.
This works good.
What do you call it?
I was thinking of calling it a "hug."
Because it rhymes with "Grug."
But you can change it if you want.
No.
I like "hug."
I love you.
I--
Dad...
I'm scared.
Never be afraid.
There!
I see him!
Hey!
Hey, I did it!
Back!
Stay back!
Stay back!
They're in trouble.
Hang on, I'm coming!
How do I get across?
I have to think.
What would Guy do?
What would Guy do, what would Guy do?
What would I do?
Hold this.
Wave... an idea!
Run!
Yes!
Douglas?
Hey, I know that guy.
Hold on!
It's not safe here.
I'll tell her.
I never got to tell him.
Eep, if your dad were here, he would tell you to--
Get out of the way!
Wow.
You sound just like him.
Get out of the way!
Dadda!
He did it!
He's riding the sun.
But, not very well.
Everybody out of the way!
- Dad!
- Grug!
Where's the danger?
Who blew their shell?
I love you, too!
One, two, three, four... five... six... and seven.
And a half.
And eight.
Nine.
Douglas!
Dad, you saved him!
A boy has to have a pet.
Turns out I'm a cat person.
No.
You really need to see this.
We should go there.
Yes!
Coming through!
Wait!
This is me.
My name is Eep.
And this is my family, the Croods.
If you weren't clued in by the suntans and pets... we're not exactly cavemen anymore.
Let's do it again.
I think I blinked.
Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile... but now we know the Croods will make it.
Because we changed the rules... the ones that kept us in the dark.
And because of my dad, who taught us that anyone can change.
Release the baby!
Sort of.
So, from now on, we'll stay out here... where we can follow the light.
On your left.
On your left.
Uh-huh. On my left.
Got it.
Don't say it.
Don't you say it.
- On your left.
- Come on!
Need a medic?
I need a new set of lungs.
Dude, you just ran, like, 13 miles in 30 minutes.
I guess I got a late start.
Really?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You should take another lap.
Did you just take it? I assume you just took it.
What unit you with?
58th Pararescue.
But now I'm working down at the VA.
- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.
I kind of put that together.
Must have freaked you out, coming home after the whole defrosting thing.
It takes some getting used to.
It's good to meet you, Sam.
It's your bed, right?
What's that?
Your bed, it's too soft.
When I was over there, I'd sleep on the ground, use rock for pillows, like a caveman.
Now I'm home, lying in my bed, and it's like...
Lying on a marshmallow.
Feel like I'm gonna sink right to the floor.
How long?
Two tours.
You must miss the good old days, huh?
Well, things aren't so bad.
Food's a lot better.
We used to boil everything.
No polio is good.
Internet, so helpful.
I've been reading that a lot, trying to catch up.
Marvin Gaye, 1972, Trouble Man soundtrack.
Everything you missed jammed into one album.
I'll put it on the list.
All right, Sam, duty calls.
Thanks for the run.
If that's what you want to call running.
Oh, that's how it is?
- Oh, that's how it is.
Any time you want to stop by the VA, make me look awesome in front of the girl at the front desk, just let me know.
- I'll keep it in mind.
- Yeah.
Hey, fellas.
Either one of you know where the Smithsonian is?
I'm here to pick up a fossil.
That's hilarious.
- How you doing? - Hey.
Can't run everywhere.
No, you can't.
Target is a mobile satellite launch platform, the Lemurian Star.
They were sending up their last payload when pirates took them, 93 minutes ago.
- Any demands?
- Billion and a half.
- Why so steep?
- Because it's S.H.l. E.L.D.'s.
So it's not off-course. It's trespassing.
I'm sure they have a good reason.
You know, I'm getting a little tired of being Fury's janitor.
Relax.
It's not that complicated.
How many pirates?
25.
Top mercs led by this guy.
Georges Batroc.
Ex-DGSE, Action Division.
He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice.
Before the French demobilised him, he had 36 kill missions.
This guy's got a rep for maximum casualties.
Hostages?
Oh, mostly techs.
One officer.
Jasper Sitwell.
They're in the galley.
What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship?
All right, I'm gonna sweep the deck and find Batroc.
Nat, you kill the engines and wait for instructions.
Rumlow, you sweep aft, find the hostages, get them to the life-pods, get them out.
Let's move. S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap. Gear up.
Secure channel seven.
Seven secure.
Did you do anything fun Saturday night?
Well, all the guys from my barbershop quartet are dead, so, no, not really.
Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.
You know, if you ask Kristen out, from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.
That's why I don't ask.
Too shy, or too scared?
Too busy!
Was he wearing a parachute?
No.
No, he wasn't.
Hey!
Don't move.
Thanks.
Yeah. You seemed pretty helpless without me.
What about the nurse that lives across the hall from you?
She seems kind of nice.
Secure the engine room, then find me a date.
I'm multi-tasking.
I told Batroc...
If we want to make S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us... start sending them bodies now!
I have a bullet for someone...
You want a bullet in your head?
Move that foot - you want a bullet in the head...?
I don't like waiting.
Call Durand.
I want this ship ready to move when the ransom comes.
Start the engines.
Okay-
Hey, sailor.
All right, I've waited long enough...
Hey!
Find Botroc...
If I don't hear anything in two minutes... I start killing them!
I'll find him.
Two minutes.
Radio silence from S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...
Targets acquired.
S.T.R.I.K.E. in position.
Natasha, whats your status?
Status, Natasha.
Hang on!
Engine room secure.
Time is up.
Who dies first...?
You!
Get that one.
On my mark.
Three...
Two... One.
I told you, S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't negotiate.
The line just went dead.
I've lost contact with them...
Hostages en route to extraction.
Romanoff missed the rendezvous point, Cap.
Hostiles are still in play.
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.
Circle back to Rumlow and protect the hostages.
Natasha.
I thought you were more than just a shield...
Let's see.
Well, this is awkward.
What are you doing?
Backing up the hard drive.
It's a good habit to get into.
Rumlow needed your help.
What the hell are you doing here?
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
Whatever I can get my hands on.
Our mission is to rescue hostages.
No, that's your mission, and you've done it beautifully.
You just jeopardised this whole operation.
I think that's overstating things.
Okay.
That one's on me.
You're damn right.
You just can't stop yourself from lying, can you?
I didn't lie.
Agent Romanoff had a different mission than yours.
Which you didn't feel obliged to share.
I'm not obliged to do anything.
Those hostages could have died, Nick.
I sent the greatest soldier in history to make sure that didn't happen.
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.
Not a bunch of guys running around shooting guns.
Last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye.
Look, I didn't want you doing anything you weren't comfortable with.
Agent Romanoff is comfortable with everything.
I can't lead a mission when the people I'm leading have missions of their own.
It's called companmentalisation.
Nobody spills the secrets, because nobody knows them all.
Except you.
You're wrong about me.
I do share.
I'm nice like that.
Insight bay.
Captain Rogers does not have clearance for Project Insight.
Director override.
Fury, Nicholas J.
Confirmed.
You know, they used to play music.
Yeah.
My grandfather operated one of these things for 40 years.
Granddad worked in a nice building.
Got good tips.
He'd walk home every night, a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.
He'd say, "Hi."
People would say, "Hi" back.
Time went on, the neighbourhood got rougher.
He'd say, "Hi."
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."
Granddad got to gripping that lunch bag a little tighter.
Did he ever get mugged?
Every week some punk would say, "What's in the bag?"
What would he do?
He'd show them.
Bunch of crumpled ones, and a loaded .22
Yeah, Granddad loved people.
But he didn't trust them very much.
Yeah, I know.
They're a little bit bigger than a .22.
This is Project Insight.
Three next-generation helicarriers synced to a network of targeting satellites.
Launched from the Lemurian Star.
Once we get them in the air, they never need to come down.
Continuous sub-orbital flight, courtesy of our new repulsor engines.
Stark?
He had a few suggestions once he got an up-close look at our old turbines.
These new long-range precision guns can eliminate 1,000 hostiles a minute.
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA before he steps outside his spider hole.
We're gonna neutralise a lot of threats before they even happen.
Thought the punishment usually came after the crime.
We can't afford to wait that long.
Who's "We"?
After New York, I convinced the World Security Council we needed a quantum surge in threat analysis.
For once, we're way ahead of the curve.
By holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection.
You know, I read those SSR files.
"Greatest Generation"?
You guys did some nasty stuff.
Yeah, we compromised.
Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well.
But we did it so that people could be free.
This isn't freedom.
This is fear.
S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be.
And it's getting damn near past time for you to get with that programme, Cap.
Don't hold your breath.
A symbol to the nation.
A hero to the world.
The story of Captain America is one of honour, bravery and sacrifice.
Denied enlistment due to poor hearth,
Steven Rogers was chosen for a programme unique in the annals of American warfare.
One that would transform him into the world's first Super-Soldier.
Battle tested,
Captain America and his Howling Commandos quickly earned their stripes.
taking down HYDRA, the Nazi rogue science division.
Best friends since childhood,
Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers were inseparable on both schoolyard and battlefield.
Barnes is the only Howling Commando to give his life in service of his country.
That was a difficult winter.
A blizzard had trapped half our battalion behind the German line.
Steve, Captain Rogers, he fought his way through a HYDRA blockade that had pinned our allies down for months.
He saved aver 1,000 men.
Including the man who would...
Who would become my husband, as it turned out.
Even after he died, Steve was still changing my fife.
You should be proud of yourself, Peggy.
I have lived a life.
My only regret is that you didn't get to live yours.
What is it?
For as long as I can remember, I just wanted to do what was right.
I guess I'm not quite sure what that is any more.
And I thought I could throw myself back in and follow orders.
Serve.
It's just not the same.
You're always so dramatic.
Look, you saved the world.
We rather mucked it up.
You didn't.
Knowing that you helped found S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay.
Hey!
The world has changed, and none of us can go back.
All we can do is our best.
And sometimes the best that we can do is to start over.
Peggy.
Steve.
Yeah?
You're alive.
You came back.
Yeah, Peggy-
It's been so long.
So long.
Well, I couldn't leave my best girl.
Not when she owes me a dance.
Secure office.
Open Lemurian Star's satellite launch file.
Access denied.
Run decryption.
Decryption failed.
Director override.
Fury' Nicholas J.
Override denied.
Ail files seated.
On whose authority?
Fury, Nicholas J.
World Security Council.
Confirmed.
If Nick Fury thinks he can get his costumed thugs and S.T.R.l.K.E. commandos to mop up his mess, he's sadly mistaken.
This failure is unacceptable.
Considering this attack took place one mile from my country's sovereign waters, it's a bit more than that.
I move for immediate hearing.
We don't need hearings, we need action.
It's this Council's duty to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.
A breach like this raises serious questions.
Like how the hell did a French pirate manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel in broad daylight?
For the record, Councilman, he's Algerian.
I can draw a map if it'd help.
I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce.
But this Council takes things like international piracy fairly seriously.
Really?
I don't.
I don't care about one boat, I care about the fleet.
If this Council is going to fall to rancour every time someone pushes us on the playing field,
maybe we need someone to oversee us.
Mr Secretary, nobody is suggesting...
Excuse me.
More trouble, Mr Secretary?
Depends on your definition.
I work 40 floors away and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?
A nuclear war would do it, too.
You busy in there?
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.
I'm hereto ask a favour.
I want you to call for a vote.
Project Insight has to be delayed.
Nick, that's not a favour, that's a sub-committee hearing.
It probably is nothing. I just need time to make sure it's nothing.
But if it's something?
Then we'll both be damn glad those helicarriers aren't in the air.
Fine.
But you got to get Iron Man to stop by my niece's birthday party.
Thank you, sir.
And not just a flyby. He's got to mingle.
The thing is,
I think it's getting worse.
A cop pulled me over last week.
He thought I was drunk.
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.
I thought it was an IED.
Some stuff you leave there.
Other stuff you bring back.
It's our job to figure out how to carry it.
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase, or in a little man-purse?
It's up to you.
Look who it is, the running man.
Caught the last few minutes.
It's pretty intense.
Yeah, brother, we all got the same problems.
Guilt, regret.
You lose someone?
My wingman, Riley.
Flying a night mission.
Standard PJ rescue op.
Nothing we hadn't done 1,000 times before.
Until an RPG knocked Riley's dumb ass out of the sky.
Nothing I could do.
It's like I was up there just to watch.
- I'm sorry.
- After that,
I had a really hard time finding a reason for being over there, you know?
But you're happy now, back in the world?
The number of people giving me orders is down to about zero.
So, hell yeah.
Are you thinking about getting out?
No.
I don't know.
To be honest, I don't know what I would do with myself if I did.
Ultimate fighting?
Just a great idea off the top of my head.
Seriously, you could do whatever you want to do.
What makes you happy?
I don't know.
Activating communications encryption protocol.
Open secure line 0405.
Confirmed.
This is Hill.
I need you here in D.C.
Deep shadow conditions.
Give me four hours.
You have three.

Calculating route to secure location.
My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac.
Hey, if you want...
If you want, you're welcome to use my machine.
Might be cheaper than the one in the basement.
Oh, yeah?
What's it cost?
A cup of coffee?
Thank you, but
I already have a load in downstairs, and you really don't want my scrubs in your machine.
I just finished a rotation in the infectious disease ward, so...
Well, I'll keep my distance.
Hopefully, not too far.
Oh, and I think you left your stereo on.
Oh. Right.
Thank you.
I don't remember giving you a key.
You really think I'd need one?
My wife kicked me out.
I didn't know you were married.
A lot of things you don't know about me.
I know, Nick.
That's the problem.
I'm sorry to have to do this, but I had no place else to crash.
Who else knows about your wife?
Just...
My friends.
Is that what we are?
That's up to you.
Don't trust anyone.
Captain Rogers?
Captain,
I'm Agent 13 of S.H.I.E.L.D. Special Service.
Kate?
I'm assigned to protect you.
On whose order'?
His.
Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive. I need EMTs.
Do we have a 20 on the shooter?
Tell him I'm in pursuit.
Is he gonna make it?
I don't know.
Tell me about the shooter.
He's fast.
Strong.
Had a metal arm.
Ballistics?
Three slugs, no rifling. Completely untraceable.
Soviet-made.
Yeah.
I want you to charge him at 100. Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me.
What's the time?
1:03, Doctor.
Time of death, 1:03 a.m.
I need to take him.
Natasha.
Natasha!
Why was Fury in your apartment?
I don't know.
Cap, they want you back at S.H.I.E.L.D.
Yeah, give me a second.
They want you now.
Okay.
You're a terrible liar.
S.T.R.I.K.E. team, escort Captain Rogers back to S.H.I.E.L.D. immediately for questioning.
I told him.
- Let's go.
- Yeah.
S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out.
Captain Rogers.
Neighbour.
Oh. Captain.
I'm Alexander Pierce.
Sir, it's an honour.
The honour's mine, Captain.
My father served in the 101st.
Come on in.
That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met, when I was at State Department in Bogota.
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy, and security got me out, but the rebels took hostages.
Nick was Deputy Chief of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there, and he comes to me with a plan.
He wants to storm the building through the sewers.
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate, so they put out a kill order.
They stormed the basement, and what do they find? They find it empty.
Nick had ignored my direct order, and carried out an unauthorised military operation on foreign soil, and saved the lives of a dozen political officers, including my daughter.
So you gave him a promotion.
I've never had any cause to regret it.
Captain, why was Nick in your apartment last night?
I don't know.
Did you know it was bugged?
I did, because Nick told me.
Did he tell you he was the one who bugged it?
I want you to see something.
Who hired you, Batroc?
Is that live?
Yeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.
Are you saying he's a suspect?
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.
No, no.
It's more complicated than that.
Batroc was hired anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star.
And he was contacted by email and paid by wire transfer, and then the money was run through 17 fictitious accounts.
The last one going to a holding company that was registered to a Jacob Veech.
Am I supposed to know who that is?
Not likely.
Veech died six years ago.
His last address was 1435 Elmhurst Drive.
When I first met Nick, his mother lived at 1437.
Are you saying Fury hired the pirates?
Why?
The prevailing theory was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence.
The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.
If you really knew Nick Fury, you'd know that's not true.
Why do you think we're talking?
See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to, but because Nick asked me to, because we were both realists.
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric, to build a really better world sometimes means having to tear the old one down.
And that makes enemies.
Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better.
And the idea that those people could be happy today makes me really, really angry.
Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive.
I don't think that's an accident.
And I don't think you do, either.
So, I'm gonna ask again.
Why was he there?
He told me not to trust anyone.
I wonder if that included him.
I'm sorry.
Those were his last words.
Excuse me.
Captain, somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why.
Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it.
Anyone.
Understood.
Operations Control.
Confirmed.
Keep all S.T.R.I.K.E. personnel on site.
- Understood.
- Yes, sir. - Forensics.
- Confirmed.
Cap.
Rumlow.
Evidence Response found some fibres on the roof they want us to see.
You want me to get the tac team ready?
No, let's wait and see what it is first.
Right.
- Administrations level.
- Confirmed.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry about what happened with Fury.
It's messed up, what happened to him.
Thank you.
Records.
Confirmed.
Before we get started, does anyone want to get out?
Mobilise S.T.R.l.K.E. units, 25th floor.
Whoa, big guy-
I just want you to know, Cap, this isn't personal!
It kind of feels personal.
Drop the shield and put your hands in the air!
Give it up, Rogers!
Get that door open!
You have nowhere to go!
Are you kidding me?
He's headed for the garage.
Lock down the bridge.
Stand down, Captain Rogers.
Stand down.
Repeat, stand down.
Eyes here.
Whatever your op is, bury it.
This is Level One.
Contact DOT.
All traffic lights in the district go red.
Shut all runways at BWI,
IAD and Reagan.
All security cameras in the city go through this monitor right here.
Scan all open sources, phones, computers,
PDAs.
Whatever.
If someone tweets about this guy,
I want to know about it.
With all due respect, if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting a manhunt for Captain America we deserve to know why.
Because he lied to us.
Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury.
He refused to share it.
As difficult as this is to accept,
Captain America is a fugitive from S.H.I.E.L.D.
- Where is it?
- Safe. - Do better.
- Where did you get it?
Why would I tell you?
Fury gave it to you.
Why?
- What's on it?
- I don't know.
Stop lying-
I only act like I know everything, Rogers.
I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?
Well, it makes sense.
The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
I know who killed Fury.
Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists.
The ones that do call him the Winter Soldier.
He's credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last 50 years.
So he's a ghost story.
Five years ago, I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran.
Somebody shot out my tyres near Odessa.
We lost control, went straight over a cliff.
I pulled us out.
But the Winter Soldier was there.
I was covering my engineer so he shot him straight through me.
Soviet slug.
No rifling.
Bye-bye, bikinis.
Yeah, I bet you look terrible in them now.
Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.
Like you said, he's a ghost story.
Well, let's find out what the ghost wants.
Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood.
To any reasonable person, that would make him a martyr, not a traitor.
You know what makes him a traitor?
Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship.
Nick Fury used your friendship to coerce this Council into delaying Project Insight.
A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations.
At best, he lied to you. At worst...
Are you calling for my resignation?
I've got a pen and paper right here.
That discussion can be tabled for a later time.
But you do want to have a discussion?
We've already had it, Mr Secretary.
This Council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight.
If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.
First rule of going on the run is don't run, walk.
If I run in these shoes, they're gonna fall off.
The drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up
S.H.I.E.L.D. will know exactly where we are.
How much time will we have?
About nine minutes from now.
Fury was right about that ship.
Somebody's trying to hide something.
This drive is protected by some sort of Al.
It keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.
Can you override it?
The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me.
Slightly.
I'm gonna try running a tracer.
This is a program that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed to track hostile malware, so if we can't read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from.
Can I help you guys with anything?
Oh, no. My fiancé was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations.
Right.
We're getting married.
Congratulations.
Where are you guys thinking about going?
- New Jersey. - Oh.
I have the exact same glasses.
Wow, you two are practically twins.
Yeah, I wish.
Specimen.
If you guys need anything, I've been Aaron.
Thank you.
- You said nine minutes.
Come on. - Relax.
Got it.
You know it?
I used to.
Let's go.
Standard tac team.
Two behind, two across, and two coming straight at us.
If they make us, I'll engage, you hit the south escalator to the metro.
Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.
- What?
- Do it.
Negative at the source.
Give me a floor rundown.
Negative on three.
Negative on two.
Snake the upper levels. Work down to me.
- Kiss me.
What? Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable.
Yes, they do.
You still uncomfortable?
It's not exactly the word I would use.
Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car?
- Nazi Germany. - Mmm.
And we're borrowing.
Take your feet off the dash.
All right, I have a question for you, which you do not have to answer.
I feel like, if you don't answer it though,
- you're kind of answering it, you know.
What? Was that your first kiss since 1945?
- That bad, huh?
- I didn't say that.
Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.
No, I didn't.
I just wondered how much practice you've had.
- You don't need practice.
- Everybody needs practice.
It was not my first kiss since 1945.
I'm 95, I'm not dead.
Nobody special, though?
Believe it or not, it's kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience.
Well, that's all right. You just make something up.
- What, like you?
- I don't know.
The truth is a matter of circumstance.
It's not all things to all people, all the time.
Neither am I.
That's a tough way to live.
It's a good way not to die, though.
You know, it's kind of hard to trust someone, when you don't know who that someone really is.
Yeah.
Who do you want me to be?
How about a friend?
Well, there's a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers.
This is it.
The file came from these coordinates.
So did I.
This camp is where I was trained.
Change much?
A little.
Pick up the pace, ladies!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Double time!
Come on, Rogers, move it!
Come on, fall in!
Rogers!
I said fall in!
This is a dead end.
Zero heat signatures, zero waves, not even radio.
Whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off.
What is it?
Army regulations forbid storing munitions within 500 yards of the barracks.
This building is in the wrong place.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.
Maybe where it started.
And there's Stark's father.
Howard.
Who's the girl?
If you're already working in a secret office,
why do you need to hide the elevator?
This can't be the data point.
This technology is ancient.
Y-E-S spells yes.
Shall we play a game?
- It's from a movie that was really...
- I know, I saw it.
Rogers, Steven, born 1918.
Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna, born 1984.
It's some kind of recording.
I am not a recording, Fräulein.
I may not be the man I was when the Captain took me prisoner in 1945.
But I am.
You know this thing?
Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull.
He's been dead for years.
Firs! correction, I am Swiss.
Second, look around you.
I have never been more alive.
In 1972, I received a terminal diagnosis.
Science could not save my body.
My mind, however, that was worth saving, on 200,000 feet of databanks.
You are standing in my brain.
- How did you get here?
- Invited.
It was Operation Paperclip after World War ll.
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited German scientists with strategic value.
They thought I could help their cause.
I also helped my own.
HYDRA died with the Red Skull.
Cut off one head, two more shall take its place.
Prove it.
Accessing archive.
HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom.
What we did not realise was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist.
The war taught us much.
Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly.
After the war, S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded, and I was recruited.
The new HYDRA grew.
A beautiful parasite inside S.H.I.E.L.D.
For 70 years,
HYDRA has been secretly feeding crisis, reaping war, and when history did not cooperate, history was changed.
That's impossible.
S.H.I.E.L.D. would have stopped you.
Accidents will happen.
HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security.
Once a purification process is complete,
HYDRA's new world order will arise.
We won, Captain.
Your death amounts to the same as your life.
A zero sum.
As I was saying...
What's on this drive?
Project Insight requires insight.
So, I wrote an algorithm.
What kind of algorithm?
What does it do?
The answer to your question is fascinating.
Unfortunately, you shall be too dead to hear it.
Steve, we got a bogey.
Short range ballistic.
- 30 seconds tops.
- Who fired it?
S.H.I.E.L.D.
I am afraid I have been stalling, Captain.
Admit it.
It's better this way.
We are, both of us, out of time.
Call in the asset.
I'm going to go, Mr Pierce.
You need anything before I leave?
No...
Uh, it's fine, Renata, you can go home.
Okay.
Night-night.
Good night.
Want some milk?
The timetable has moved.
Our window is limited.
Two targets, Level Six.
They already cost me Zola.
I want confirmed death in 10 hours.
Sorry, Mr Pierce, I...
I forgot my phone.
Oh, Renata, I wish you would have knocked.
Hey, man.
I'm sorry about this.
We need a place to lay low.
Everyone we know is trying 10 kill us.
Not everyone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
What's going on?
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D. I thought I was going straight.
But I guess I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA.
I thought I knew whose lies I was telling,
but I guess I can't tell the difference any more.
There's a chance you might be in the wrong business.
I owe you.
It's okay.
If it was the other way around, and it was down to me to save your life, now you be honest with me,
would you trust me to do it?
I would now.
And I'm always honest.
Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing.
Well, guess I just like to know who I'm fighting.
I made breakfast.
If you guys eat that son of thing.
So, the question is, who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch a domestic missile strike?
Pierce.
Who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world.
But he's not working alone.
Zola's algorithm was on the Lemurian Star.
So was Jasper Sitwell.
So, the real question is, how do the two most wanted people in Washington kidnap a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight?
The answer is, you don't.
- What's this?
- Call it a résumé.
Is this Bakhmala?
The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you?
You didn't say he was a Pararescue.
- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.
I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs.
What did you use?
A stealth chute?
No.
These.
I thought you said you were a pilot.
I never said pilot.
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.
You got out for a good reason.
Dude, Captain America needs my help.
There's no better reason to get back in.
Where can we get our hands on one of these things?
The last one is at Fort Meade.
Behind three guarded gates and a 12-inch steel wall.
Shouldn't be a problem.
Listen, I got to fly home tonight because I got some constituency problem and I got to press the flesh.
Any constituent in particular, Mr Senator'?
Oh, no, not really.
Twenty-three, kind of hot.
Real hot, you know?
Wants to be a reporter, I think. I don't know.
Who listens at that point?
Doesn't sound like much of a problem to me.
Really?
Because she's killing my back.
But this isn't the place to talk about it.
This is a nice pin.
- Thank you.
- Come here.
Hail HYDRA.
I need a minute.
Bring the car around.
YES, sir?
Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?
I hear the crab cakes here are delicious.
Who is this?
The good-looking guy in the sunglasses, your 10 o'clock.
Your other 10 o' clock.
There you go.
What do you want?
You're gonna go around the comer to your right.
There's a grey car two spaces down.
You and I are gonna take a ride.
And why would I do that?
Because that tie looks really expensive, and I'd hate to mess it up.
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.
Never heard of it.
What were you doing on the Lemurian Star?
I was throwing up.
I get seasick.
Is this little display meant to insinuate that you're gonna throw me off the roof?
Because it's really not your style, Rogers.
You're right.
It's not.
It's hers.
Oh, wait. What about that girl from Accounting, Laura...
Lillian.
Lip piercing, right?
Yeah, she's cute.
Yeah.
I'm not ready for that.
Zola's algorithm is a program for choosing
- insight's targets.
- What targets?
You!
A TV anchor in Cairo, the Under Secretary of Defence, a high school valedictorian in Iowa City,
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, anyone who's a threat to HYDRA.
Now, or in the future.
In the future?
How could it know?
How could it not?
The 21st century is a digital book.
Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.
Your bank records, medical histories, voting patterns, emails, phone calls, your damn SAT scores!
Zola's algorithm evaluates people's past to predict their future.
And what then?
Oh, my God.
Pierce is gonna kill me.
What then?
Then the Insight helicarriers scratch people off the list.
A few million at a time.
HYDRA doesn't like leaks.
Then why don't you try sticking a cork in it'?
Insight's launching in 16 hours.
We're cutting it a little bit close here.
I know.
We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans and access the helicarriers directly.
What?
Are you crazy?
That is a terrible, terrible idea.
Shit!
Hang on!
I have her.
Find him.
Go!
I got this!
Taking fire above and below expressway. Civilians threatened.
Repeat, civilians threatened.
I make an LZ, 2300 block of Virginia Avenue.
Rendezvous, two minutes.
Get out of the way!
Stay out of the way!
Bucky?
Who the hell is Bucky?
Drop the shield, Cap!
Get on your knees!
Get on your knees!
Get down, get down!
Get on your knees!
Down!
Don't move.
Put the gun down.
Not here.
Not here!
It was him.
He looked right at me like he didn't even know me.
How is that even possible?
It was, like, 70 years ago.
Zola.
Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43.
Zola experimented on him.
Whatever he did helped Bucky survive the fall.
They must have found him and...
None of that's your fault, Steve.
Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.
We need to get a doctor here.
If we don't put pressure on that wound, she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.
Ah. That thing was squeezing my brain.
Who is this guy?
Three holes. Stan digging.
GSW. She's lost at least a pint. Maybe two.
- Let me take her.
- She'll want to see him first.
About damn time.
Lacerated spinal column, cracked sternum, shattered collarbone, perforated liver, and one hell of a headache.
Don't forget your collapsed lung.
Let's not forget that.
Otherwise, I'm good.
They cut you open. Your heart stopped.
Tetrodotoxin B.
Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.
Banner developed it for stress.
Didn't work so great for him, but we found a use for it.
Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?
Any attempt on the Director's life had to look successful.
Can't kill you if you're already dead.
Besides,
I wasn't sure who to trust.
Sergeant Barnes.
Bucky, no!
The procedure has already started.
You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.
Put him on ice.
Sir.
He's unstable.
Erratic.
Mission report.
Mission report now.
The man on the bridge.
Who was he?
You met him earlier this week on another assignment.
I knew him.
Your work has been a gift to mankind.
You shaped the century.
And I need you to do it one more time.
Society's at a tipping point between order and chaos.
And tomorrow morning, we're gonna give it a push.
But, if you don't do your part, I can't do mine.
And HYDRA can't give the world the freedom it deserves.
But I knew him.
Prep him.
He's been out of cryo freeze too long.
Then wipe him and start over.
This man declined the Nobel Peace Prize.
He said peace wasn't an achievement, it was a responsibility.
See, it's stuff like this that gives me trust issues.
We have to stop the launch.
I don't think the Council's accepting my calls any more.
What's that?
Once the helicarriers reach 3,000 feet, they'll triangulate with Insight satellites, becoming fully weaponised.
We need to breach those carriers and replace their targeting blades with our own.
One or two won't cut it.
We need lo link all three carriers for this to work, because if even one of those ships remains operational, a whole lot of people are gonna die.
We have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is HYDRA.
We have to get past them, insert these server blades.
And maybe, just maybe we can salvage what's left...
We're not salvaging anything.
We're not just taking down the carriers, Nick.
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.
S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing to do with this.
You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.
HYDRA grew right under your nose and nobody noticed.
Why do you think we're meeting in this cave?
I noticed.
How many paid the price before you did?
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.
Even if you had, would you have told me?
Or would you have compartmentalised that, too?
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA, it all goes.
He's right.
Don't look at me.
I do what he does, just slower.
Well...
It looks like you're giving the orders now, Captain.
We looked for you, after.
My folks wanted to give you a ride to the cemetery.
I know, I'm sorry.
I just kind of wanted to be alone.
How was it?
It was okay.
She's next to Dad.
I was gonna ask...
I know what you're gonna say, Buck.
We can put the couch cushions on the floor like when we were kids.
All you got to do is shine my shoes, maybe take out the trash.
Come on.
Thank you, Buck, but I can get by on my own.
The thing is, you don't have to.
I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.
He's gonna be there, you know.
I know.
Look, whoever he used to be and the guy he is now,
I don't think he's the kind you save.
He's the kind you stop.
I don't know if I can do that.
Well, he might not give you a choice.
He doesn't know you.
He will.
Gear up.
It's time.
You gonna wear that?
No.
If you're gonna fight a war, you got to wear a uniform.
Oh, man.
I am so fired.
We are in final launch sequence.
We are go on guidance.
And how was your flight?
Lovely.
The ride from the airport, less so.
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't control everything.
Including Captain America.
This facility is biometrically controlled.
And these will give you unrestricted access.
Ahh! Must be the dish.
I'll check it out.
Excuse us.
I know the road hasn't exactly been smooth, and some of you would have gladly kicked me out of the car along the way.
Finally, we're here.
And the world should be grateful.
Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, this is Steve Rogers.
You've heard a lot about me over the last few days.
Some of you were even ordered to hunt me down.
But I think it's time you know the truth.
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not what we thought it was.
It's been taken over by HYDRA.
Alexander Pierce is their leader.
The S.T.R.I.K.E. and insight crew are HYDRA as well.
I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building.
They could be standing right next to you.
They almost have what they want.
Absolute control.
They shot Nick Fury.
And it won't end there.
If you launch those helicarriers today,
HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way.
Unless we stop them.
I know I'm asking a lot.
But the price of freedom is high. It always has been.
And it's a price I'm willing to pay.
And if I'm the only one, then so be it.
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.
Did you write that down first, or was it off the top of your head?
You smug son of a bitch.
Arrest him.
I guess I've got the floor.
Preempt the launch sequence.
Send those ships up now.
Is there a problem?
Um... ls there a problem?
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not gonna launch those ships.
Captain's orders.
Move away from your station.
Like he said...
Put the gun down! Captain's orders.
You picked the wrong side, Agent.
Depends on where you're standing.
Close the bay door!
Close the bay door now!
Close the bay door!
They're initiating launch.
Hey, Cap, how do we know the good guys from the bad guys?
If they're shooting at you, they're bad.
Hey, Cap,
I found those bad guys you were talking about.
You okay?
I'm not dead yet.
Let me ask you a question.
What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow and you knew that they were going to drag your daughters into a soccer stadium for execution,
and you could just stop it, with a flick of the switch.
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you all?
Not if it was your switch.
I'm sorry.
Did I step on your moment?
Satellites in range at 3,000 feet.
Falcon, status?
Engaging-
All right, Cap.
I'm in.
Oh, Shit.
Eight minutes, Cap.
Working on it.
What are you doing?
She's disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets onto the Internet.
- Including HYDRA'S.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.
If you do this, none of your past is gonna remain hidden.
Are you sure you're ready for the world to see you as you really are?
Are you?
Alpha lock.
Falcon, where are you now'?
I had to take a detour.
I'm in.
Bravo lock.
Two down, one to go.
All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble.
We're the only air support Captain Rogers has got.
Disabling the encryption is an executive order.
It takes two Alpha Level members.
Don't worry.
Company's coming.
Did you get my flowers?
- I'm glad you're here, Nick.
- Really?
Because I thought you had me killed.
You know how the game works.
So why make me head of S.H.I.E.L.D.'?
Because you were the best, and the most ruthless person I ever met.
I did what I did to protect people.
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.
Disorder.
War.
It's just a matter of time before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow, or an EMP fries Chicago.
Diplomacy?
A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.
And you know where I learned that.
Bogota.
You didn't ask. You just did what had to be done.
I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people by sacrificing 20 million.
It's the next step, Nick.
If you have the courage to take it.
No. I have the courage not to.
Retinal scanner active.
You don't think we've wiped your clearance from the system?
I know you erased my password.
Probably deleted my retinal scan.
But if you want to stay ahead of me, Mr Secretary,
you need to keep both eyes open.
Alpha level confirmed.
Encryption code accepted.
Safeguards removed.
Charlie carrier is 45 degrees off the port bow.
Six minutes.
Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride.
Roger. Let me know when you're ready.
I just did!
You know, you're a lot heavier than you look.
I had a big breakfast.
Steve!
Cap!
Cap, come in. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm here.
I'm still on the helicarrier.
- Where are you?
- I'm grounded.
The suit's down.
Sorry, Cap.
Don't worry.
I got it.
Sir, the Council's been breached.
- Repeat, Dispatch.
- Black widow's up there.
Headed up.
- Falcon?
- Yeah. Rumlow's headed for the Council.
I'm on it.
People are gonna die, Buck.
I can't let that happen.
Please don't make me do this.
Done.
And it's trending.
Unless you want a two-inch hole in your sternum, I'd put that gun down.
That was armed the moment you pinned it on.
Drop it!
Drop it!
I'm on 41, headed toward the southwest stairwell.
This is gonna hurt.
There are no prisoners with HYDRA. Just order.
And order only comes through pain.
- You ready for yours?
- Man, shut the hell up.
Lieutenant, how much longer?
65 seconds to satellite link.
Targeting grid engaged.
Lowering weapons array now.
One minute.
30 seconds, Cap.
Stand by.
Charlie...
We've reached 3,000 feet.
Sat link coming online now.
Deploy algorithm.
Algorithm deployed.
We are go to target.
Target saturation reached. All targets assigned.
Fire when ready.
Firing in...
Three, two.
One.
Charlie lock.
Where are the targets?
Where are the targets?
Okay, Cap, get out of there.
Fire now.
- But, Steve...
- Do it!
Do it now!
What a waste.
So, you still on the fence about Rogers' chances?
Time to go, Councilwoman.
This way.
Come on.
You're going to fly me out of here.
You know, there was a time I would've taken a bullet for you.
You already did.
You will again, when it's useful.
Romanoff.
Natasha.
Natasha!
Come on!
Those really do sting.
Hail HYDRA.
You're out of your depth, kid.
Please tell me you got that chopper in the air!
Sam, where are you?
41st floor! Northwest corner!
We're on it!
Stay where you are!
Not an option!
41st floor!
41st!
It's not like they put the floor numbers on the outside of the building.
Hill!
Where's Steve?
You got a location on Rogers?
You know me.
No, I don't!
Bucky.
You've known me your whole life.
Your name is James Buchanan Barnes.
Shut up!
I'm not gonna fight you.
You're my friend.
You're my mission.
You're my mission!
Then finish it.
Because I'm with you to the end of the line.
On your left.
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Why haven't we yet heard from Captain Rogers?
I don't know what there is left for him to say.
I think the wreck in the middle of the Potomac made his point fairly eloquently.
Well, he could explain how this country is expected to maintain its national security now that he and you have laid waste to our intelligence apparatus.
HYDRA was selling you lies, not intelligence.
Many of which you seemed to have had a personal hand in telling.
Agent, you should know that there are some on this committee who feel, given your service record, both for this country and against it, that you belong in a penitentiary.
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.
You're not going to put me in a prison.
You're not going to put any of us in a prison.
You know why?
Do enlighten us.
Because you need us.
Yes, the world is a vulnerable place, and yes, we help make it that way.
But we're also the ones best qualified to defend it.
So, if you want to arrest me, arrest me.
You'll know where to find me.
So, you've experienced this sort of thing before.
You get used to it.
We've been data mining HYDRA'S files.
Looks like a lot of rats didn't go down with the ship.
I'm headed to Europe tonight.
Wanted to ask if you'd come.
There's something I got to do first.
How about you, Wilson?
Could use a man with your abilities.
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.
All right, then.
Anybody asks for me, tell them they can find me, right here.
That's about as close as he gets to saying thank you.
Not going with him?
No.
- Not staying here.
- Nah.
I blew all my covers. I got to go figure out a new one.
That might take a while.
I'm counting on it.
That thing you asked for,
I called in a few favours from Kiev.
Will you do me a favour'?
Call that nurse.
She's not a nurse.
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.
She's nice.
Be careful, Steve.
You might not want to pull on that thread.
You're going after him.
You don't have to come with me.
I know.
When do we start?
It's over.
Fury has released everything to the public.
Everything he knows about.
Herr Strucker, if they get word of our work here, if they find out we serve HYDRA...
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.
Two sides of a coin that's no longer currency.
What we have is worth more than any of them ever knew.
We've only scratched the surface and already, there are other facilities doing HYDRA's good work around the world.
We'll feed them to Captain America and his colourful friends, and keep them off our scent.
What about the volunteers?
The dead will be buried so deep their own ghosts won't be able to find them.
And the survivors?
The twins.
Sooner or later, they will meet the twins.
It's not a world of spies any more.
Not even a world of heroes.
This is the age of miracles, Doctor.
There's nothing more horrifying than a miracle.
LAMECH: From Adam to Seth, from Seth to Enosh,
Enosh to Kenan, Kenan to Mahalalel to my father, Methuselah, then to me.
Today, that birthright passes to you,
Noah.
My son.
The Creator made Adam in His image, and then placed the world in his care.
This is your work now.
Your responsibility.
May you walk alongside The Creator in righteousness.
So I say to you...
YOUNG TUBAL-CAIN: The Shrine of Seth!
Men.
Hide.
YOUNG TUBAL-CAIN: We mine here.
The ground is rich with tzohar.
This is The Creator's land.
What are you doing?
YOUNG TUBAL-CAIN: The Creator?
My mines run dry.
My city withers and must be fed.
And what has He done?
He cursed us to struggle by the sweat of our brow to survive!
Damned if I don't do everything it takes to do just that.
Damned if I don't take what I want.
This relic belongs to the descendants of Cain now.
The line of Seth ends here.
It is ours.
Now dig!
NOAH:
What are you doing?
It's pretty.
You see those other flowers?
How they're attached to the ground?
That's where they should be.
They have a purpose.
They sprout.
And they bloom.
The wind takes their seeds and more flowers grow.
We only collect what we can use, and what we need.
Do you understand?
Shem.
Ham.
Let's go.
Men.
Hide, hide.
Go.
POACHER: You found our kill.
(GASPS) How fortunate.
But for you... maybe not.
You know how long it is since we ate meat?
Since we even saw an animal?
Easy.
Please.
What do you want?
Justice.
Why did they kill it?
They eat them.
Why?
They think it makes them stronger.
Is it true?
They forget strength comes from The Creator.
YOUNG SHEM: Mama!
Mommy!
(WHISPERING) See your brothers?
Ham saw men hunting today.
They are getting closer.
How was he?
A little too interested.
He had to see it sometime.
I saw something else.
A flower bloom from nothing.
Rest.
Perhaps He will finally make things right.
Methuselah.
NAAMEH: Did He speak to you?
NOAH: I think so.
NAAMEH: Will He help us?
He's going to destroy the world.
NAAMEH: It's a long and dangerous journey for the boys. (BABY COOING)
How do you know your grandfather's still alive?
I don't.
I saw his mountain.
We need to go and find out if he knows what we're to do.
YOUNG HAM:
Shem. Can you help me with this?
We could take the boys and find a place to hide.
There'll be no hiding.
We should have left already.
NOAH: Ham, let me show you how to do that.
Push it in here.
Next time we come through, we'll know we've got certain things we might need.
NAAMEH: There are cities ahead.
NOAH: We will not get too close.
YOUNG HAM: Is that a tzohar mine?
NOAH: It was once.
Before they dug it all up.
Should we go around?
No.
Do you think they're all dead?
It looks that way.
They must have been scavenging here.
And someone scavenged from them.
GIRL: Dada!
Stay close.
YOUNG SHEM: Father!
Here!
(GIRL BREATHING HEAVILY)
Let me see.
Tell me your name.
You have a name?
Ila.
My name is Ila.
NAAMEH: Ila.
You're going to be all right, Ila.
(CONTINUES BREATHING HEAVILY) This is Shem.
He's going to hold your hand tight and he won't let go.
MAN: Up the hill!
Hurry!
Hurry!
We have to go.
Now.
NOAH: Up the hill.
Run.
NAAMEH: We can't go there. (SHOUTING CONTINUES)
NOAH: We have no choice.
Hurry!
MAN 1:
- Hold, men!
Hold! MAN 2: - The giants!
MAN 3: They'll kill you!
NOAH: Shem!
Protect your mother, first and last.
I love you.
Run!
NAAMEH: (SCREAMING) Noah!
NAAMEH: Noah!
Noah.
Noah.
Are you all right?
We are to see Methuselah.
My grandfather.
A child of the old one?
You should have killed them.
OG: - But, Samyaza...
- This is a man, Og.
Do you forget how they betrayed The Creator?
It is He who sends us!
(GROWLS) SAMYAZA: It lies!
Leave them here to rot.
What are they?
The Watchers.
YOUNG ILA: Dada?
Sleep now.
Sing to me.
I want my daddy to sing to me.
You know, I, too, lost my father when I was very young.
There's a song he used to sing me sometimes when I couldn't sleep.
Would you like to hear it?
NAAMEH: It's an ugly wound.
She'll never have children.
If the fever doesn't take her, I think she'll live.
(WHISPERING) Follow me.
I'm sorry I frightened you.
Watchers have learned to fear men.
YOUNG HAM: Then why are you helping us?
The Creator formed us on the second day.
The day He made the heavens.
We watched over Adam and Eve.
Saw their frailty and their love.
And then we saw their fall.
And we pitied them.
We were not stone then, but light.
It was not our place to interfere.
Yet we chose to try and help mankind.
And when we disobeyed The Creator,
He punished us.
We were encrusted by your world.
Rock and mud shackled our fiery glow.
Still, we taught mankind all we knew of Creation.
With our help they rose from the dust, became great and mighty.
But then they turned our gifts to violence.
Only one man protected us.
Your grandfather Methuselah.
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING)
We were hunted.
Most of us killed.
Those who lived were left prisoners in these stony shells, marooned upon this barren land.
We begged The Creator to take us home.
But He was always silent.
And now you claim that you have heard His call.
Samyaza cannot accept this.
A man?
When it is men who broke the world.
But I look at you and I see a glimmer of Adam again.
The man I knew.
The man I came to help.
YOUNG HAM: Why can't I come?
Because I need you to look after Mother.
Do you understand?
(WHISPERING) And you look after your father.
Watch over them.
They are in good hands.
Grandfather?
METHUSELAH: Noah.
This is your great-grandfather.
Show him respect.
Tell him your name.
I am Shem.
My eldest.
Come closer.
Let me see you.
You're a lucky boy.
I think you must have your mother's looks, not your father's.
Come tell me about yourself.
So, what do you like most in the world?
Berries.
- What?
- Berries.
Ah, berries, yes.
What can compete with fresh, ripe berries?
Nothing.
Yes, it's been so long I can barely remember the taste of them.
Ah, tell me, did you bring me any?
No?
I'm craving them now.
Ah, well, perhaps one day.
You must be tired.
It's a long way up here.
Yeah.
Why not rest?
How perfect.
What we need to discuss is not for boys.
You know why I've come?
Yes.
Before he walked on, my father Enoch told me that one day, if man continued in his ways,
The Creator would annihilate this world.
So what I saw is true?
All life blotted out because of what man has done?
Can it not be averted?
Noah, you must trust that He speaks in a way that you can understand.
So you tell me.
Can this destruction be averted?
No.
He sent me here.
Why send me if there's nothing I can do to stop it?
Well, perhaps He simply sends you here to share a cup of tea with an old man.
So, is that all you saw?
The fires of destruction on this place?
No, not fire.
Water.
Water?
Huh. My father said it would be fire.
I saw water.
Death by water.
I saw death.
And I saw new life.
There's something more, Grandfather.
Something I'm to do.
I know it.
I just didn't see what it was.
New life.
Well, perhaps there is more for you to see.
Did He not send you here to drink a cup of tea with an old man?
The medicine always tastes bad.
YOUNG SHEM: She was the only one moving.
METHUSELAH: Was she hurt badly?
YOUNG SHEM: She had a big cut on her belly.
Mother helped and I held her hand.
That must have made her feel safe.
Well?
Fire consumes all.
Water cleanses.
It separates the foul from the pure.
The wicked from the innocent.
And that which sinks from that which rises.
He destroys all, but only to start again.
You sure?
Yes.
The storm cannot be stopped.
But it can be survived.
Yeah.
You may need this.
It's a seed.
From the first Garden.
From Eden.
Remember, Noah,
He chose you for a reason.
YOUNG HAM:
You can't get me! Oh, you can't get me!
Dada!
NOAH: My grandfather lives.
He's helped me see what we're here to do.
Men are going to be punished for what they've done to this world.
There will be destruction.
There will be tragedy.
And our family has been chosen for a great task.
We've been chosen to save the innocent.
The innocent?
The animals.
Why are they innocent?
Because they still live as they did in the Garden.
Yes.
And we need to save enough of them to start again.
But what of us?
I guess we get to start again, too.
We get to start again in a new and better world.
But first we have to build.
Build what?
NOAH: A great flood is coming.
The waters of the heavens will meet the waters of the earth.
We build a vessel to survive the storm.
We build an ark.
SAMYAZA: Take the traitor back.
OG: He is a child of the old one!
(OG GROANING) Stop!
There is work to do.
Help us.
Help you? (GROANS)
We tried to help your kind once.
And we lost everything because of you!
Not everything.
We can save what is left.
We can serve Him again.
You treacherous snake!
The Creator.
NAAMEH: Children!
What is this?
This...
This is our ark.
We will help this man.
No! (LAUGHING)
Shem.
Wait.
Please.
It still hurts?
- Ham!
- Shem!
He doesn't have anyone.
SHEM: Come.
Father, did you see them?
Father?
Yes, Japheth.
It begins.
Ready?
NOAH: It sleeps.
Gently.
See, that's a boy one and that's a girl one.
After the storm, they'll become a mother and a father.
And the hatchlings will spread right across the world.
We have to be gentle with them and we have to be protective.
If something were to happen, that would be a small piece of Creation lost forever.
All of these innocent creatures are now in our care.
It's our job to look after them.
HAM: Father?
All the birds are two.
You have Mother, Shem has Ila.
(SIGHS) But what of me?
What of Japheth?
Who is there for us?
Did you see how He made the forest to give us wood for the ark?
How He sent the birds?
So, hasn't He sent everything we need?
JAPHETH: Mother!
What is it?
What?
Snakes!
- Snakes are coming, too?
- Yeah.
All that creeps, all that crawls, all that slithers.
It's all right.
JAPHETH:
Father! Father!
Don't be afraid.
No one will hurt this boy.
What's your name?
- Ham.
- Ham?
I am Tubal-cain.
Do you know me?
You don't know your king?
My father says there can be no king in The Creator's garden.
Ham, come here.
Do not take my best soldier.
He's nothing of yours.
Look at his hand on that weapon.
I believe he is something of mine.
Ham.
Leave it.
No, he gave it to me.
Do what I tell you.
When I heard talk of miracles, I dismissed them.
But then I saw the birds with my own eyes, flying here, and I had to come.
There isn't anything for you here.
No?
This all belongs to me.
This land.
This forest.
That stronghold of yours.
Did you really think you could protect yourself from me in that?
It's not protection from you.
TUBAL-CAIN: Then what is it?
An ark to hold the innocent when The Creator sends his deluge to wipe out the wicked from this world.
The Creator does not care what happens in this world.
Nobody has heard from Him since He marked Cain.
We are alone.
Orphaned children, cursed to struggle by the sweat of our brow to survive.
Damned if I don't do everything it takes to do just that. (SPITS)
BOTH: Damned if I don't take what I want.
We have met?
I am the son of Lamech!
Eight generations descended from Seth!
Return to your cities of Cain!
Know we have all been judged!
I have men at my back, and you stand alone and defy me?
I'm not alone.
MAN: Take the children!
Do not fear, my people!
Don't be afraid!
Stand! SOLDIER:
His minions, uh, they're with you?
Miracles?
A deluge, you claim?
Well, perhaps you're right.
Perhaps casting us out of Paradise was not enough.
Perhaps, He returns to finish us off.
Well, if He does,
I will ride the storm in that ship of yours.
There is no escape for you and your kind.
Your time is done.
- The land is dying. NOAH:
- Ham.
TUBAL-CAIN: The cities are dead. NOAH:
Don't listen to him.
TUBAL-CAIN: My people follow me!
And more will follow them!
I'm not afraid of miracles, son of Lamech!
If you refuse my dozens now,
I shall return with legions!
TUBAL-CAIN: Move.
Father?
Will so many really come?
We need to finish as fast as we can.
The sooner He sends the rain, the better.
Until then, we're safer inside.
We build.
First weapons, then men.
Feed only those that will fight.
Arm them, train them, and there is nothing they can't do.
With an army, we can crush those giants.
MAN 1: Please, we're hungry!
MAN 2: - Give us meat.
MAN 1: - Our children are starving.
MAN 3: Please help us!
WOMAN: Let us go!
MAN 1: We're starving!
Should I come back?
No.
Do you think those men are going to attack us?
When the rain comes.
What do you think it'll be like?
I've imagined it.
Seeing that much death,
I'm not sure there are words.
The end of everything.
The beginning.
The beginning of everything.
So what is it?
Whatever he's done or said, Shem is very fond of you.
Shem needs a woman.
A real woman.
He should have a family.
I can't give any of that to him.
And I'm not going to deny him those things, even if he wants me to.
I won't do it.
Besides, why would The Creator want a barren girl on His ark?
Ila.
Ila.
When we first took you in,
I thought you were going to be a burden.
And I didn't want to see anybody else ruined by this world.
But I was wrong.
You're a gift.
A precious, precious gift.
Just don't forget how precious a gift you are.
I know you'll be going to find wives for Ham and Japheth.
You should find one for Shem, too.
Ila.
MEAN UNCLE: Where do you think you're going?
WOMAN: Please, please don't take my baby!
Let them go! Please!
Sorry, we have to eat!
Don't take my baby! No!
Don't take my baby!
No, no, please will you stop him?
Let them go!
No!
MEAN UNCLE: Quit struggling!
It'll be easier.
Come with me!
Stop struggling!
You!
You!
MAN: I have two girls!
I have two girls to trade!
Take the girls!
Give me the meat!
Give it to me!
What happened?
NOAH: All of this should be inside by now.
The storm is coming.
What about our wives?
Where are they?
Did you not hear what I just said?
But when are they coming?
There will be no wives.
What?
What?
No!
You said that The Creator would give us what we'll need.
- Help your brother.
- No.
Listen, you can't do this!
You can't.
How am I supposed to be a man?
I said help your brother.
- You want me to stay a child!
- No!
I'm asking you to be a man and do what needs to be done.
ILA: Ham!
Ham!
NAAMEH: What are you doing, Noah?
The wickedness is not just in them.
It's in all of us.
I saw it.
No.
Noah.
There's goodness in us.
Look at our boys.
Shem's loyalty.
Japheth's kindness.
Ham's integrity. Hmm?
Good men.
They'd be good fathers.
Shem is blinded by desire.
Ham is covetous.
And Japheth lives only to please.
I am no better.
And you?
Is there anything you would not do, good or bad, for those three boys?
We would both choose to kill in order to protect our children.
Yes.
We're no different.
We were weak and we were selfish to think we could set ourselves apart.
We will work, complete the task,
and then we'll die.
The same as everyone else.
They are children!
They are our children, Noah!
Have you no mercy?
The time for mercy has passed.
Now our punishment begins.
Ham!
Ham!
Grandfather?
Grandfather?
METHUSELAH:
Did Noah plant the seed I gave him?
Yes.
And in all that forest there were no berries?
Shem promised me berries.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
It's a pity.
Then why did you come here?
It's Noah.
He leaves our boys with no one.
Shem has Ila, but she's barren.
There'll be no other wives, so no children.
Justice.
The Creator destroys this world because we corrupted it.
So we ourselves must be destroyed.
No.
I can't believe that's true.
Not when I look at my sons.
All they desire is love.
Isn't that all their hearts need to be good?
METHUSELAH: Who is good?
Who is wicked?
How am I supposed to know what is right?
That choice is Noah's.
Not mine.
Not yours.
It sounds like he has made it.
So then you will not help me?
I don't know if I even could.
But if I tried, it could cause pain and possibly tragedy.
And in the end, it would just come back to Noah again.
Is that what you wish?
I want my sons to have children.
I want them to be happy.
I can't bear to think of them dying alone.
SOLDIER: Out of the way!
Coming through!
NA'EL:
Get away!
No. No, no...
It's all right.
It's all right.
I'm not...
I'm not going to hurt you.
I have food.
Here.
What do you want?
Nothing.
Are you alone?
Yes.
And you?
I can help you get away.
No.
Well, then, I'll stay a little while.
If that is all right?
My name is Na'el.
NOAH: Shem!
Go and find them and bring them back.
Be careful.
Ham? (GASPS)
Don't be afraid, granddaughter.
Don't be afraid.
Grandfather?
Yes.
What are you doing down here?
I'm looking for berries.
I have a craving.
Come and help me look for them.
My eyes aren't as good as they used to be.
I have to find Ham.
There's time enough for that.
Come here.
Come.
Come here and help me.
They're here somewhere.
They're here somewhere, berries.
I know there are berries.
There's nothing here, Grandfather.
- Let me take you to Noah.
- No.
No need for that.
You go.
Oh, wait.
Wait.
Ten years you've been with my own.
With my own family.
Ten years.
And you love them?
Shem?
And Noah?
He saved my life.
Raised me.
Yes, he did.
Yes.
And you are now as his own daughter.
My own great-granddaughter.
Ten years in the shadow of my home, and yet I have never given you my blessing.
May I?
SHEM: Ham!
Ila!
You can go now.
Go to him.
You go.
Go now.
SHEM: Ila!
Ila!
Ila!
We have to get back...
We have to go.
We have to go.
Come on.
I am a man.
Made in Your image.
Why will You not converse with me?
I give life.
I take life away.
As You do!
And I am like You, am I not?
Speak to me.
Speak to me!
It has begun!
Death comes from the heavens!
This rain is meant to wash us off the face of this world.
But we are men.
We decide if we live or die.
We are men!
And men united are invincible!
Do you want to live?
ALL: Yeah!
We kill the giants!
We kill Noah!
We take the ark!
ALL: Yeah!
NAAMEH: Noah!
Where's Ham?
Get it off me, no! Ow!
No, no, no!
We have to get away!
I won't leave you.
I won't!
(SOBBING) NOAH: Ham!
Father, help!
Help!
- Help her!
- Help me, please!
Please, help me, please!
Please...
Someone please help me!
Help me!
No!
NOAH:
Ham! Ham!
Ham!
Ham!
Ham! Ham!
Ham!
Samyaza!
Samyaza!
Samyaza! - Noah!
- Where is Ham?
Ham is through!
Quickly!
Run!
NAAMEH:
Ham!
TUBAL-CAIN: Faster!
Forward!
Protect your mother.
Protect them all.
Part!
My Creator, forgive me.
The Creator brings him home.
NAAMEH: Ham?
Ham?
Shem.
Shem, go inside.
Go inside.
They are upon us.
Go inside!
Good-bye, son of Adam.
Son, where are you?
Ham! (SNAKES HISSING)
Ham?
Ham?
It's all right.
ILA: - Shem!
JAPHETH:
- Father! NAAMEH: Japheth, where are you?
SHEM:
- Ila, I'm here!
JAPHETH: - Father! ILA:
Please, Noah, there must be something we can do.
We can drag ropes.
They cannot all be soldiers, Father.
They are just people.
And there's room.
There is no room for them.
Soon everything we knew will be gone.
All that is left of Creation will lie within these walls.
Outside, just the waters of chaos again.
You are angry.
You judge me.
Let me tell you a story.
The first story my father told me, and the first story that I told each of you.
In the beginning, there was nothing.
Nothing but the silence of an infinite darkness.
But the breath of The Creator fluttered against the face of the void, whispering,
And light was.
And it was good.
The first day.
And then the formless light began to take on substance and shape.
A second day.
And our world was born.
Our beautiful, fragile home.
And a great, warming light nurtured its days.
And a lesser light ruled the nights.
And there was evening.
And morning.
Another day.
And the waters of the world gathered together, and in their midst emerged dry land.
Another day passed.
And the ground put forth the growing things.
A thick blanket of green stretching across all Creation.
And the waters, too, teemed with life.
Great creatures of the deep that are no more.
Vast multitudes of fish, some of which may still swim beneath these seas.
And soon the sky was streaming with birds.
And there was evening.
And there was morning.
A fifth day.
Now the whole world was full of living beings.
Everything that creeps, everything that crawls, and every beast that walks upon the ground.
And it was good. It was all good.
There was light and air and water and soil, all clean and unspoiled.
There were plants and fish and fowl and beast, each after their own kind.
All part of the greater whole.
All in their place.
And all was in balance.
It was paradise.
A jewel in The Creator's palm.
Then The Creator made Man.
And by his side, Woman.
Father and mother of us all.
He gave them a choice.
Follow the temptation of darkness or hold on to the blessing of light.
But they ate from the forbidden fruit.
Their innocence was extinguished.
And so for the ten generations since Adam, sin has walked within us.
Brother against brother.
Nation against nation.
Man against Creation.
We murdered each other.
We broke the world.
We did this.
Man did this.
Everything that was beautiful, everything that was good, we shattered.
Now, it begins again.
Air, water, earth, plant, fish, bird and beast.
Paradise returns.
But this time, this time there will be no men.
If we were to enter the Garden again, it would only be to destroy it once more.
No.
The Creator has judged us.
Mankind must end.
Shem and Ila, you will bury your mother and I.
Ham, you will bury them.
Japheth will lay you to rest.
You, Japheth, you will be the last man.
And in time you, too, will return to the dust.
Creation will be left alone, safe and beautiful.
I'm very sorry about that girl.
And I'm sorry for you.
But we have been entrusted with a task much greater than our own desires.
Ham.
Noah...
Does he know I'm here?
- Does he know I'm here?
- No, no, no. No.
Why are you helping me?
There was a girl.
I tried to bring her.
But he just let her die.
And now you want revenge.
No.
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
There's no more land.
Everything out there must be dead.
It had to be what He wanted.
A world without man.
You see that, don't you?
What I see is how hard this was for you to do
as a man who respects life, a man who loves his children.
You've been strong.
But it's done.
It's done now.
And you can put that burden down.
Noah.
It's all right.
If your father found me, he would kill me.
We must be ready, but I am too weak.
What are you doing?
I must get my strength back.
The beasts are precious.
There are only two of each.
And there is only one of me.
But the rain, all these miracles, are for them.
Them?
Your father fills a ship with beasts while children drown.
He belittles you by telling you, you must serve them.
Oh, no.
They serve us.
That is the greatness of men.
When The Creator finished making the sky, the ground, the sea, and this beast,
He wasn't satisfied.
He needed something greater.
Something to take dominion over it and subdue it.
So He made us in His image.
Us.
This is your world, Ham.
Seize it.
Ila.
Oh, Grandfather.
What is it?
You're not sick.
But that's impossible.
What?
What is it?
Noah.
It is his grandchild.
What's wrong?
- Father.
- Noah.
We've come to ask for your blessing.
I don't understand.
I am with Child.
It's not possible.
You're barren.
You can't conceive.
How...
- How is that possible?
- Grandfather.
- I asked Grandfather...
- To what?
Undermine The Creator?
To give our children a future.
To give humanity a future.
Have you any idea what you've done?
All those lives!
All those people!
For nothing!
Do you know what this forces me to do?
NOAH: No!
Please!
Please!
Please!
I cannot do this!
Tell me I don't need to do this!
Please.
Have I not done everything that You asked of me?
Is that not enough?
Why do You not answer me?
Why?
I will not fail You.
I will not fail You.
I will not fail You.
It shall be done.
It shall be done.
Father?
ILA: The rains have stopped.
The Creator smiles on our child.
The rains have stopped because of your child, yes, but He does not smile.
If your child is a boy, he will replace Japheth, last man.
If it is a girl, who could mature into a mother,
she must die.
Are you mad?
That is my Child!
If you should bear a girl, in the moment of her birth, I will cut her down.
(EXHALING) JAPHETH: Mother!
Mother, my bird!
NAAMEH:
Nothing. No mud.
Nothing.
We still have to go.
Ila.
There's nothing.
There's nothing out there.
You have food and water for how long?
Weeks?
- A month?
SHEM: - A month.
Please wait.
Wait until the bird finds land. Please.
Japheth, send him again.
- He's too tired.
- Then wake another.
Here.
Please. One that can find us a home.
No.
We leave today.
NAAMEH: They will die out there.
Not if they stay.
And let you kill their child?
Noah.
Noah!
I did this.
I did this, Noah!
Please!
Punish me!
Punish me, Noah!
Not them.
Not the child.
Please.
The child is not being punished.
We are all being punished.
All of us.
It's not something I want to do.
It's something I have to do.
It is painful,
but it is just.
Just?
How?
How is this just?
(VOICE BREAKING) It's a baby, Noah.
If you hold to this, you will lose your sons, you will lose Ila, you will lose me.
I love you, Noah.
And I have followed you everywhere.
Through everything.
I forgave you.
When everyone was dead, I forgave you.
I was ready to die with you.
But this
I will never forgive.
Boy or girl, I will never forgive!
And you will die alone!
Not just alone, but hated!
Hated by everyone you love!
That is just!
That is just.
It's time.
Bring him through there.
One blow will finish it.
Just in case, huh?
I don't know if I can.
He killed your woman.
And now he plots to kill your brother's firstborn.
Is that what you want?
You want your sister to die on the seas?
A man isn't ruled by the heavens.
A man is ruled by his will.
So I ask you, are you a man?
Good.
Because if you're a man, you can kill.
But he won't follow me.
SHEM:
You take care of that baby.
Don't be afraid, Mother.
We'll see each other in the new world.
Father.
SHEM: No! No!
How could you?
I thought you were good!
I thought that's why He chose you.
He chose me because He knew I would complete the task, nothing more, son.
(GASPING) Mother. (WATER BREAKING)
Mother.
It's your time.
Come. Come with me.
You're all right.
SHEM: Japheth, stand back.
NAAMEH: Come now. Come inside.
That's right. That's right. Shh.
You're all right, Ila. You're safe here.
Please keep it inside.
Your baby's coming.
Your baby's coming, Ila.
Don't think about anything else.
Father!
Father, they're awake!
They're awake!
They're eating each other!
- The beasts.
- What?
Come.
Come!
It's not possible for them to have woken up without our help.
Which way, son?
That's right.
That's right.
The line of Cain.
I told you,
I'm not afraid of miracles.
NAAMEH: That's right. That's right.
A bit more.
(GROANING) Boy or girl?
What's happening?
There's another.
Two?
Twins.
Mother, so?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Sisters.
No.
(SOBBING) No! No!
No!
He will not touch our daughters.
No!
Shem!
Shem!
TUBAL-CAIN: I should have killed you when I killed your father.
Well, now we finish it. Now!
The evils of mankind will not live in this new Eden.
Leave us!
Leave us alone!
TUBAL-CAIN: He's mine!
The ark, the beasts, and all of your women are now mine.
I will build a new world in my image!
Now you are a man.
The Creator has not forgotten us.
Her name was Na'el.
She was innocent.
She was good.
It's a boy.
It's a boy.
- It's a boy.
- Move away.
It's a boy.
Where is she?
(NAAMEH SOBBING) Where is she?
No. No. No.
(SOBBING) You can't.
They're beautiful.
They?
You can't kill two.
He sent us what we need.
Oh, no. No. No!
You can't!
No!
NAAMEH: Noah!
Ila!
Noah.
Please.
These are my children!
- Your grandchildren!
- I will not be stopped.
I know I cannot stop you, but they're crying!
Please don't let them die crying.
Let me calm them.
Please, just let them be at peace.
You do not need to see this.
I will hold them.
Do it quickly.
Do it quickly!
I cannot do this.
It's all right.
SHEM: Hide your eyes, Japheth.
NOAH: - Ham?
SHEM: - He's here.
You don't have to go.
I don't belong here.
For what it's worth,
I'm glad that it begins again with you.
Maybe we'll learn to be kind.
Will he come back?
Some things cannot be unbroken.
I have to know...
Why did you spare them?
I looked down at those two little girls, and all I had in my heart was love.
Then why are you alone, Noah?
Why are you separated from your family?
Because I failed Him.
And I failed all of you.
Did you?
He chose you for a reason, Noah.
He showed you the wickedness of man and knew you would not look away.
But then you saw goodness, too.
The choice was put in your hands because He put it there.
He asked you to decide if we were worth saving.
And you chose mercy.
You chose love.
He has given us a second chance.
Be a father.
Be a grandfather.
Help us to do better this time.
Help us start again.
The Creator made Adam in His image, and placed the world in his care.
That birthright was passed down to us.
To my father, then to me, and to my sons,
Shem,
Japheth,
and Ham.
That birthright is now passed to you, our grandchildren.
This will be your work,
and your responsibility.
So I say to you, be fruitful and multiply
and replenish the earth.
Yes.
I picked him up from the airport this afternoon.
I know.
You know what I need?
Are you afraid, my friends?
Of us?
Of Islam?
People are suffering throughout the Muslim world.
In Palestine, Afghanistan, Baghdad.
But do I believe terrorism is the justifiable consequence of this suffering?
No.
Violence against the innocent is not the way of Allah.
My charities are set up around the world to stamp out poverty, as well as promote religious tolerance and understanding.
We rely on your generous support to continue our work.
Thank you.
Yes, Maxi.
- Maxi? What have you got?
- Yeah?
Around 11:00 a.m. police received a report about a suspicious figure in the central train station.
They were sent this image taken from a mobile phone.
The quality's not great but good enough to make a match.
Karpov, Issa.
Chechen, 26.
Classified as an escaped militant jihadist.
Potentially violent.
Approach with caution.
Pull that down.
Security footage has him returning to the station five times during the day.
Do we know that guy?
Not yet.
Working on it. Give me the hands.
Some sort of note?
Currency maybe.
That's our last sight of him.
Who else knows he's out there?
The cops haven't made a connection.
And upstairs?
Doesn't look like it.
If not yet they will soon.
Karl, Rasheed, start with the mosques, homeless shelters, don't break anything.
Niki, try the railway station.
Find out who the hell that scrawny bastard is.
Great.
Thank you.
Issa Karpov.
A Muslim first name and a Russian last name.
What does that tell us?
That the boy is confused.
And no patronymic.
Is he the son of nobody?
Issa...
Jesus no less.
Maybe he's the son of God and he's come to save us.
Save me.
Doner plate.
Coffee, black.
Coffee, black.
- One euro.
- Cheers. Salam.
Thank you.
Hello.
That scrawny bastard, they call him the Admiral.
He's drinking at Silbersack Bar.
I think you know the place?
Better than I should.
I'm looking at the receipts from Abdullah's trip to Dubai.
Why make a four hour layover, in Cyprus, on your way back from Dubai, to Frankfurt?
When you can fly direct?
I don't know, Gunther.
With my luck that's probably all it is.
"Seven Friends."
Is that all you have, Günther?
I wish.
It's a shipping company based in Cyprus.
Okay, I'll check it.
All right. Bye-bye.
Admiral.
Admiral.
Herr Dinkelmann.
Missing persons.
Strange boy.
Nervous.
He asked me to find someone for him.
A banker.
And this banker, did he have a name?
You don't want it?
Brue.
Monsieur Tommy Brue.
Brue.
Word is Mohr is on to something.
His boys are hitting the streets.
Günther?
They found Karpov.
Good.
Keep him walking.
Karpov, the Russian, he's ours.
Am I to understand you've found him?
I remind you that your license to operate in Hamburg is contingent on your co-operation with my office.
I am co-operating, Dieter.
I want this kid to talk to whoever he was told to talk to, pray wherever he was told to pray, sleep wherever he was told to sleep.
I don't want anybody else getting close to him before we do.
And if this kid lets off a bomb?
It's in your hands, Günther.
Thank Christ it's not in yours because if it was you'd fuck it up.
Then I want it in writing, your signature on the letter, because when the bomb goes off in Hamburg
I want you there to see the blood on the streets.
Have you ever seen blood on the streets?
Clown.
Melik. We have a guest.
This is Issa, from Chechnya.
That's the kind of face I make.
Weddings.
Every time I attend one, I see another good woman going to the wall.
Well, what about the man?
The man is the wall.
The apartment belongs to a Leyla Oktay.
Turkish national, German resident.
A widow.
One son, Melik.
Michael.
They have a citizenship application pending.
Michael.
You've upset Dieter Mohr.
Really?
It probably has something to do with the terrorists you're allowing to walk the streets of Hamburg.
We're on a wait and see approach.
And what are we seeing?
Enough to keep waiting.
Don't underestimate Mohr.
He's got a lot of friends here in Berlin.
Why don't you give him the Chechen?
Let him shine while you stay focused on Abdullah.
I think he's moving the money to a shipping company.
Are you sure?
Not yet, but close.
I need more time.
I'll do what I can, Günther, but watch your back.
Word is the Americans are taking an interest.
Thanks for the warning.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Americans.
Günther Bachmann?
Martha Sullivan. US Embassy, Berlin.
I know you by reputation, of course.
That can't be good.
Men with good reputations usually aren't much use to me.
What about women?
This is my colleague Irna Frey.
- Hello.
- Hello. She sails and spies.
I don't sail.
Hamburg's a long way from Berlin.
What are you doing here?
Me? I am just an observer.
I have been observed by Americans before.
It usually doesn't end well.
From what I'm hearing, we're not the ones you need to be worrying about.
Good morning, everyone.
Herr Mohr has compiled a report.
Our investigations confirm that Issa Karpov is a member of a militant Salafi group of Chechen jihadists.
Karpov was arrested soon after the capture of the group's leader earlier this year.
Where did this information come from?
We have excellent resources inside the Russian state security system.
After 24 hours of questioning, Karpov confessed to taking part in attacks on gas pipelines, transport, infrastructure, police stations.
After 24 hours of Russian questioning any one of us would admit to anything.
Are you contesting this report?
No. Yes.
Maybe.
We've not yet had the benefit of reading it.
The report concludes that the terrorist Karpov has come to Hamburg seeking to make contact with Islamist cells operating in the city.
They hide among us.
- Really?
- Yes. Karpov is a wanted man.
If you have knowledge of his whereabouts, you are obliged to follow due process under the constitution.
You mean arresting him?
Issa Karpov is indeed seeking to make contact in Hamburg, with a banker.
We've had no briefing on this.
Well, if you were doing your job, you wouldn't need one.
We're not policemen.
We're spies. Issa Karpov may be of value to us.
All I'm asking for is more time.
Our unit was set up to develop intelligence resources inside Germany's Islamic community.
That's why we're here.
And I thought you were here because you fucked up in Beirut and your friend Michael Axelrod had no idea...
This banker, do we know what Karpov wants from him?
Not yet and if we move against him now, the chances are we never will.
I think he knows what he's doing, Otto.
Maybe you should let him get on with it.
You have 72 hours to bring this matter to a resolution, if not, we will, with or without your co-operation.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Where should we go?
Meet at the place on the corner?
Okay.
I'll catch up with you later.
Okay, we'll see you there.
Melik?
Did we have an appointment?
Annabel Richter, Mama.
Hello, Leyla. How are you?
Welcome to our house, Frau Annabel.
Nice to see you again.
Come in. Come in please.
Thank you.
The boy is good, Frau Annabel. Do you understand?
If he has done something wrong, it's because he had no...
Hello, Issa.
My name is Annabel Richter.
I am a lawyer.
I work with an organization called Sanctuary North.
- Please?
- Okay.
Are you seeking asylum in Germany?
I make coffee.
There has to be a reason.
Either you cannot return to your country of origin because your life would be in danger or you have been tortured.
Yes.
Yes, what?
I have been tortured.
Forgive me, but this is my job.
I want to believe you, but people make this claim all the time.
I have to...
Who did this to you?
Roosskie.
I cannot help you unless you are honest with me.
It's only a matter of time before the German authorities will find you.
It's better for your case if you go to them first.
- We can make a formal...
- I will never, never go back to Russia.
Please?
You will contact this man.
He will help me.
Mr. Thomas Brue.
Colonel Grigori Borisovich Karpov, stationed in Chechnya, 1986.
He was involved with organized crime.
Big time. Drugs for arms. White slave traffic.
You name it he was in to it.
Karpov died two years ago.
- And?
- He had a son.
Ivan.
Born, 1986 in Chechnya.
Mother unknown.
Good.
Fraulein Richter?
Please follow me.
Please.
What exactly is Sanctuary North?
I'm a lawyer.
Our clients are people who have left their place of birth.
They are effectively stateless.
They are often traumatized.
What is it you want, Miss Richter?
A donation?
I'm sorry.
That was insensitive.
I'm here on behalf of a client.
His name is Issa Karpov.
Is the name known to you?
Karpov?
No.
He is in possession of a letter written by your father to his.
It makes reference to a Mr. Lipizzaner, as in the Spanish horses which are born black but gradually turn white.
Yes.
This is a process I'm guessing your bank is familiar with?
The letter contains a number.
Does it fit?
Does it fit what?
Is the number an account reference in use at this bank?
I'm afraid my bank doesn't broadcast the manner in which it does its business.
I'm sure that suits your clients very well.
But if this number does pertain to an account held at this bank, it would have been established quite some time ago.
I will need to check our records.
Once I have done so I will call you.
When?
My client's situation in Hamburg is extremely sensitive Mr. Brue.
I'm sure.
He trusts you.
As, judging by the contents of the letter, his father trusted yours.
Big boy.
Six... 3448.
"Grigori Borisovich Karpov."
Sorry.
That's all right. I've given up.
Yeah?
Good luck with that.
Yes?
Okay.
The Atlantic.
I'll be there.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Have something to drink?
Glass of wine?
Still water please.
Still water. Of course.
You frequent the Atlantic?
Not your scene?
You said your client's situation was sensitive, hence the hurry.
I can confirm that the reference number you supplied does pertain to an account held at Brue Freres Bank.
Then he intends to make a claim.
Then tell him to bring a large suitcase.
Of course he will need to establish his identity.
My client entered the country in difficult circumstances.
He has the letter.
- I will need to see it.
- Of course. And in addition, he will need to provide a certain instrument.
Which is?
I'm afraid I can't say, but if your client is legitimate he will know what I am talking about.
And if he has this instrument?
I see no difficulty in proceeding.
She's coming out.
Attractive.
Not my type.
What is your type, Günther?
You are, Irna. You know that.
Johannes-Brahms-Platz.
Hello, Tommy.
And you are?
My name is Bachmann.
I head an anti-terror unit not many people know about and even less like.
Let's walk.
Hamburg is one of the great ports of the world, Tommy.
For centuries it opened its arms to every foreigner who washed up on its shores.
Now, since 9/11, in the eyes of every dark-skinned man we see someone who wants to kill us.
Problem is some of them do, but the question is whether Issa Karpov is one of them.
The lawyer.
Lawyer?
Annabel Richter.
The one you met at the hotel. The one you'd like to fuck.
What?
Not true?
You're too old for her, Tommy.
We both are.
See her, love her, but you'll never get her, not even with all that black money you've got tucked away in your bank vaults.
As far as I am aware, Miss Richter represents a client with a legitimate financial interest with my bank.
Your bank does business with the Russians, right?
It did. In my father's time.
Mafia?
Military mainly.
What's to stop me from just walking away from this?
Whatever this is.
How about we start with a full audit of your books?
But your father wasn't just a banker, Tommy.
He was a laundryman.
You're threatening me?
Just sympathizing.
You've been left to clean up the mess.
We have a job to do, Tommy.
You're going to help me do it.
Do what exactly?
Save Annabel Richter, for a start.
From what?
From all of it.
I wasn't expecting you.
No?
Who were you expecting?
Bad day?
A few surprises.
Enjoy your scotch, Tommy.
And try not to fall over on your way to bed.
Issa, it is somebody for you.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Thank you for coming.
Of course.
Issa.
This is Mr. Brue.
Morning.
Perhaps you could show him the letter.
"My dear Karpov,"
"as discussed, please accept this letter"
"as assurance from one friend to another,"
"that in the unfortunate circumstance of your death"
"I should be pleased to acquaint your own dear son,"
"Ivan Grigorevich Karpov,"
"with our friend Mr. Lipizzaner."
"He need only present this letter,"
"together with the necessary instrument"
"currently in your possession for me to act."
"In case of my own death,"
"my son Thomas will fulfill my promise to you."
Forgive me. It's correct signature of your father?
It is.
Should I address you then as Issa or Ivan?
Issa.
It's my Muslim name and I like.
But not the one your father gave you?
My mother was Chechen.
I wish, sir, with your help, to make an honorable life in Hamburg.
Very good, but first, you understand there are certain questions of fact.
I bring your attention to the matter of the instrument.
May I ask how you came to be in possession of this?
It was given to me by my father's lawyer.
So it seems I am being asked to fulfill one father's promise to another.
It's true. Karpov was my father.
You weren't close?
My father was a murderer.
He has Chechen blood on his hands.
And yet you seem willing enough to take his money?
I understand you came here from Turkey, by an informal route, shall we say?
May I ask, what you were doing in Turkey?
I was in prison.
And before that?
I was in prison in Russia.
- Why? - You don't need to answer that, Issa.
Why not?
Because it is immaterial.
To what, Fraulein Richter?
Your client...
He's your client, too, Mr. Brue.
Your client lays claim to his father's account, yet he has no passport, cannot prove his identity.
He has the key and the letter, what more do you want?
We couldn't hear everything so well, Tommy.
So exactly how much are we talking about?
I can't tell you.
Not exactly.
A ballpark figure?
10,000, 100,000, 500,000?
We're talking upwards of 10 million euro.
At least.
- Coffee.
- Yes, sir. - Black.
- Right away.
I wasn't sure you'd come.
I want to make one thing clear.
I don't owe you anything.
What happened in Beirut?
You know what happened in Beirut.
My networks were blown.
So Hamburg is a punishment?
Depends on whether you like Hamburg.
Unless that's what you want people to think?
Take some of the heat off you so you can get on with the real game.
Which is?
Dr. Faisal Abdullah.
Come on, Günther, we probably know as much about him as you do.
What do you know, Martha?
We know you've been watching him for months, and we know you're under pressure to get results.
And we know that the man moves money through a network of Muslim charities and every time he does, some of it goes missing.
Dr. Faisal Abdullah is everything we want him to be and a little bit more.
He's tolerant, enlightened, engaged with the West.
But every good man has a little bit of bad, doesn't he?
And in Abdullah's case, that little bit
just might kill you.
You know all that, how come he's still walking the streets of Hamburg and not rotting in some cell in Guantanamo?
Because we think, we don't know.
The money leaves and we don't know where it goes.
Anyways, on German soil he's got the protection of German law.
That hasn't stopped you before.
We don't do that anymore.
You want us to do it, then.
I'm more interested in knowing why you haven't done it already?
Please work with us on this one, Günther.
I don't trust you.
Old habits die hard.
That's what I'm worried about.
I was talking about yours.
Have a nice day.
You too.
I got your text.
I...
I can't do this anymore.
Someone's going to find out. I can feel it.
I'm frightened.
They are looking at me.
All of them.
I'm done. It's over.
I am not your spy. I am a student.
You cannot make me do this.
I never made you do anything, Jamal.
And I never will.
You know that.
When we first met, you remember what we talked about?
You remember that?
Family, the future.
Most of us don't get to choose, but you did.
You made the right choice.
It's not easy.
But there's no going back, for any of us.
We can't undo what's done.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Come here.
You're my ears, Jamal, and my eyes. I need you.
You're important to me.
Good.
- Hello?
- Tom my?
Yes.
You need to give Issa Karpov what he wants.
Miss Richter?
Can we talk?
Perhaps we could go for a tea?
What do you want?
I've reconsidered your client's position.
My bank is prepared to honor his claim.
Why have you changed your mind?
Perhaps you convinced me.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Okay.
I'll be in touch.
Annabel?
We should take care.
All of us.
It is our religious obligation to give.
This is the holy practice of Zakat, one of the five pillars of Islam.
Through our adherence to this practice of charity, we are drawn nearer to God.
Günther, the banker called. He did it.
Good.
Issa!
Issa!
Wake up.
Where will you take him?
It's better if you don't know.
We have to go.
It's not safe to stay here. For you or for them.
There are clothes in here.
There's also some scissors and a razor.
Issa, they know what you look like.
Come on, Issa.
They're moving.
Where are we going?
My brother Florien has an apartment that's being renovated.
He's arranged for them to stop work for a week.
Where's the next station?
Okay.
We get out at the next stop.
We have to find another taxi, okay?
Hey.
You're blocking the street!
Hey.
Fuck!
Hello?
Hello?
Against the wall!
Check the other rooms!
Stop!
Bedroom clear.
We're nearly there.
I wish to talk to Mr. Brue.
I spoke with him earlier tonight.
Issa, he says the bank will honor your claim.
I do not want the money.
What?
Father's money is bad money.
But without it you have nothing.
I have God.
I brought you some food.
There's a sleeping bag and some more clothes.
I'll be back first thing in the morning.
It is not a prison.
This was the best you could do?
I am a cave dweller.
I'll leave the rooms with a view to you.
You let Mohr off the leash?
He doesn't need me to give him a reason to piss you off.
You've lost Karpov, haven't you?
I need the lawyer to move freely.
I don't have that kind of influence, Günther.
We both know you have all the influence you choose to have.
Look, if you want me to help you on your way, you've got to tell me.
Tell me which way you're heading.
Last month a cargo ship left Cyprus.
It was carrying 1,000 tons of donated grain bound for Djibouti.
It stopped to re-fuel on the south coast of Yemen.
When it reached its destination there were 900 tons left.
At the same time 100 tons of grain mysteriously hit the open market in the Yemen.
The money from its sale was used to buy rocket launchers for Islamist militants.
I think the shipping company is an al-Qaeda front.
I think that's where the missing funds from Abdullah's charities are going.
You think, or you know?
Come on, Günther. Share.
Abdullah's not the bad guy.
He's our way to the bad guy.
A man supplies money that buys weapons that kills Americans and you're telling me he's a pal?
So maybe he's not waving the flag of freedom and democracy as enthusiastically as you'd like.
Okay.
- But he sees his people...
- Spare the lecture.
He sees his people being fucked over from here to eternity.
I've heard that before, so...
Maybe a little bit of him wants to return the favor, but it's that little bit that makes him so valuable.
Don't you see?
Okay. I understand. But that's not what my people would say.
What would your people say?
Take him out? Kill him?
And then what have you got?
A great big fucking hole, and who's going to fill it?
Nobody knows. You least of all.
So we all start looking again, and tap-tapping around in the dark.
You want to own Abdullah, is that what you want?
A man with your reputation and your resources.
How are you going to do that?
Karpov has access to money.
That may be of interest to Abdullah.
And the lawyer?
He trusts her.
It's okay.
It's okay?
Dance.
- Trying to impress me, Günther?
- No. Listen, I'll put Mohr back on the leash, but now you owe me.
Hey, Annabel.
Good to see you. How's Ursula?
Um... No, no.
Let go. Let go of me!
Yes?
Okay?
- Yeah. Good.
- Yeah.
Rasheed?
You can't do this. I'm a lawyer.
This is criminal.
Sit the fuck down.
Lawyer?
You're a fucking social worker for terrorists.
Cigarette?
That's right, you've given up.
Is that it?
Is that all the fight you're going to give me?
Pacifist.
We know about you.
Left-wing lawyer.
Wealthy family.
Father's a judge.
Everything you do says "fuck you" to him.
Is that the best you can do?
Can I go now?
Go where?
Go where?
Back to your self-righteous friends at Sanctuary North?
But no one's going to saw off their heads, are they?
Nobody's going to blow up their kids because you're on a beach in Bali or riding a train to school in Madrid or London.
How fucking dare you?
How fucking dare me?
Tell me I've broken every rule in the book?
That I've trampled on the essence of the constitution?
You want to spout that crap?
Yes?
Do you know where you are?
No, you don't.
This is the real world, Annabel.
We are fighting against the radical off cuts of a nation called Islam.
You've crossed the line.
You're on their side now.
Hello.
I don't care what you do to me.
But you're not the one we're talking about, are you, dear?
Issa must be worried sick.
Wherever you've hidden him, he's probably wondering if you're ever coming back.
I hope he doesn't do anything foolish.
Come, sit with me.
Come on.
There are people out there who want to arrest him.
You know that of course.
We're concerned that they will find him before we do.
There is a difference between them and us.
They want to hurt him.
We want to help him.
You see, Annabel, we're not your enemy.
We're your solution.
Good.
You know what my guys told me?
When they pulled you off the street?
You didn't put up a fight.
Not really.
You struggled a bit.
Screamed a little, but you let them take you.
It's almost as if you wanted it to happen.
You needed someone to take it out of your hands because you are out of your depth, Annabel.
You know you can't save him, not on your own.
Your choice is between us and nobody.
The clock is ticking.
You know they'll find him, and when they do, he'll be on the first plane back to Russia, unless the Americans want him and then we won't know where he is and nor will he.
He doesn't want the money.
He just doesn't want it.
Half radical, half rich kid.
Half Russian, half Chechen.
Loves his mother, hates his father.
You and I both know Issa Karpov has no idea what he wants.
There is something else you and I both know, don't we?
We both know he's innocent.
So what do you want?
I want to help him.
Issa?
Issa, I'm sorry.
I had a dream.
They took you. They tortured you.
And what happened?
Did I tell them where you were?
No.
You are stronger than I was.
You tell them nothing.
Go and put on something warm.
I want to show you something outside.
Okay.
Right.
Look at him.
He's safe.
There's a bed for you here.
It's better that you don't go home.
Herr Mohr and his boys are still out looking for you.
Are you trying to get me drunk?
Yes.
How's Karpov?
Getting there.
And the lawyer?
I already got you all the time I can get.
Beirut was our mistake.
One of our agents blew your network and I know you shared.
Just thought you needed to know that.
We make that kind of mistake.
I can understand why you don't trust us.
Your agents and contacts were compromised.
Men who trusted you died, and that stays with you always.
And all that damage we leave behind.
All those lives, all those empty rooms,
what would they have been for?
You ever ask yourself that question?
Why we do what we do?
Sometimes.
But I always come back to the same answer.
And what is it?
Make the world a safer place.
Isn't that enough?
Move your queen.
Just because you're Russian, doesn't mean you're a better chess player than me.
I'm Chechen.
Okay, so you're good at chess.
Tell me something else about yourself.
You said your mother is Chechen?
She's dead.
I'm sorry.
My father raped her.
She died when I was born.
She was 15.
It was my mother's.
It's beautiful.
You must go.
You can push him a bit more.
Try to get him emotional.
If it happens naturally, lose your temper.
But he doesn't want the money.
I know.
But he wants you.
Günther?
You should take care.
Maybe we're pushing too hard.
Don't go soft on me, Irna.
There's no room for that on this one.
Tell me one where there was.
Morning.
Seventy people died in a market in Baghdad yesterday.
Insha Allah.
God's will?
Or just a man who was arrogant enough to kill in his name?
She's good.
Leyla and Melik have been arrested.
They may be deported, because they were kind to you, because they invited you in to their home.
Explain it to me, Issa!
God's will?
Explain to me why that man who killed those women and children in Baghdad is any different from your own father?
I came to Hamburg to make a new life.
No. You came to Hamburg to find Mr. Tommy Brue.
You came to claim your father's money.
I told you, I do not want his money.
Forgive me.
Maybe there's a way to leave your past behind, Issa.
- Take your father's money...
- Take your father's money,
- and turn it into something good.
- ...and turn it into something good.
Your goat is tethered.
It's just an ordinary pen.
Looks like a pen, writes like a pen and listens like a pen.
Take it apart, it's still a pen.
Are you clear?
Are you clear?
You are acting on behalf of a wealthy Muslim client.
We've been over this.
You are acting on behalf of a wealthy Muslim...
Several times.
...who has come in to a considerable inheritance and the source of the money is questionable.
He seeks to distribute these funds in a spiritually correct manner.
For Christ's sake!
I'm not doing this for you.
Whatever it takes, Tommy.
Hello.
Put your arms up.
Bag?
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Mr. Brue?
- Yes. - Welcome.
- Thank you.
I'm Jamal.
My father is expecting you.
- Can you take off your shoes?
- Of course.
I'll take care of the coat.
Mr. Brue.
- Mr. Brue.
- An honor.
You have met my son Jamal?
Yes, and, another at the door, I believe.
Please sit.
Please.
As explained to you, my client's situation in Germany is delicate.
These are the details of his offer.
As you can see, there are specific requests for some money to be sent to Chechnya.
Hospitals and schools.
Perhaps this is a joke?
You have added a zero to test me.
The figure is correct.
Where did this money come from?
It has come to him in the form of an inheritance.
My client has come to regard it as unclean and seeks your guidance in disposing of it in a manner befitting your religion.
You're an honorable man, I believe that.
But tell me, why should I trust you?
We must trust each other surely.
I am willing, under my client's instruction, to arrange for significant funds to be transferred to you.
You are known as a religious man.
A trusted man.
I accept you will direct this money to the purpose he intends.
Why this urgency?
My client's legal status in Germany is insecure.
I would recommend you accept this gift now, because he may not be in a position to offer it much longer.
Mr. Brue.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Doctor, this way, please.
Dr. Abdullah, may I introduce your benefactor, Issa Karpov, and his lawyer, Miss Richter.
I wish to speak with Issa alone.
Of course.
Miss Richter?
Please tell me, why you have decided to make this generous gift?
Are you under duress?
No.
Look at me.
It is unclean money, sir.
It belongs to a man who has done great evil.
My father.
I wish to be free of him.
Whose sins do you renounce by making this gift?
The sins of my father.
And your own sins?
I believe you feel lost, without God or love.
You must choose the path of Allah.
Only then will you be truly free of this burden.
I am satisfied, Mr. Brue, that his offer is genuine.
Wonderful.
This is a list of charities, with their banking details, for your verification.
Please.
It seems in order.
I will await further instruction.
Michael.
Welcome to Berlin.
Everyone got my report?
Yes.
You need to concentrate on Burgdorf,
Ministry of the Interior.
The final decision will be his.
I'm going to need passports for Karpov and the Turks.
We don't do passports.
He gave the lawyer his word.
I did, and this time I want it to mean something.
It's up there.
We've checked every name on the charity list.
They're all clean.
Herr Bachmann, please.
You're looking at me, at us, but we don't exist, not legally, not officially, because German intelligence needs a job to be done that German law won't let it do, so me and my people we stay small.
We stay on the streets.
We make the weather.
Our sources don't come to us, we find them.
We become their friends.
Their brothers, their fathers, their lovers, if we have to.
When they're ours, and only then, we direct them at bigger targets.
It takes a minnow to catch a barracuda.
A barracuda to catch a shark.
I don't fish, Herr Bachmann.
It's a metaphor, Erhardt.
Just a metaphor.
We take our time.
We watch. We wait.
We see what Allah provides.
Well, this time Allah has provided
Issa Karpov and his ill-gotten millions.
As you can see from the report my team has compiled,
Dr. Abdullah has provided an extensive list of his favorite charities to be the recipients of those millions.
Each one of those charities has been CIA cleared.
It is my belief he will replace one of the names on this list with another.
Seven Friends Navigation Company.
What kind of proof can you show us?
Proof is what we're looking for.
If this Abdullah, if this barracuda, if I've understood the metaphor, takes the bait, with what leverage will you secure his cooperation?
On the negative, threat of prosecution, prison, public humiliation, discrediting of his charities, um, deportation of his wife and children.
I choose the positive.
Amnesty, citizenship, for which he has applied half a dozen times.
Now we are offering citizenship to financiers of terror?
You are all familiar with the operational plan?
We have three hours to apprehend Abdullah and make him ours and get him back home before anyone notices.
And if he does not comply?
Then he's yours.
Do with him whatever you need to do.
And Issa Karpov?
He's to be left alone.
In my eyes it's unacceptable.
Find someone else to parade before the cameras.
That was agreed.
He has our protection.
Martha, what is the American perspective?
Maybe if you could define for us what you think the long-term objective would be.
What are we trying to achieve?
To make the world a safer place.
Isn't that enough?
Mr. Brue?
Tomorrow morning.
Thank you for letting me know.
How are you feeling?
Good.
You drop him at the bank and then you disappear.
Do you understand?
You are forcing me to betray my own father.
You are not betraying him. You are saving him.
That is an act of love.
He's been granted asylum.
It was the best I could do.
I gave you Issa.
Issa gives you Abdullah.
What's next?
What will you do to him?
To Abdullah?
Yes.
Nothing bad.
I promise.
Look.
What does this mean?
It means you can stay.
I have something for you.
- Doctor.
- Hello, Mr. Brue.
This confirms the receipt of funds from Mr. Karpov in to your new account we've set up here.
These are the charities you specified with their bank details.
Each of the transfers is logged in to our system and is ready to go.
Would you please check all the details?
The name of the account holders and the money assigned to each recipient and then authorize each one with your signature.
I would like to make a substitute.
I need to change a name.
Seven Friends Navigation Company?
Yes.
It is a shipping company, but one whose business is charity.
We can have all the aid in the world but it's worthless unless you can get it to the people who need it.
Yes.
All right.
Your final signature.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.
Unfortunately my son is delayed.
Allow us to call you a taxi.
- I'm going in.
- Good luck.
Right.
Yes.
Taxi for Brue Freres.
A pleasure.
As-salam.
My direction, Blankenese.
Stay back!
Wait.
Stop!
What are you doing?
- Wait. - No!
No.
Issa!
- What's going on?
- No!
No!
Stand up.
No!
No!
Issa, no!
Stop it!
No!
No, Issa!
Fuck!
Fuck!
MAN: Get up!
Get up!
The winner, by total annihilation...
Yama!
Who is next?
Who has the guts to step into the ring with Little Yama?
I have a robot. I built it myself.
Beat it, kid.
House rules.
You gotta pay to play.
Oh, uh, is this enough?
What's your name, little boy?
Hiro.
Hiro Hamada.
Prepare your bot, Zero.
Two bots enter, one bot leaves.
Fighters ready?
Fight!
That was my first fight.
I...
Can I try again?
No one likes a sore loser, little boy.
(CHUCKLES) Go home.
HIRO: I've got more money.
REFEREE: Fighters ready?
Fight!
Mega-bot, destroy.
What? Huh?
- No more Little Yama.
- But, wha...
This is not possible!
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.
Beginner's luck.
Do you want to go again, Yama?
- No one hustles Yama! - Whoa.
Hey...
- Teach him a lesson. - (MEN GRUNTING)
Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this.
- Hiro! Get on!
- Tadashi!
Oh, good timing!
Oh, mama!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Are you hurt?
- No.
Then what were you thinking, knucklehead?
You graduated high school when you were 13, and this is what you're doing?
YAMA:
There they are!
Hey! (PANTING)
Hold on!
Whoo-hoo! Yes!
MAN: Get back here.
Bot fighting is illegal.
You're going to get yourself arrested.
Bot fighting is not illegal.
Betting on bot fighting, that's... that's illegal.
But so lucrative!
I'm on a roll, big brother!
And there is no stopping me!
- (SIREN WAILING) - Oh, no.
BOTH: Hi, Aunt Cass.
Are you guys okay?
Tell me you're okay.
- We're fine.
- We're okay.
(SIGHS) Oh, good.
Then what were you two knuckleheads thinking?
For 10 years,
I have done the best I could to raise you.
Have I been perfect?
No.
Do I know anything about children?
No.
Should I have picked up a book on parenting?
Probably!
Where was I going with this? I had a point.
- Sorry.
- We love you, Aunt Cass.
Well, I love you, too!
I had to close up early because of you two felons.
On beat poetry night.
Stress eating. Because of you.
- Come on, Mochi. - (MEOWS)
This is really good!
You better make this up to Aunt Cass before she eats everything in the cafe.
(TYPING) For sure.
And I hope you learned your lesson, bonehead.
Absolutely.
You're going bot fighting, aren't you?
There's a fight across town.
If I book, I can still make it.
When are you gonna start doing something with that big brain of yours?
What?
Go to college like you?
So people can tell me stuff I already know?
Unbelievable.
Oh, what would Mom and Dad say?
I don't know.
They're gone.
They died when I was three, remember?
Hey!
- I'll take you.
- Really?
(SIGHS) I can't stop you from going, but I'm not going to let you go on your own.
Sweet.
HIRO: What are we doing at your nerd school?
Bot-fight's that way!
Gotta grab something.
Is this gonna take long?
Relax, you big baby.
We'll be in and out.
Anyway, you've never seen my lab.
Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab!
- GO GO: Heads up!
- Whoa!
Electro-mag suspension?
- GO GO: Hey! - (GASPS)
- Who are you?
- Uh, I'm...
Go Go, this is my brother Hiro.
- Welcome to the nerd lab. - (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)
Yeah.
I've never seen electro-mag suspension on a bike before.
Zero resistance, faster bike.
(GRUNTS) But, not fast enough... yet.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Do not move.
Behind the line, please.
Hey, Wasabi.
This is my brother Hiro.
Hello, Hiro.
Prepare to be amazed.
Catch.
Wow.
- Laser-induced plasma?
- Oh, yeah.
With a little magnetic confinement for, uh, ultra-precision.
Wow.
How do you find anything in this mess?
I have a system.
There's a place for everything, and everything in its place.
This is anarchy!
Society has rules!
Excuse me!
Coming through! (GRUNTS)
Tadashi!
Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro!
(GASPS) I've heard so much about you!
Perfect timing.
Perfect timing.
That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.
400 pounds of it!
Come here, come here, come here.
You're going to love this.
A dash of perchloric acid, a smidge of cobalt, a hint of hydrogen peroxide, super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and...
Ta-da!
It's pretty great, huh?
It's so pink.
Here's the best part. (GIGGLING)
I know, right?
(LAUGHS)
Chemical metal embrittlement.
Not bad, Honey Lemon.
"Honey Lemon"? "Go Go"? "Wasabi"?
I spill wasabi on my shirt one time, people.
One time!
Fred is the one who comes up with the nicknames.
Uh, who's Fred?
- This guy, right here! - (SCREAMS)
Ah-ah.
Don't be alarmed.
It is just a suit.
This is not my real face and body.
The name's Fred.
School mascot by day, but by night... (GRUNTING)
I am also a school mascot.
So, what's your major?
No, no, no, I'm not a student.
But I am a major science enthusiast.
I've been trying to get Honey to develop a formula, that can turn me into a fire-breathing lizard at will.
But she says that's "not science."
It's really not.
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray
I asked Wasabi for isn't "science" either.
- Is it?
- Nope.
Well, then, what about "invisible sandwich"?
- TADASHI:
Hiro.
- Imagine eating a sandwich, but everybody just thinks you're crazy.
Just stop.
- FRED: Laser eyes? - HONEY LEMON:
What?
- FRED: Tingly fingers?
- WASABI: Never gonna happen.
FRED: Hey, what about a growth serum, huh?
So, uh, what have you been working on?
I'll show you.
Duct tape? (SIGHS)
I hate to break it to you, bro.
Already been invented.
Hey! (SCREAMS)
Oh! Dude!
- Ow! - (BEEPING)
This is what I've been working on.
Hello. I am Baymax.
Your personal healthcare companion.
I was alerted to the need for medical attention when you said, "Ow."
A robotic nurse.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?
Physical or emotional?
I will scan you now.
Scan complete.
You have a slight epidermal abrasion on your forearm.
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's in the spray, specifically?
The primary ingredient is bacitracin.
(CLICKS TONGUE) That's a bummer. I'm actually allergic to that.
You are not allergic to bacitracin.
You do have a mild allergy to peanuts.
Hmm. Not bad.
You've done some serious coding on this thing, huh?
Uh-huh.
Programed him with over 10,000 medical procedures.
This chip is what makes Baymax, Baymax.
Vinyl?
Yeah, going for a non-threatening, huggable kind of thing.
Looks like a walking marshmallow.
- No offense. - BAYMAX:
I am a robot.
I cannot be offended.
- Hyperspectral cameras? - TADASHI:
Yep.
- Titanium skeleton?
- TADASHI: Carbon fiber.
Right.
Even lighter. (GASPS)
Killer actuators.
Where did you get those?
Oh, machined them right here, in-house.
- Really?
- Yup.
He can lift 1,000 pounds.
Shut up.
You have been a good boy.
Have a lollipop.
Nice.
I cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care.
Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.
He's going to help a lot of people.
Hey, what kind of battery does it use?
Lithium ion.
You know, supercapacitors would charge way faster.
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Hamada?
TADASHI: Oh, hey, Professor.
Actually, I was just finishing up.
CALLAGHAN: You must be Hiro.
Bot-fighter, right?
When my daughter was younger, that's all she wanted to do.
May I?
Uh, sure.
Magnetic-bearing servos.
Pretty sick, huh?
Wanna see how I put 'em together?
Hey, genius!
He invented them.
You're Robert Callaghan?
(STAMMERING) Like, as in, the Callaghan-Catmull spline, and Callaghan's "Laws of Robotics?"
That's right.
Ever think about applying here?
Your age wouldn't be an issue.
Oh, I don't know.
He's pretty serious about his career in bot-fighting.
Well, kind of serious.
I can see why.
With your bot, winning must come easy.
Yeah, I guess.
Well, if you like things easy, then my program isn't for you.
We push the boundaries of robotics here.
My students go on to shape the future.
Nice to meet you, Hiro.
Good luck with the bot-fights.
We gotta hurry if you want to catch that bot-fight.
I have to go here.
(STAMMERING) If I don't go to this nerd school,
I'm gonna lose my mind.
How do I get in?
Every year, the school has a student showcase.
You come up with something that blows Callaghan away, you're in.
But, it's gotta be great.
Trust me.
It will be.
HIRO: Nothing!
No ideas!
Useless, empty brain!
Wow.
Washed up at 14.
So sad.
I got nothing! I'm done.
I'm never getting in.
Hey, I'm not giving up on you.
(GRUNTING) What are you doing?
Shake things up.
Use that big brain of yours to think your way out.
- What?
- Look for a new angle.
Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today.
How are you feeling?
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter.
Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.
- Yep, he's nervous. - Oh.
Oh, you have nothing to fear, little fellow.
- He's so tense.
- No, I'm not.
Relax, Hiro.
Your tech is amazing.
Tell him, Go Go.
- Stop whining. Woman up.
- I'm fine!
What do you need, little man?
Deodorant? Breath mint?
Fresh pair of underpants?
Underpants?
You need serious help.
Hey, I come prepared.
I haven't done laundry in six months.
One pair lasts me four days.
I go front, I go back, I go inside-out.
- Then I go front and back. - (GAGS)
Wow. That is both disgusting and awesome.
Don't encourage him.
It's called "recycling."
ANNOUNCER:
Next presenter, Hiro Hamada.
(CHUCKLING) Oh, yeah.
I guess I'm up.
Okay, photo, photo!
Everybody say, "Hiro."
- ALL: Hiro!
- Yeah!
We love you, Hiro.
Good luck!
- Don't mess it up.
- Break a leg, little man.
Science, yeah!
All right, bro.
This is it.
Come on.
Don't leave me hanging.
What's going on?
I really want to go here.
Hey.
You got this.
Uh...
Hi.
- My name is Hiro... - (MIC FEEDBACK)
(STAMMERS) Sorry.
My name is Hiro Hamada, and I've been working on something that I think is pretty cool.
I hope you like it.
This is a microbot.
(MOUTHING) Breathe.
It doesn't look like much, but when it links up with the rest of its pals...
Things get a little more interesting.
The microbots are controlled with this neural transmitter.
I think what I want them to do... (CROWD EXCLAIMS)
They do it.
The applications for this tech are limitless.
Construction.
What used to take teams of people working by hand for months or years, can now be accomplished by one person.
And that's just the beginning.
How about transportation?
Microbots can move anything anywhere, with ease.
If you can think it, the microbots can do it.
The only limit is your imagination.
- Microbots! - (CROWD CHEERING)
CASS: That's my nephew!
- Yes! - Whoo-hoo!
My family!
I love my family!
- TADASHI: Nailed it! - (LAUGHS)
- HONEY LEMON:
You did it! - GO GO: Not bad!
FRED: Yeah!
You just blew my mind, dude!
They loved you.
That was amazing!
KREI: Yes.
With some development, your tech could be revolutionary.
(CHUCKLES) Alistair Krei!
May I?
Hmm. Extraordinary.
I want your microbots at Krei Tech.
Shut up.
CALLAGHAN:
Mr. Krei is right.
Your microbots are an inspired piece of tech.
You can continue to develop them, or you can sell them to a man who's only guided by his own self-interest.
Robert, I know how you feel about me, but it shouldn't affect...
CALLAGHAN: This is your decision, Hiro.
But you should know
Mr. Krei has cut corners and ignored sound science
- to get where he is. - (SIGHS)
KREI: That's just not true.
I wouldn't trust Krei Tech with your microbots,
- or anything else. - (INHALES)
Hiro, I'm offering you more money than any 14-year-old could imagine.
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei, but they're not for sale.
I thought you were smarter than that.
Robert.
Mr. Krei.
That's my brother's.
That's right.
I look forward to seeing you in class.
- Unbelievable!
- A-ha! WASABI: That's what I'm talking about.
CASS: All right, geniuses, let's feed those hungry brains.
Back to the café!
- Dinner is on me! - Whoo!
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!
- Aunt Cass?
- FRED:
Unless it's moldy.
We'll, uh... We'll catch up, okay?
Sure.
I'm so proud of you.
(GRUNTING) Both of you.
- BOTH: Thanks, Aunt Cass. - (CHUCKLES)
HIRO: I know what you're going to say.
(IMITATING) "I should be proud of myself,"
"because I'm finally using my gift
"for something important."
No, no.
I was just gonna tell you your fly was down for the whole show.
Ha-ha-hilarious.
- What? - (ZIPS)
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.
Hey, I, um...
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
So, you know, thanks for not giving up on me.
Are you okay?
(COUGHS) Yeah. I'm okay.
But Professor Callaghan is still in there.
Tadashi, no!
Callaghan's in there.
Someone has to help.
HIRO: Tadashi!
Tadashi!
Here.
Have some tea.
CASS: Hey, sweetie.
Hey, Aunt Cass.
Mrs. Matsuda's in the café.
She's wearing something super inappropriate for an 80-year-old.
That always cracks you up.
You should come down.
- Maybe later. - Oh.
The university called again.
It's, uh, been a few weeks since classes started.
But they said it's not too late to register.
Okay. Thanks.
I'll think about it.
ALL: Hey, Hiro.
We just wanted to check in, and see how you're doing.
We wish you were here, buddy.
Hiro, if I could have only one superpower right now, it would be the ability to crawl through this camera, and give you a big hug.
Ow!
Hello. I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.
Uh, hey, Baymax.
I didn't know you were still active.
I heard a sound of distress.
What seems to be the trouble?
Oh, I just stubbed my toe a little.
I'm fine.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?
A zero.
I'm okay, really.
Thanks. You can shrink now.
Does it hurt when I touch it?
That's okay.
No touching.
I'm fine...
Ah!
Ow.
You have fallen.
You think?
- On a scale of 1 to...
- Ow!
- On a scale... - (GROANING)
- On a sca... - Ow!
- On a scale of 1 to 10... - (GRUNTS)
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?
Zero.
- It is all right to cry. - No.
No, no, no, no.
Crying is a natural response to pain.
I'm not crying.
- I will scan you for injuries.
- Don't scan me.
- Scan complete.
- Unbelievable.
You have sustained no injuries.
However, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels indicate that you are experiencing mood swings common in adolescence.
Diagnosis, puberty.
Whoa, what?
Okay. (CLEARS THROAT) Time to shrink now.
You should expect an increase in body hair, especially on your face, chest, armpits, and...
Thank you! That's enough.
You may also experience strange and powerful new urges.
Okay! Let's get you back in your luggage.
I cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care.
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...
My microbot?
This doesn't make any sense.
Puberty can often be a confusing time for a young adolescent flowering into manhood.
The thing is attracted to the other microbots, but that's impossible.
They were destroyed in the fire.
Dumb thing's broken.
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you, uh, find out where it's trying to go?
Would that stabilize your pubescent mood swings?
Absolutely.
Baymax?
Baymax?
Baymax?
What? (GRUNTS)
- Hiro?
- Hey, Aunt Cass!
Wow. You're up and...
Yeah! I figured it was time.
Are you registering for school?
Uh, yes.
I thought about what you said.
Really inspired me.
- Oh, honey, that's so great.
Okay, special dinner tonight.
I'll whip up some chicken wings.
You know, with the hot sauce that makes our faces numb.
- Okay, sounds good.
- Great!
Last hug.
Baymax! (GRUNTS)
- Baymax! - MAN 1:
Hey!
MAN 2: Watch it!
Baymax!
Baymax!
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
I have found where your tiny robot wants to go.
I told you, it's broken.
It's not trying to go...
Locked.
There is a window.
- (HIRO GRUNTING) - Please exercise caution.
A fall from this height could lead to bodily harm.
Oh, no.
Excuse me while I let out some air.
Are you done?
Yes.
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.
Fine, just keep it down.
My microbots?
Someone's making more.
- BAYMAX: Hiro? - (SCREAMS)
You gave me a heart attack!
My hands are equipped with defibrillators.
Clear.
Stop, stop, stop!
It's just an expression.
Oh, no.
Run!
Oh, come on!
I am not fast.
Yeah, no kidding!
Go! Go!
Come on. (GRUNTS)
Kick it down!
- Then punch it! - (GROANS)
Go!
Go!
Oh, come on!
Go, go, go!
Move it!
Come on!
Whoa. No, no. (SCREAMS)
Come on!
The window!
Suck it in!
Baymax!
Hiro?
Come on, let's get out of here.
Go! Hurry!
All right, let me get this straight.
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you, with an army of miniature flying robots.
"Microbots."
- Microbots. - HIRO:
Yeah.
He was controlling them telepathically with a neurocranial transmitter.
So, Mr. Kabuki was using ESP to attack you and balloon man.
Did you file a report when your flying robots were stolen?
No. I thought they were all destroyed.
Look, I know it sounds crazy, but Baymax was there, too.
- Tell him.
- Yes, Officer.
He's telling the truth.
What the... (STAMMERING) What's wrong with you?
Low battery.
(ECHOING) Try to keep it together.
(SLURRING) I'm healthcare, your personal Baymax companion.
Kid, how about we call your parents
- and get them down here?
- What?
Write your name and number down on this piece of paper, and we can...
I've gotta get you home to your charging station.
Can you walk?
I will scan you now.
Scan complete.
(HICCUPS) Healthcare.
Okay.
If my aunt asks, we were at school all day.
Got it?
We jumped out a window.
No! Quiet!
(SOFTLY) We jumped out a window.
You can't say things like that around Aunt Cass.
- CASS: Hiro? - (GASPS)
- You home, sweetie?
That's right.
I thought I heard you.
Hi.
Hey, Aunt Cass.
Oh, look at my little college man.
Ah, I can't wait to hear all about it!
Oh, and wings are almost ready.
Whee!
Will you be quiet?
Yeah, wings! Whee!
All right, get ready to have your face melted.
We are gonna feel these things tomorrow.
You know what I'm saying?
Okay.
Sit down. Tell me everything.
The thing is that, since I registered so late,
I've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on.
What was that?
Mochi.
Ooh, that darn cat. (CHUCKLES)
At least take a plate for the road, okay?
- Don't work too... - Thanks for understanding.
- Hairy baby.
Hairy baby. - (PURRING)
All right, come on.
I'm healthcare, your personal Baymax companion.
One foot in front of the other.
This doesn't make any sense.
BAYMAX: Tadashi.
What?
Tadashi.
Tadashi's gone.
When will he return?
He's dead, Baymax.
BAYMAX: Tadashi was in excellent health.
With a proper diet and exercise, he should have lived a long life.
Yeah, he should have.
But there was a fire and... (SIGHS)
- Tadashi is here.
- No.
People keep saying he's not really gone.
As long as we remember him. (SCOFFS)
It still hurts.
I see no evidence of physical injury.
It's a different kind of hurt.
You are my patient.
I would like to help.
You can't fix this one, buddy.
Uh, what are you doing?
I am downloading a database on personal loss.
Database downloaded.
Treatments include contact with friends and loved ones.
I am contacting them now.
No, no, no!
(STAMMERING) I...
Don't do that.
Your friends have been contacted.
Unbelievable.
Now, what are you doing?
Other treatments include compassion and physical reassurance.
I'm okay. Really.
You will be all right.
There, there.
Thanks, Baymax.
I am sorry about the fire.
It's okay. It was an accident.
Unless...
Unless it wasn't.
(STAMMERING) At the showcase, that guy in the mask stole my microbots.
And...
And then set the fire to cover his tracks.
He's responsible for Tadashi.
We gotta catch that guy.
MAN: (ON TV) It's alive!
It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!
HIRO:
If we're gonna catch that guy, you need some upgrades.
Will apprehending the man in the mask improve your emotional state?
Absolutely.
Let's work on your moves.
Now, let's take care of this.
BAYMAX: I have some concerns.
This armor may undermine my non-threatening, huggable design.
That's kind of the idea, buddy.
You look sick.
I cannot be sick.
I am a robot.
It's just an expression.
AUTOMATED VOICE: Data transfer complete.
I fail to see how karate makes me a better healthcare companion.
You want to keep me healthy, don't you?
Punch this.
Yes!
Hammerfist!
Side kick!
Knifehand!
Back kick!
Gummy bears!
Yes!
(LAUGHS) Yeah! Fist bump!
"Fist bump" is not in my fighting database.
No, this isn't a fighting thing.
It's what people do sometimes when they're excited or pumped up.
Hey, now you're getting it.
I will add "fist bump" to my care-giving matrix.
All right.
Let's go get that guy.
(WHISPERING) Come on!
Get him, Baymax!
(SIGHS) We're too late.
BAYMAX: Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.
Come on.
Always wait one hour after eating before swimming.
Hey!
Come on!
Your heart rate has increased dramatic...
Shh!
Okay, Baymax, time to use those upgrades.
- ALL: Hiro?
- No, no, no!
Get out of here!
Dude, what are you doing out here?
(STAMMERING) Nothing!
Just out for a walk.
Helps my pubescent mood swings.
Is that Baymax?
- Yeah, but you really...
- Uh...
Why is he wearing carbon fiber underpants?
I also know karate.
You guys need to go.
No, don't push us away, Hiro.
We're here for you.
That's why Baymax contacted us.
Those who suffer a loss, require support from friends and loved ones.
Okay, but I...
Who would like to share their feelings first?
Ooh.
I'll go.
Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)
My name is Fred, and it has been 30 days since my last...
Holy mother of Megazon!
Ah... Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, no!
- Go! - (SCREAMS)
- (PANTING) - Baymax, get him!
No, no, no, no, no!
What are you doing?
I'm saving your life.
- (ENGINE STARTS) - Baymax can handle that guy!
BAYMAX: Oh, no.
Wasabi!
Ah, goodbye!
Hiro. Explanation.
Now.
He stole my microbots. He started the fire.
(STAMMERING) I don't know who he is!
Baymax, palm-heel strike!
- Hard left! - (SCREAMS)
That mask, the black suit...
We're under attack from a super villain, people!
I mean, how cool is that?
I mean, it's scary, obviously.
But how cool!
- (PANTING) - Why are we stopped?
The light's red!
There are no red lights in a car chase!
Why is he trying to kill us?
Um, why are you trying to kill us?
It's classic villain.
We've seen too much!
Let's not jump to conclusions.
We don't know he's trying to kill us.
Car!
HONEY LEMON: He's trying to kill us!
Did you just put your blinker on?
You have to indicate your turn!
It's the law!
That's it.
Stop the car!
Baymax and I can take this guy!
Seatbelts save lives.
Buckle up, every time.
WASABI: What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- Did we lose him?
- Look out!
Baymax, hold on!
We're not gonna make it! - HONEY LEMON:
We're gonna make it!
WASABI:
We're not gonna make it!
We're gonna make it!
- We're not gonna make it! - We're gonna make it!
We made it!
Yes!
I told you we'd make it!
Your injuries require my attention.
And your body temperatures are low.
We should get out of here.
I know a place.
Where are we?
HIRO: Fred.
(STAMMERS) Where are you going?
Welcome to mi casa.
That's French for "front door."
It's really not.
Listen, nitwit.
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.
I'm not in the mood for any...
Welcome home, Master Frederick.
Heathcliff, my man!
Come on in, guys.
We'll be safe in here.
Gimme some.
Freddie, this is your house?
I thought you lived under a bridge.
Well, technically, it belongs to my parents.
They're on a vacay on the family island.
You know, we should totally go some time.
GO GO:
You gotta be kidding me.
If I wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask,
I think this would be the weirdest thing I've seen today.
WASABI:
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.
Your body temperature is still low.
Yeah. Uh-huh.
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.
Hmm, it's so nice.
Oh, yeah, ah, that's toasty.
Good robot.
Does this symbol mean anything to you guys?
- Yes!
It's a bird!
- No!
The guy in the mask was carrying something with this symbol on it.
Apprehending the man in the mask will improve Hiro's emotional state.
Apprehend him?
We don't even know who he is.
I have a theory.
WASABI: "Dr. Slaughter, MD"?
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,
Malcolm Chazzletick.
"The Annihilator"?
Behind the mask, industrialist Reid Axworthy.
"Baron von Destruct"?
Oh, just get to the point!
Don't you guys get it?
The man in the mask who attacked us is none other than...
Voila!
Alistair Krei.
- What?
- FRED: Think about it.
Krei wanted your microbots, and you said no.
But rules don't apply to a man like Krei.
HIRO: There's no way.
The guy is too high profile.
Then who was that guy in the mask?
(STAMMERING) I don't know.
We don't know anything about him.
BAYMAX: His blood type is AB-negative.
Cholesterol levels are...
Baymax, you scanned him?
I am programed to assess everyone's healthcare needs.
Yes! (LAUGHS)
I can use the data from your scan to find him.
Uh, you'd have to scan everyone in San Fransokyo.
That might take, I don't know, forever.
No, no, no, no.
I just have to look for another angle.
Got it!
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,
I need to upgrade all of you.
Upgrade who, now?
Those who suffer a loss require support from friends and loved ones.
(LAUGHS) Oh, okay, I like where this is heading!
We can't go against that guy! We're nerds!
Hiro, we want to help, but we're just us.
No.
You can be way more.
Tadashi Hamada was our best friend.
- We're in. - (LAUGHS)
Can you feel it?
You guys, do you feel this?
Our origin story begins.
We're gonna be superheroes!
HIRO: Arms up.
The neurotransmitter must be in his mask.
We get the mask, and he can't control the bots.
Game over.
Super Jump! And live with me forever now Pull the blackout curtains down
Not bad.
Anybody else's suit riding up on them?
HIRO: Hey, guys!
Check this out.
I'd like to introduce,
Baymax 2.0.
FRED: (GASPS) He's glorious.
Hello.
Hold up.
Focus.
Show 'em what you got, buddy.
The fist, show them the fist.
(CHUCKLES) No, not that.
The thing, the other thing.
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!
That's just one of his new upgrades!
Baymax, wings.
FRED: No way!
Thrusters.
I fail to see how flying makes me a better healthcare companion.
I fail to see how you fail to see that it's awesome!
Full thrust.
- Steady, big guy.
Look, let's just take this slow.
(SCREAMS) Up, up, up, up, up!
Thrust, thrust, thrust!
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!
Too much thrust!
No, no, no, no!
Back on!
Back on!
On! On!
On!
Zoom...
Go up! Up, up, up!
(LAUGHING)
Up!
Oh, man!
Maybe...
Maybe enough flying for today.
(SIGHS) What do you say?
Your neurotransmitter levels are rising steadily.
Which means what?
The treatment is working.
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no!
Whoa, Baymax!
(LAUGHING) Yes!
Yeah!
Yes!
HIRO: Wow!
That was...
That was...
Sick.
- It is just an expression. - (CHUCKLES)
That's... That's right, buddy.
I am never taking the bus again.
Your emotional state has improved.
I can deactivate if you say you are satisfied with your care.
What?
No, I don't want you to deactivate.
We still have to find that guy.
So, fire up that super-sensor.
BAYMAX: Functionality improved.
1000% increase in range.
- I have found a match... on that island.
- Killer view. - WASABI:
Yeah. If I...
If I wasn't terrified of heights,
I'd probably love this.
But I'm terrified of heights, so I don't love it.
There.
Baymax, take us in.
Awesome!
Our first landing together as a team.
(WHISPERING) Guys, come on.
"Quarantine"?
Uh, do you people know what "quarantine" means?
BAYMAX: "Quarantine." Enforced isolation to prevent contamination that could lead to disease, or, in some cases, death.
Oh!
There's a skull face on this one.
A skull face!
(WHISPERING) Be ready.
He could be anywhere.
- (ALL CLAMORING) - Fire!
- Spitting fire! Spitting fire!
- WASABI: Yee-ha!
FRED: That was a bird.
(CHUCKLES) Well, at least we know our gear works.
FRED: (SINGING) Six intrepid friends
Led by Fred
Their leader, Fred
Fred's Angels Mm-mmm
Fred's Angels Mm-mmm
Harnessing the power of the sun
With the ancient amulet They found in the attic
The amulet is green
It's probably an emerald
Fred, I will laser-hand you in the face.
Guys.
Shh.
Any sign of him, Baymax?
BAYMAX: This structure is interfering with my sensor.
Perfect.
The robot's broken.
Uh, guys, you might want to see this.
GO GO:
What do you think it is, genius?
(STAMMERS) I'm not sure.
But look.
HONEY LEMON: Hiro.
Krei.
KREI: That's right.
We were asked to do the impossible.
That's what we did.
We've reinvented the very concept of transportation.
Friends, I present Project Silent Sparrow.
General, may I?
Whoa! Magic hat!
Teleportation.
The transport of matter instantaneously through space.
Not science fiction anymore.
Now, we didn't spend billions of tax dollars to teleport hats.
Ladies and gentlemen, you're here to witness history.
Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?
We've invited all these people.
Might as well give 'em a show.
AUTOMATED VOICE: T-minus 30 seconds to launch.
- AUTOMATED VOICE: 29... 28...
- MAN OVER RADIO: This is Argo.
- WOMAN: Capsule's in position.
- 27...
Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity in the magnetic containment field.
- Huh. - Mr. Krei, is there a problem?
No. No problem.
It's well within the parameters.
Let's move forward.
AUTOMATED VOICE: 3... 2... 1...
WOMAN OVER RADIO: Cabin pressure is go. AUTOMATED VOICE:
TECHNICIAN: Field breach! Abort!
We've lost all contact with the pod.
Oh, no.
- MAN 1: It's breaking up!
- MAN 2: The pilot is gone.
- MAN 3: Portal two is down. - (INDISTINCT TALKING)
The magnetic containment field's down!
Krei, shut it down now!
GENERAL: I want this island sealed off!
The government shut down Krei's experiment.
And he's using your microbots to steal his machine back.
Krei is the guy in the mask.
BAYMAX: Oh, no.
Baymax, get us out of here.
Go for the transmitter.
Behind his mask.
Baymax!
All right, what's the plan?
It's Fred time.
Super Jump!
Gravity Crush!
Oh!
Falling hard.
Seriously, what is the plan?
- Get the mask. (GRUNTS)
- Right behind you.
For real, what is the plan?
Hey! (GROANS)
WASABI: Hey!
Uh, you want to dance, masked man? Huh?
'Cause you'll be dancing with these.
Hand over the mask, or you'll get a taste of this!
And a little bit of that!
Hey! I did all right. (CHUCKLES)
Is that all you got?
Oh.
You got that, too?
It's back into the fire!
It's over, Krei.
Pro... Professor Callaghan?
The explosion...
You died.
No. I had your microbots.
But, Tadashi.
You just let him die.
Give me the mask, Hiro.
He went in there to save you!
That was his mistake!
Baymax, destroy.
My programing prevents me from injuring a human being.
Not anymore.
Hiro, this is not what...
Do it, Baymax!
Destroy him!
No!
Stop, Baymax!
No, stop!
He's getting away!
- GO GO: Baymax! - (WASABI GRUNTING)
My healthcare protocol has been violated.
BAYMAX: I regret any distress I may have caused.
How could you do that?
I had him!
What you just did, we never signed up for.
We said we'd catch the guy.
That's it.
I never should have let you help me!
Baymax, find Callaghan.
My enhanced scanner has been damaged.
Wings.
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.
Fly!
ALL: Hiro!
BAYMAX: Your blood pressure is elevated.
You appear to be distressed.
I'm fine!
There. Is it working?
- My sensor is operational.
- Good.
Then let's get...
What?
Are you going to remove my healthcare chip?
Yes.
Open!
My purpose is to heal the sick and injured.
(GRUNTS) Baymax, open your access port.
Do you want me to terminate Professor Callaghan?
Just open!
Will terminating Professor Callaghan improve your emotional state?
Yes!
No!
I don't know!
Open your access!
- Is this what Tadashi wanted?
- (GRUNTING) It doesn't matter!
Tadashi programed me to aid and...
Tadashi's gone!
Tadashi's gone.
Tadashi is here.
No. He's not here.
Tadashi is here.
TADASHI: This is Tadashi Hamada.
And this is the first test of my robotics project.
- BAYMAX:
Hello, I am Baymax. - (LOUD SCREECHING)
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
The seventh test of my robotics project.
BAYMAX: Hello, I...
What? Ooh, what?
Wait, wait, wait, stop!
Stop scan!
Stop...
Tadashi Hamada again, and this is the 33rd test of my robotics project.
I'm not giving up on you.
You don't understand this yet, but people need you.
- So, let's get back to work. - (BEEPS)
This is, uh, Tadashi Hamada, and this is the 84th test.
What do you say, big guy?
Hello, I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.
It works.
It works!
Oh, this is amazing!
You...
You work!
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.
I knew it. Oh, you work.
I can't believe it!
I can't...
Okay.
All right, big moment, here.
- Scan me. - (WHIRRING)
BAYMAX: Your neurotransmitter levels are elevated.
This indicates that you are happy.
I am. I really am.
Oh, man.
Wait till my brother sees you.
You're gonna help so many people, buddy.
So many.
That's all for now.
I am satisfied with my care.
Thank you, Baymax.
I'm so sorry.
I guess I'm not like my brother.
GO GO: Hiro.
Guys, I... Uh, I...
We're going to catch Callaghan, and, this time, we'll do it right.
Eh, but maybe don't leave your team stranded on a spooky island next time.
- Oh, man.
- Nah, it's cool.
Heathcliff picked us up in the family chopper.
Hiro, we found something you should see.
You almost got us all killed!
Krei!
You did this!
You knew it wasn't ready!
HIRO: Callaghan?
He was there?
He was such a good man.
What happened?
I don't know.
But the answer's here somewhere.
Wait, wait!
Stop.
There he is.
HIRO: With the pilot.
- Hang on. - (TAPE REWINDS)
We've invited all these people... (TAPE REWINDS)
HIRO: The pilot was Callaghan's daughter.
Callaghan blames Krei.
This is a revenge story.
So, what are we waiting for?
But none of this would've been possible without a few bumps in the road.
Those setbacks made us stronger, and set us on the path
- to a bright future.
- (PEOPLE CHEERING) MAN:
- What? - YOKAI:
Setback?
Was my daughter a "setback"?
Callaghan!
But you...
Your daughter, that...
That was an accident.
- No!
You knew it was unsafe. - (GROANING)
My daughter is gone because of your arrogance.
What are you doing?
You took everything from me when you sent Abigail into that machine.
Now I'm taking everything from you.
KREI: No!
No!
No! You can't!
You're going to watch everything you've built disappear.
Then, it's your turn.
- HIRO: Professor Callaghan! - (GASPS)
Let him go!
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?
Abigail is gone!
This won't change anything.
Trust me, I know.
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.
Please, let me go.
I'll give you anything you want!
I want my daughter back!
HIRO: Go for the mask!
ALL: Baymax!
- (ALL SCREAMING) - FRED: Leaping into action!
FRED: Oh, no!
Getting a little tight.
- HONEY LEMON:
No! - FRED: He's too strong!
- GO GO: There's no way out! - FRED:
WASABI: Help!
I can't beat him.
(GRUNTING) Hiro!
- GO GO: Hiro?
Hiro?
- WASABI: Help!
- That's it! - GO GO: Hiro.
- I know how to beat him. - GO GO:
Hiro.
Listen up!
Use those big brains of yours and think your way around the problem.
Look for a new angle.
My arms! They can't go any further!
Wait a second, it's a suit.
Hello, sign.
Care to go for a little spin?
Hi-ya! Double spin!
Behind-the-back spin!
Yeah!
HIRO: Baymax!
- (GROANS) - BAYMAX: Hiro.
I love that robot!
Okay, new plan.
Forget the mask.
Take out the bots. They'll get sucked up into the portal.
Now that is a plan!
Honey, Fred, can you give us some cover?
FRED: Like you have to ask.
Let's do this, Freddie!
FRED: Smokescreen!
Ready and dive!
Whoa, the gravity's getting a little weird here, guys!
Wait.
Let's use this!
These are green blades of fury! (LAUGHS)
GO GO:
Woman up!
FRED: Double sign-spin.
Now my signs are on fire!
Now that's a chemical reaction!
BAYMAX: Back kick. Knifehand.
Hammerfist.
This ends now!
Looks like you're out of microbots.
What?
Baymax!
No!
Our programing prevents us from injuring a human being.
- But we'll take that. - (WHIMPERS)
It's still on!
We have to shut it down!
We can't!
The containment field is failing.
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!
We need to get out of here, now!
Baymax!
My sensor is detecting signs of life.
- What?
- Coming from there.
The life signs are female.
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.
Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive.
Abigail.
Let's go get her.
The portal is destabilizing.
You'll never make it.
She's alive in there.
Someone has to help.
What do you say, buddy?
Flying makes me a better healthcare companion.
HIRO: Careful!
There's Krei Tech debris everywhere.
(GASPS) Look out!
I have located the patient.
Hurry!
Come on, buddy, let's get her home.
I'll guide you out of here.
Let's go!
Veer right!
Okay, to the left.
Hard right!
Up and over.
Okay, level off.
Easy.
Whoo-hoo!
Nice flying!
Almost there!
Baymax!
Baymax!
My thrusters are inoperable.
Just grab hold.
There is still a way I can get you both to safety.
I cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care.
No, no, no, no.
Wait.
What about you?
- You are my patient.
- (STAMMERING) Baymax.
Your health is my only concern.
Stop!
I'm gonna figure out...
Are you satisfied with your care?
No.
There's gotta be another way.
I'm not gonna leave you here.
I'll think of something.
There is no time.
Are you satisfied with your care?
Please!
No...
I can't lose you, too.
Hiro,
I will always be with you.
I'm satisfied with my care.
WASABI: Hiro!
FRED:
Yeah! They made it!
Baymax?
Miss, can you hear me?
What is your name?
Abigail Callaghan.
Okay, Abigail, you are gonna be fine.
We're taking you to the hospital.
OFFICER: Move it!
OFFICER: Get in there.
NEWS REPORTER:
A massive cleanup continues today at the headquarters of Krei Tech Industries.
Reports are still flooding in about a group of unidentified individuals, who prevented what could have been a major catastrophe.
The whole city of San Fransokyo is asking,
"Who are these heroes?
"And where are they now?"
- Hey.
- Hi.
It's so exciting.
CASS: Hey, sweetie!
Okay.
Last hug.
Bye!
- And just then I was like...
- Get out of here.
HIRO: Ow?
BAYMAX: I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.
- Hello, Hiro.
We didn't set out to be superheroes, but sometimes life doesn't go the way you planned.
The good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people, and that's what we're gonna do.
Who are we?
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
Dad, I just wish I could share my accomplishments with you.
You mean so much to me, and honestly,
I've always felt a distance what with you being on the family island all the time, and I just wish you could see how...
MAN: Fred.
Son.
Dad?
I wear 'em front, I wear 'em back.
BOTH: I go inside out, then I go front and back.
Dad!
We have a lot to talk about.
Lucky ring on.
I feel so much safer.
We're coming in hot.
Hold on.
Let's go.
What's the hold up?
Nothing, we're on our way.
Let's go.
Your dude's trippin'.
Stay on the wall, beware.
- Hey, forget this maniac. - I'm not leaving him.
Doc!
You're just gonna roll up on me huh?
After 8 damn years.
What's up with that?
You're in a black ops prison that doesn't officially exist.
I just got the location from a guy named Church.
An agency spook.
Excuse me?
Agency's official relax.
Thank you for this, man.
What a waste of life!
You make one damn mistake.
It wasn't a mistake.
It was stupid.
You'd done that to me, I would've chopped you into pieces.
You would've tried.
Hey, you want to thank the guys?
The guys?
Where are our guys?
- Hammer, Guzman... - Gone.
They've gone?
Yeah.
Damn!
Heard you killed more people than the plague!
How 'bout that?
That why they called you "Doctor Death"?
Used to be a medic.
But that was a long time ago.
So why'd you get locked away? Tax evasion.
So you're all that's left of The Expendables?
We're it.
We started out with 5... built up to 22
I see Barney still hanging the tags up there.
See that jingling sounds the tags make, that's a reminder that our brothers are still here.
Somewhere.
Come on viking.
Give me an old school of your blade.
Or else you might find your tags up there.
Jingling too.
Jingling... jingling jingling.
Sharpen it when you're done.
I think your friend is a little off.
Come on Christmas, he's been in a hole for eight years.
How'd he get so lucky!
He tried pulling it off his half-assed political... assassination for a few bucks in this place called Swaziland.
And he blew it.
Self destructive?
Yes something like that. But in all those years he's a good medic.
Well, I don't need a checkup.
- Why are you so sarcastic?
- You're vague.
- Vague?
- Secrets, idiot.
I mean why do you take me off half way round the planet?
To save this medical genius, as you describe.
For what?
- He's an Expendable. - Oh my god.
Come on.
He's an Expendable.
So he's one of the flock?
Let me tell you something...
If you were incarcerated for years,
I'd come and save you. Thanks hero!
But I doubt it.
And I know you'd do the same for me.
Truthfully?
You'd let me rot?
Exactly.
Hey, Doc.
What's your name?
Christmas. Is that real?
Authentic.
Is that real too?
Oh no, I uh... spend 3 hours every morning putting this on with a black biro.
This is real.
Authentic.
Original. Look at that.
Balance is a little off.
You uh, a knife man?
Best, ever
I'm the knife before Christmas.
Ain't that right Barney?
If you say so.
Probably freestyling with a blade while you're still sucking on your daddy's titty... trying to learn how to eat with a spoon.
Yeah.
You know that little secret you were keeping there, Mr. Vaguo?
Just stay out of my brain.
I'm gonna tell you.
I can't wait to get home.
Eat some good food... Put on some fine threads...
Break up my 49' Pontiac...
Keep that baby until the engine blows up...
You didn't tell him did you?
Tell me what?
We're not going home.
We're stopping at a dealer named Victor Menz... delivering a shipment of thermobaric bombs.
Ow, come on man. That shit is hellfire.
Hey, it's routine stuff.
You know why don't you just pick me up on your way back.
We're a man short.
Well, you know, I'd love to party with you boys.
But, uh, I don't have my shit.
That's my shit! It is your shit.
Doc, have you thanked the guys, helping you out?
Say something.
Uh, listen up...
It's been a long time since I had a reason to say thank you...
So I just want..
Oh, you know I...
- He's getting his rhythm. - Just want to say.
Thank you.
Sincerity is overwhelming.
I think I'm gonna weep.
You know what? Enough.
Do not be sarcastic.
That was great, Doc.
You haven't had to talk for a long time.
You got the gift.
It's like riding a bike.
I liked Churchill's best.
I think I made my point. - I've moved you too.
- Stunning.
Doc, great to have you back. No better place to be, yeah.
About time you boys showed up.
Nice boat.
Thanks ladies, built it myself.
Got three more just like it patrolling the harbor.
Two man ground teams every 400m. Good work.
Just cause you can fly a plane don't make you smarter than me.
Sure it does.
So you're the reason I've been stuck down here in this shithole.
Shithole?
Brother you have no idea.
Oh yeah, hahahaha.
What the hell is that?
This bitch will solve all your problems.
Yeah, maybe for 10 seconds...
- before he blows his wad. - So now you got that problem too?
You walked into that one.
Come on, look alive, look alive.
Good luck.
It was all under control.
Yeah, that's what it looked like.
Where you've been?
I had a doctors' appointment.
Catch up with you boys later. What's he got?
Watch your overhead.
Doc, go.
Ooh sadly, the man attacked me with a knife. He's good.
Maybe to you.
You might want to see this.
See what?
I'll show you.
Damn!
He's really good.
Say it again and I'll shoot you. Get in.
Where's the bomb?
It'll be here.
Barney, looks like the target is right on time.
There's Menz, let's take 'em out fast.
Barney, I'm gonna put you down.
It can't be.
What can't be?
We're gonna shoot these guys or what?
What's the hold up?
He's dead.
Who's dead?
Stonebanks.
Come on, get in.
Come on, move! Go go go!
Come on!
Time to mow the lawn!
I told you 10 seconds.
Hang on.
Found you a ride.
Time to go.
Go go go!
- How much we're getting paid for this? - Not enough.
Go right.
You're not gonna fit. Always negative.
I'm getting carsick.
Hang on, Doc.
Get out.
Come on.
Caesar.
We're coming your way, where are you?
In this filthy river, behind you.
Try to stay as close as you can.
Make room for Caeser.
Move your ass in.
Who's that?
A huge black guy on a boat.
Hold it, hold it, you got it going.
- You alright? - Yeah.
Pull over.
Incoming!
Move!
Move!
We got you man, come on!
Maybe this'll bring you luck.
Is he gonna make it?
I don't know.
Who did this?
Stonebanks.
I thought you killed him.
So did I.
He shot Caeser to get back at me.
Yeah, I'm getting out of this business.
And so should you. Not yet.
Hey.
If you need any help with Stonebanks...
I'm supposed to meet a guy named Church.
I know who you are.
So who are you?
Operations officer Drummer.
You don't have to worry about Church anymore.
He's um, he's out of the picture
Jesus, Ross.
What a mess!
We gave you everything.
Target, opportunity, all the intel you could ask for.
And you got decimated.
And my target walked away.
Am I wrong huh?
Am I missing something?
Yeah, sure you said the target's name was Victor Menz.
- And?
- It was wrong.
His real name was Conrad Stonebanks.
We knew him only as Victor Menz.
Arms dealer, made billions selling to every psycho warlord in Africa and the Middle East.
His own mercenary army is personally responsible... for the torturing and killing... two of the best men I ever knew, friends.
I don't give a shit what his name is.
I don't like him.
I want him as bad as you do.
This happened on my watch.
You fucked up, and I'm wearing it
I'll find him. Again.
You have one more shot.
Nice to finally meet you Barney.
Your men are shot to shit, what are you gonna do for a team.
Don't worry about it. I'll handle it.
Relax.
You're gonna give yourself a stroke.
What's with these guys!
Do you mind?
Do you think when the artist painted this, he ever thought it would go for such a ridiculous price?
I mean what is this?
Just some paint, brushes, some cheap canvas, what's the big deal?
It's shit.
What do you want for it?
Three million. Done.
You know...
It's very hard for me to say this... but at one time, you guys were the best.
Maybe still are.
But nothing lasts forever.
Hard as it is to hear.
We're not the future anymore.
Unfortunately for us. We're part of the past.
You.. arr.. you going somewhere with this?
As I see it.
If we keep this life up...
The only way this thing ends... for all of us
is in a hole in the ground and no-one givin' a shit.
Now, if that's the way I'm supposed to go out, I can live with that.
For me.
But what I can't live with.
And I won't live with... is taking you with me.
What are you saying?
That's our call.
I'm changing things now.
You. Me.
All of us.
It's over.
We're done.
Done?
You break me out... Cut me loose?
You'll survive. You all will.
You live your lives while you can.
Where are you going, Barney?
Hey you think you just pulled the plug and that's it?
- Just did.
- Yeah?
Well it doesn't work that way. What?
We've been through the mud... the shit and the blood.
And I've saved your arse more times than I can count.
You owe me a shot at the sonofabitch that took Caeser down.
We're not doing that.
When I joined,
I joined for the whole ride. I know you did.
Rides over.
Bonaparte. Sorry to hear about Caeser.
I hope he pulls through, he's a good one, the good ones are rare.
Yeah. Well, here we are again.
What do you need?
New team.
Retired the old ones.
Welcome to the 21st century.
How many guys you looking for?
Young, hungry, willing to take a bullet.
I'm going after Stonebanks.
Stonebanks.
Let's see, you're not the only one slipping a notch.
Stonebanks is dead my friend mortus dei.
No, he's not.
That is not good.
If he was half of what he used to be, four or five ain't gonna cut it.
You're gonna need fifty.
We gotta move fast, no time.
If I got to do it fast then I can't guarantee the best.
Just give me something that don't give a damn.
What?
Is this a one way ticket?
Could be. Fine.
I got a line on a few head cases.
Couple of these guys'll probably end up shooting themselves.
Wait. What about these guys?
They anything?
These guys are pussies.
Goes by Thorn, expert hacker. Ground pilot.
Did 18 months for hacking into Seattle central operating system.
Shut down the whole city for 3 days.
Why the hell would he do that?
Because he can. What?
I'm not looking for an office worker.
Oh! that's not him.
Another one with a death wish. You two got a lot in common.
I could do that.
You know what?
I'm gonna come around and say it.
I belong on you.
- You can't do that.
- No. I'd want a special rate on that one.
Yeah, yeah, that's the pecker.
Always on the damn road going someplace you don't give a damn about.
Beats standing still.
Yeah, I got two ex-wives... and three kids who've lost my number who'd disagree.
- Hey did you turn off the autopilot?
- I didn't touch the autopilot.
Gimme the booze.
Are we off course? Where the hell are we?
Hang on a second.
Is that the Big Dipper?
Yeah, we gotta turn around.
Next candidate is an expert in field craft and close quarters combat. Luna.
Hi.
Young lady, meet a friend of mine.
Barney Ross. Barney Ross, Luna.
Luna, Barney Ross. - How you're doing? - Nice to meet you Mr. Ross.
Gentlemen if you'd follow me, I have your table waiting.
Come on. Live a little.
So Luna how are things?
You know, gets old.
- What did I do?
- You wanna go, bro?
Would you guys excuse me...
All right so what are we doing here?
Have a drink.
Where's your candidate?
Right there in the red dress about to chop those guys in half.
- The hostess?
- Not the hostess.
She's the bouncer.
I could do that.
You want to slip on a dress and give it a shot.
Men.
She's good.
You oughta see her without heels.
When was your last checkup?
I don't know, a while back.
High cholesterol, plaque, all that stuff.
- Yeah, pretty much. - Yeah. Except with me.
They found a lump on my lung.
Very dark, they said.
Why shouldn't I see that coming?
Well, what do you do?
I try to make as much money as I can, fast as I can.
For those kids, you know. The ones I don't talk to.
Make some kind of a good impression on them, before I'm gone.
Sad, isn't it?
Yeah, it is sad.
I'm sorry.
Nah, that's all bullshit, I'm fine.
Just checking you're still human.
Had you going there now didn't I?
Yeah, you did goddammit.
That can never happen again. I'll never trust you again.
Next kid's a bit of a dark horse.
Just came across my desk.
I don't like throwing in a wildcard.
But this guy's creds were too good to pass up.
Anybody seen Felipe?
Yo Felipe.
Looks good Bonaparte.
Yeah, not bad.
Finally got it right.
Damn!
Felipe Silva!
Meet Barney Ross. Galgo.
Galgo, you sent me another fake resume.
Mr. Ross, I can do what you need, whatever you need.
I am healthier than I look, stronger than I look...
Faster than I look.
Actually, shit, you were born in 1984?
Of course not.
But I feel like that I was born in 1984.
Do not waste your time, Barney we're leaving.
Mr. Ross, Mr. Ross, Mr. Ross.
Please.
It's like uh, it's like I have discovered.. the fountain of youth.
I mean, not.. 'The fountain of youth'.
Ponce de Leon discovered that one.
Um by the way...
Another great Spaniard, like myself.
Mr. Ross.
Age is just a state of mind.
You're only old, when you surrender...
When you give up, and I haven't, not yet.
- Galgo, this shit has got to stop.
- I gotta go. This is the third time this month.
Seriously, move on.
What's this guy's story?
Actually I feel a little sorry for him.
His last team dropped him.
Back in the day, you couldn't catch him.
- Very fast, maybe even faster than you.
- No way. Oh! maybe.
But, what am I gonna say. It's a young man's game.
I need a job!
All I know what to do is killing people And I do that very well.
Damn!
Dammit!
- What's the story on this guy?
- Found him at DARPA.
- DARPA?
- Sounds like a town in North Africa. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
Where they send the brightest military minds to develop next-gen weapons.
Google it. I'm not looking for weapons nerd.
Ah, then you've come to the right place.
Yo Marlito.
Mars I like you to meet Barney Ross.
As shooters go, Mars is as gifted as they get.
Whatever you say.
What do you say?
What I've got here is an X-25 assault rifle.
Laser range, 25mm high explosive air burst rounds.
Can be programmed to detonate over or behind the target.
He'll do.
Final candidate, John Smilee.
Guy's got the most teeth in the industry.
A lot of skills, Marines, special operator.
- But there is, an issue.
- What issue?
Yeah, classic authority problem.
There's a couple more swimming around in there too.
Sorry Barney for wasting your time like this.
He's not the guy I thought he was.
No. I want to meet him.
John. Meet Barney Ross.
Didn't do much to impress out there today did you?
You called me, I didn't call you.
Think you'd die for the money?
Maybe you like getting your ass kicked in front of strangers.
What do you guys want from me?
You running from something?
I don't know you. But I know you.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah. How's that?
Maybe he thinks you got potential and we're short on time.
That about right?
That's about it. What's your problem?
Your problem is you're rolling around in the dirt for chump change.
I hear you lost a few friends in the desert.
They bought it, and you didn't.
And you wear the guilt.
I've been there. He's been there.
We all lived it.
Well you don't know me.
I know the type.
Bonaparte, you're right.
You did waste my time.
You didn't waste your time.
If you're going after Stonebanks, we might want to talk about financials now.
Normally it's just 10%, but..
I figured with Stonebanks in the equation I might want to get my fee... possibly now.
I mean, not that you're not good for it, just, if you don't mind.
I don't mind.
It sounds like you don't have too much faith in me.
I don't.
How was your vacation?
Ready to go to work?
You find him yet?
He's in Bucharest putting together a deal with some Albanian mobster.
You got 36 hours, that's your window.
After that he's back off the grid.
Satellite map...
Coordinates for where he'll be.
Interesting guy.
Your friend Stonebanks.
You're not gonna like this but...
They want him alive.
Are you kidding me?
They want to try him at The Hague... for war crimes.
You're gonna give this guy a chance in court?
It's not my decision.
- No, it never is.
- That's the way it's gotta be.
Great.
Agency's got a local safehouse.
You're gonna need it.
Don't trash the place.
I heard you got a job.
That's right.
Who the hell are they?
They're with me.
And we're not?
Gunner I had told you everything I had to tell you back at the bar.
And stop drinking so much.
You want to get yourself killed... with those youngsters.
Do us all a favor and get the hell out of here.
Wheels up in 10.
If your guys wanted to fight, why didn't they just get married?
You seriously smoking next to aviation fuel?
Amateur.
Amateur assholes.
Who you calling asshole, grandpa?
What is this?
Is this your toy?
Boy?
You want to dance big guy? Hey!
It's just a job.
Come on, let's go.
Bunch of ass has been's still trying to be hard.
You're young and you're dumb.
Jingling jingling.
Keep it.
You're gonna need it.
Never thought you would call in that favor.
I'm also not happy about it.
Got a minute?
What do you need?
Tell me more about this guy we're going after.
It doesn't matter, you were hired to do a job.
How about answering why we're doing this job?
I owe you a salary that's it.
Why are we going after Stonebanks?
You have a hard time taking orders don't you?
If I don't know what they are, yeah.
I know you don't give a damn about us.
I get that.
But just tell me why you want to take out this guy so bad.
Thirty seconds to drop.
Copy that.
Let's go.
I can take care of myself.
Twenty seconds to drop.
Ten seconds...
We're on.
This guy's got more muscle than a cartel king.
Maybe he's overcompensating for something.
What you're drinking down there, Barney?
Is that like vanilla latte or something?
Stay sharp.
Move.
You have to think about this again Mr. Menz.
I promise you this won't happen again.
- Move the car.
- I'm talking to you!
Nice driving Mars.
Good performance.
Yeah, too good.
Any closer and I'd beat his ass.
I believe her. Got 'em.
Oh man, this guy's protected better than the president.
Yeah, and his crib's like a 5-star fortress.
Listen we're not taking him there.
I bet the hotel is full of guests.
So where do we hit them?
At the meet.
We'll hit him from all four sides.
Hit him hard.
OK, um, so...
Our plan is to what?
Kick down the door and start spraying bullets?
It's a great plan...
If it's 1985.
And what's that supposed to mean?
You heard me.
You got a better plan?
Much better.
Let's hear it.
Thorn, you're up.
OK, I'm the plan.
This better be good.
First I hack the security grid main server, boom.
Bypass the motion detector lasers and biometric sensors, pow.
Override the surveillance videos and CCTV systems, ba-bam.
And we are in.
It's child play.
Just like that?
Just like that.
Just like that.
Exactly, like that.
You better be right.
Ba-bam.
Let's go.
So why'd you let your team go?
If you stick around long enough you're gonna buy it.
It was time. They didn't seem too happy about it.
If you're looking to go the family route, it's the wrong job for you.
There are different kinds of family.
And when my life is on the line.
That's my family fighting with me.
You know what I mean.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Right on time.
Ladies first. Go ahead then, Thorn.
Will you shut up and get in the sewer.
And ladies and gentlemen, we officially have eyes in the sky.
Copy that.
Let's do this.
Thought you'd never ask.
Good to go. Good luck boys.
Woah!
Shit! What's the problem?
The buyer, they're early.
Threat just doubled.
You're early.
What do you think?
It's OK.
When Cain slew his brother.
God banished him from civilization.
But before that he placed a mark on him.
It was a felon's brand, but... to protect him from roving hunters.
Customs does not X-ray artwork.
It ruins the oils.
Very good.
There you have it. Gabil.
My pleasure. As always.
Can you access nuclear weapons?
I might.
But generally I find people are a little too emotional for ownership.
And I'd hate you killing all my other customers by accident.
Or on purpose.
In position.
In position.
Set. I pay you what you want.
Let me think about it.
We're on.
Stonebanks is moving, watch it.
Like little mice...
Try again.
Open sesame.
Go go go.
Move.
Go.
Barney Ross says hello.
Nice job.
Trench, you copy?
I'm waiting.
Package is secured.
Hurry up.
It's boring. Why don't you just a bullet in his head and be done with it.
Hey, you said we were taking him in.
Good morning.
Are these your students?
Hey kids, what'd you learn tonight huh?
What happened to the old crew?
Oh that's right.
They stuck their noses into other people's worlds and got fatally injured.
Now they're The Deletables.
Hey, you hear that kids?
Take note cause that's what you're doing right now.
Let me shut his mouth.
You're talking pretty tough to a guy who's incapacitated, which is good for you.
Is it?
Why don't you cut me loose and I'll open your meat shirt and show you your own heart.
Hey Barney.
Why don't the two of us just end this?
What do you say?
Mix it up, either you snapping my spine or me snapping yours.
You know, make it snappy.
He thinks I'm joking.
I'm not joking.
You should see me when I'm angry.
You'd be very impressed. And very dead.
So, come on pal.
Anything you want to get off your chest. Come on, lay it out.
I'm a good listener.
You're gonna take me back to the has been crew?
Carve me up around a fire. Very tribal.
When we stop, I wanna break every bone in your body.
And drop what's left at The Hague.
The Hague. I finally made the big-time.
I'm a war criminal. Keep laughing.
Do you think, that you can just deliver me like a package?
We were close once.
See we started this whole Expendables thing together, see?
Look I've got the marks.
They're a bit faded but, we had a falling out.
You went dark.
It's a dark business Barney, don't pretend you're not in it.
The baddest survive, those are the rules, I didn't make them up.
You see Barney here was content to work for the small end money.
As an employee.
Now being boss is more lucrative but that's a concept that somehow eluded you.
Plus you got that pesky moral conscience.
God that stuff gets in the way.
He thinks he's the good guy.
Keep talking while you can.
Sure, you got a conscience that makes you weak.
Success, real success... is being willing to do the things that other people are not.
Not everyone's as sick as you.
Oh, but you are.
Did you kill anyone today Barne?
Blow any shit up?
How bout you kids?
Kill anyone?
Before you all start grabbing bricks to stone me at The Hague.
You might want to check your own hands for blood.
But I digress. Where was I?
Yes, business is booming right?
A chopper here, a missile there, guns.
Whatever, when suddenly a competitor.
If you can call Uncle Sam a competitor.
Hires my own team. Barney and the whole gang to whack me.
Things got ugly real fast and a lot of people got dead.
Three former brothers in arms.
- Shut your mouth.
- Three Expendables.
Our brothers, men we ate with, fought with, bled with, dead!
He puts three slugs into my chest.
Thank God... for body armor, even I thought I was dead.
And then he boogies out with the casualties, all dead!
Because you couldn't stay out of my business!
Shut your mouth!
Go on, do it!
- Go on! - It's what he wants.
It's hard to fathom.
I can't believe you forgot.
What?
That it's hard to beat an enemy when he's living inside your own head.
You see you tie me up. Like an animal.
Leave me to the slaughter.
You humiliate me.
Disgrace me. Now when the time comes to kill you.
And it will. I will not use a weapon.
I will use my hands.
Because I want you to feel the way that I feel right now... cause we were brothers.
What's that?
It's a GPS tracker. How about that?
Hold it.
We may need them.
I need a body, find him.
What happened?
We found a shitstorm.
It's gonna getting worse.
This came in for you, 10 minutes ago.
Hey Barney.
My search party's dead so I'm taking it you're still with us.
Now you should've killed me when you had the chance cause that's your last window, and it's gone.
Now, I got something to show you here.
Lida, Harpo, Groucho, Gummo, and Chica.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Hey, give her a little squeeze, there.
Personally, I'd chalk it up to collateral damage, but I don't give a fuck.
But, I know you.
- 48 hours and they're gone for good.
- You want them?
Come get them.
What are you gonna do?
Wow, looking a little strung out there kids.
This is what you get for being pawns in Barney's moral chess game.
That one looks a little slack.
You know I feel most bad for you.
I don't give a shit how you feel.
I do, I have a daughter.
I have feelings, anyway.
You know, when the CIA, I, er presume that's who you're working for.
The CIA, am I right?
I bet you don't even know who you're working for.
But for Barney?
Do you know who he's working for?
Does he know who he's working...
I... It gets very confusing.
Anyway, when the CIA wanted guys doing the dangerous work... in the dangerous places... they called us.
When they didn't want to get their hands dirty... they called us.
Yup, we cleared every hotspot they had.
We bumped the bad guys so that the good guys could roll in looking like heroes.
We killed a lot.
But we saved more lives... than you can possibly imagine.
Then the boys on the hill wanting no loose ends.
Tried to bury me.
I was an American.
Working for America.
Was.
They'd eat their own children.
The lesson here is...
Never do business with the government.
I'm gonna save you that heartache.
You never will.
So you're getting your old team?
Nah, I've burned that bridge.
You know your pride is gonna get you killed.
Better me than them.
- So you're really gonna go back?
- Yeah. - Alone?
- Yeah.
You're an idiot.
Thanks for showing up.
I guess our favors are done.
But you're still an idiot.
How the hell did you find me?
People talk.
I hear things.
You got a mission...
I can help.
My name is Galgo.
Let me fill you in.
I am good, very good.
At warfare.
You know good memory, afraid of nothing.
I want to be your friend.
I don't need a friend.
Yes, you do.
Everybody does.
I don't have any friends That's why I know.
Besides my friendship issues, what I really need now is something to do.
Well, not just anything but... what I was born to do.
Best bet, this is a one way trip.
Excuse me sir, but... one way trip... is better than no way... which is the way I live now.
Help me with the crate.
I'm sorry.
On the plane, Gogo.
On the plane, yes. But Gogo no Gogo, Galgo.
- Galgo.
- Gogo sounds like a Parisian hooker.
I am the bridegroom of death.
The lyrics of a Spanish legion old songs.
That we used to sing when we're on a mission in Croatia.
That's where I met Mingo.
The best point man ever.
Some kind of savant.
You don't know ambush this guy couldn't sniff.
And under fire... the coolest cat ever.
Just pure ice in his veins.
We were pinned down once like two bullets left.
I looked over...
Not one bead of sweat.
Yeah. Can I help you up there?
You're a mechanic now?
Of course I am a mechanic.
I am whatever you need me to be, sir.
OK. Then just be quiet.
Yes, sir. Tiger, This sniper I knew.
I mean, this guy got it all figured out.
Wind speed, temperature... Barometric pressure.
But you know what he said was the most important?
No. Patience. Really?
Yes, he said that.
This thing smells good, what is that?
Kerosene?
Gasoline?
Aviation fuel. Aviation fuel.
It's good.
The best team member ever, his name was Torres.
Holy shit!
You wouldn't believe what this guy was capable to do.
Un...bel...ievable.
I'm telling you, man.
- Galgo?
- Yes, sir. I think I know why your team let you go.
You do?
Really?
Yes.
Last chance. You sure you want to do this?
I like traveling.
Good.
Uh, who are those guys?
My old team.
What the hell are you doing here?
You were stupid enough to get yourself into this mess.
We're the only ones crazy enough to get you out of it.
Come on. We're late for a war.
Galgo you might want to get out of that seat, Christmas is coming.
But it's June.
Galgo, get the hell out.
Yes, sir.
My hat.
I'm curious.
What? Since when did suicide become your hobby?
I got a will.
You know I'm probably the only friend you've got.
I got lots of friends.
You walk into a room, people jump on the tables.
I missed you, Christmas.
I miss you too, you demented bastard.
You could've left it demented.
It's a kind of a solid structure that is taking us from one place to another through unbelievable speeds.
Think about it.
If God... if God... if he would've liked us you know flying.
He would've given us feathers.
Do you have feathers?
Do you have feathers?
- I don't have feathers. - It's gonna be a long ass flight fellas.
It's going to be.
It's going to be a long flight but don't worry...
I'm here, because I can't sleep on planes...
Yeah.
Thought you should know Barney, you're walking into a shitstorm.
NSA ran a signals and frequencies check on your team's phones.
This bastard's not even trying to hide them.
Where has he taken them? They're in Azmanastan.
Another honeymoon hotspot.
Who is that?
Lee Christmas.
Not far off, Christmas.
Stonebanks's compound is where he trains his goons.
It's very heavily fortified.
What's up with the local army?
I don't understand a word this guy is saying.
Local army status.
Small, corrupt.
Stonebanks got all the brass in his pocket.
Been running his operations through this shithole of a country for years.
Want some advice?
- What's the advice?
- What goddamn language is that?
They don't teach you that on the stage either.
Look who's talking. What's the advice Drummer?
Forget about what you're thinking.
Remember our deal.
We need him alive.
So he can sit in a courtroom and beat this on a technicality?
Those are orders, Barney.
- You broke the phone. - I got another one.
Think we'll make it back from this one?
You didn't have to come along, Christmas.
Sure I did.
Morons need friends.
Gentlemen.
Change of plans.
This is it?
This is your evac team?
Short notice.
Yeah. Very short. Where is your team?
Major Drummer?
No team, this one's off the books.
I'm not even here.
Nobody's here.
I thought Church was asshole.
Yeah, hysterical is strength. Weird. Yes, a weird concept.
I mean, if you're hysterically strong... you don't even have to go to the gym.
You are just strong.
You just got it.
You just got it. Hysterical was a concept that actually was applied to women... in the 19th century.
It's a 'dosimonenic' concept. You know what I mean.
Well, this is an interesting place...
He gave me a migraine.
I hear that.
Don't you think?
Look on the bright side.
You run out of bullets, you can talk him to death.
Roger that.
Tall one doesn't like me.
He doesn't like anybody.
- What you say?
- He likes you.
What the hell is that?
What?
That computer strapped to your wrist.
Nothing.
The same thing you were busting that kid's balls about.
Nah, I had it for a while now.
Why'd your team let you go?
Why is it matter now?
I want to know who I'm working with.
They are not around anymore.
So...
This um,
So why'd they let you go?
They didn't.
Benghazi.
I was not in the army anymore.
We were... retrieving a hostage something like uh... like what we are doing here.
It was a beautiful day.
No problems.
And then it all went bad.
We got hit, cut off...
Waited for support, no one came.
Everybody died.
Except me.
Galgo...
Torres and Tiger were right.
You were listening.
Yeah, I was listening.
Thank you.
So what do you think?
I think we should get this over with.
Four signals.
Eight stories up.
This is way too wrong.
Sally don't like it.
You know he's got eyes on us now.
- May I suggest something?
- No.
No, later.
That's what I thought.
That's fine.
Go.
Break it.
What the hell!
Hello, Barney.
I knew you couldn't stay away.
But I'm relieved that someone could pick up the kids.
You got them in there, now try getting them out.
But unfortunately for you...
The entire complex has been wired with C-4.
It'd take a regular Joe about 90 seconds to get out of there. You got, how about 45?
He's turned this whole place into a bomb.
Maybe not.
Hey!
9% battery power?
You didn't charge it?
Excuse me but what are you doing?
Try to run some code, should be able to jam the signal.
Why didn't you think of that? Well I use it to check the weather.
Will you just shut up and let him do his thing?
You sure you're gonna do this Thorn?
I can do it, I can do it.
Come on, man.
Come on, man.
Come on, come on.
Come on, Thorn. Come on.
You're good, come on Thorn.
Focus, focus.
Got it.
Good job, my boy.
We lost override.
The signal is jammed.
Send them in.
Barney the battery's at 8%.
When this thing dies, we lose override.
That gives us about 25 minutes tops.
Don't pop the bottles yet, we still got trouble.
- What?
- Big trouble.
Lucky again bro.
Try to enjoy the view because shortly the building that you're currently standing in will be surrounded by the Azmanastan army.
- How did you shitheads manage to get captured anyway?
- Shut the fuck up!
Step back.
This is not an accident.
And we're trapped in here.
This is exactly what he knew would happen.
Us, tearing at each other.
This stops now.
We can do this.
But only if we do this together.
If we work as a team.
We just may get out of this alive.
Now do you, want to make it work.
That simple. You got any weapons?
Here's the plan. We're gonna break up into small groups.
And go out through the ground floor.
Get ready. Come on.
- Thorn, you stay with me.
- You take Galgo.
Yeah I don't want to. What, what? Shhh...
Don't stop!
One there, one there.
There's too many!
They're on our flank. Bring it to 'em.
That's enough, light them up.
Incoming.
Up the shaft Thorn.
You gotta protect that signal jammer.
I thought you could fight.
Jesus God, you're OK?
Do not worry. I love this. Good keep moving.
Relax.
I told you you'd give yourself a stroke.
You got a tank problem pal.
Do something about it.
I'm on it.
Trench, on your right.
That's gotta hurt.
Drummer's in the house.
Let's go.
Time to pick up the tempo boys.
Look out for the chopper.
Not good.
Hold on.
This is not happening.
You want to do something?
Put me down!
Put me down!
Oh shit!
Hi there.
Closer. Closer.
Yang, hit something.
Next.
Your name is Luna right?
Luna means moon.
Hypnotic, mysterious, magical, like yourself.
Would you like to hold my gun?
Goodbye, sweet.
There he is!
Come on, drive this thing.
This one's for Caesar, assholes.
Yeah!
Damn that's cool.
It was all under control.
That's what it looked like.
Come on!
This the happiest moment of my life.
Jingling jingling.
You finished here?
Men!
- You're not gonna believe this.
- Oh, god. I've been thinking of you the whole time.
- During the whole fight!
- Can we just go?
Come on.
Hold up.
Where did you learn how to fly?
In Tehran.
Warning, we got reinforcements.
Shit.
Drummer, there's another wave coming.
The only way out is up.
On my way.
Evac in 5.
Got it.
Everybody get to the roof now.
Got it.
Trench, Yang, come on, clear the roof.
Let's go.
Damn.
- Always this easy?
- Pretty much. How hard can it be to kill 10 men?
You think you could even just wound a couple?
Watch closely.
And again.
Anybody else?
Useless bunch...
You want something done right...
You got valet parking here?
Yeah, there's some right here.
Go go go.
Don't stop. Come on guys, move it.
Drummer, we're pinned down.
Stop mumbling.
Good morning.
Let's get to the chopper.
Let's go. Go go go go move go.
Go gotta go. - Yang?
- You're welcome.
You're working for Trench?
Yeah, he pay me more money.
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm the guy that just saved your ass.
(Spanish profanity...)
Batteries at 2%.
Hey Barney, leaving so soon?
Come on, let's finish this.
How you feeling?
Come on, stand up, you'll feel better.
Barney where are you?
Lose the armor, I want you to feel this.
Barney we gotta go.
And don't even think about going for that piece of garbage in the bag.
Come on.
That's it.
We don't need these, do we?
Come on.
Barney we gotta go.
Batteries at 1%.
Come on Barney.
What about The Hague huh?
I am The Hague.
Batteries gone.
Gotta go, gotta go.
No don't, wait, wait.
I can't wait.
Go!
Come on, Barney! Go!
What the hell!
You owe me Barney.
Barney!
Pull me up.
You're gonna fire us again, Barney?
Come on!
Can't hear you, pal!
I'm gonna kill you!
Alright, I'm sorry!
- Pull me up you idiots.
To Caeser.
Caeser. Yo Barney. Yeah.
I don't think I'll be needing this anymore. You want your luck back?
I hope I didn't stretch it.
I think you did stretch it.
- Good to have you back man.
- Good to be back. Don't scare us like that anymore, OK.
Hail Caeser.
You never got him to The Hague.
You know Drummer...
Working with you ain't been so bad.
I haven't had so much fun in years.
Fun's important.
These guys are nuts.
Our power's combined...
Yes, you are.
Come on, there must be a plan.
- Woah, Major Old-School.
- Major Badass I'll drink to that.
I am sure I have done enough.
That I am worth my weight, in gold you know...
Am I close?
And since I am as crazy as you...
I am sure I feel game...
- Galgo?
- Yes sir?
Welcome aboard.
Because I already spent a fortune on this.
You know what I mean. I am so happy.
Barney, thank you.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No hugging. - No hugging.
Ooh...
Best two out of three.
- Hey!
- Hey! - Just wanted to say thanks.
For what?
- For caring. - Oh, come on.
- You know, if you were 30 years younger..
- I'd be afraid of you. Cheers.
Hey Yang, looks like you had a growth spurt.
Tall people don't live long.
So you're working for Trench now.
And you, I thought you retired.
I lied.
You guys want to get a room?
So jealous.
We came in this thing together, we gonna leave here together.
Absolutely.
Cheers.
You know for a guy that doesn't take orders very well.
You did pretty good.
Yeah?
So when do I take over?
Keep drinking.
Hey Smilee!
Get over here.
You did good kid.
You look like a proud, demented father.
You could've skipped the demented part.
It was a compliment.
I believe we have a choice in this world about how to tell sad stories.
On the one hand, you can sugarcoat it.
The way they do in movies and romance novels... where beautiful people learn beautiful lessons... where nothing is too messed up that can't be fixed... with an apology and a Peter Gabriel song.
I like that version as much as the next girl does, believe me.
It's just not the truth.
This is the truth.
Sorry.
Late in the winter of my seventeenth year... my mother decided that I was depressed.
She just eats like a bird, she barely leaves the house.
I am not depressed, Mom.
She's reading the same book over and over.
She's depressed.
I'm not depressed.
The booklets and the websites always list depression as a side effect of cancer.
Depression's not a side effect of cancer.
It's a side effect of dying.
Which is what was happening to me.
I may switch you to Zoloft.
Or Lexapro.
And twice a day instead of once.
Why stop there?
Hmm?
Really, just keep them coming.
I'm like the Keith Richards of cancer kids.
Have you been going to that support group I suggested?
Yeah, it's not my thing.
Support groups can be a great way for you to connect with people who are...
Who are...
What?
...on the same journey.
"Journey"?
Really?
Give it a chance.
Who knows, you might even find it enlightening.
All right.
Are you guys ready?
We are gathered here today literally in the heart of Jesus.
We're here with J.C.
Who wants to share their story with the group?
I'm Angel.
I have acute myeloid leukemia.
Sid.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Hi, I'm PJ.
Um, I have neuroblastoma.
I'm Patrick.
Testicular.
I'll spare you the gory details of Patrick's ball cancer.
Basically, they found it in his nuts... they cut most of it out, and he almost died, but he didn't die.
So now, here he is, divorced, friendless... living on his parents' couch... exploiting his cancer-tastic past in the heart of Jesus.
Literally.
To show us that one day, if we 're lucky. ..
We could be just like him.
Who's next?
Hazel?
Um...
I'm Hazel.
Uh, thyroid, originally... but now with quite the impressive satellite colony in my lungs.
And how are you doing?
Uh, you mean besides the terminal cancer?
All right, I guess.
We're here for you, Hazel.
Why don't I play another song?
Christ is our friend
And he'll be there till the end
Christ is our friend
And he'll be there till the end
Christ
Hey, sweet pea.
So... was it awesome?
"Yeah, Mom, it was awesome!"
HAZEL". And that was my life.
Reality shows.
Doctor's appointments.
Eight prescription drugs, three times a day.
But worst, worst, worst of all...
Support group-
- You cannot make me.
- Of course we can.
We're your parents.
Come on, we've been through this.
You need to go.
You need to make friends, and be a teenager.
Mom, if you want me to be a teenager, you don't send me to support group.
You gotta get me a fake ID so that I can go to clubs... and drink gimlets and take pot.
Uh, you don't "take" pot.
Well, that is the kind of thing I would know with a fake ID.
Can you just get in the car, please?
And so I went.
Not because I wanted to, or because I thought it would help me... but for the same reason I did anything these days.
To make my parents happy.
I really don't understand why I can't just drive myself.
It's not like you're gonna do anything.
You're just gonna sit here and wait again.
Of course I'm not.
No, I've got stuff to do.
I'm gonna do errands.
Yeah.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Have fun.
The only thing worse than biting it from cancer... is having a kid bite it from cancer.
Hey!
Make some friends.
Oh, sorry.
I'll take the stairs.
No problem. Thank you.
Sorry.
My bad.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
So, who would like to start?
Does anyone want to start?
Who wants to kick it off?
Go ahead.
I'm Beth.
I have spindle cell sarcoma.
It's been an okay week.
Isaac, I know that you're facing some challenges right now.
Do you want to share with the group?
Or maybe your friend, here?
No, I'll share.
Hey, guys. Uh...
Hi, I'm Isaac.
I have retinoblastoma.
We had surgery on one eye when I was younger... so this is a glass eye.
And then I'm going in to the hospital to have another surgery... to take out the other eye.
So, after that surgery, I'm just gonna be totally blind.
But I'm lucky, because I have this beautiful, smoking hot girlfriend... who's way out of my league.
Monica.
And I have great friends like Augustus Waters to help me out.
So, that's what's up.
Thanks.
We're here for you, Isaac.
Thank you.
Your turn, Gus.
Yeah, sure.
Um, I'm Augustus Waters.
I'm 18 years old and I had a touch of osteosarcoma about a year-and-a-half ago.
So, I've lost this baby as a result.
And, uh, now I'm part cyborg, which is awesome.
But, really, I'm just here at Isaac's request.
And how are you feeling, Gus?
I'm grand, yeah.
I'm on a roller coaster that only goes up, my friend.
Maybe you'd like to share your fears with the group?
My fears?
Oblivion.
Oblivion? Yeah.
You see, I intend to live an extraordinary life.
To be remembered.
So, I'd say if I have any fears, it would be to not do that.
Would anyone else in the group like to speak to that?
Hazel?
Unexpected.
I just want to say that there's gonna come a time when all of us are dead.
There was a time before humans and there's gonna be a time after.
It could be tomorrow, it could be a million years from now.
And when it does, there will be no one left... to remember Cleopatra or Muhammad Ali or Mozart... let alone any of us.
Oblivion's inevitable.
And if that scares you, then I suggest you ignore it.
God knows it's what everyone else does.
Well, that's some good advice.
And I like all this because it's really nice to hear everybody...
Thank you. Mmm-hmm.
Always.
Always.
- Always.
- Always.
"Literally."
I thought we were in a church basement... but apparently we were literally in the heart of Jesus.
Oh, yeah.
What's your name?
Hazel.
No, what's your full name?
Hazel Grace Lancaster.
What?
I didn't say anything.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Because you're beautiful.
Oh, my God.
I enjoy looking at beautiful people.
See, I decided a while back... not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence.
Particularly, as you so astutely pointed out, we're all gonna die pretty soon.
Okay, well, that's great.
But I am not beautiful.
Hey, Gus.
Hi, Lisa.
I like it when you say it first.
I like it when you say it first.
Always.
Always.
What is with the "always"?
"Always" is, like, their thing.
They'll "always" love each other, and whatnot.
They probably texted "always" to each other 14 million times this year.
He's got to be hurting her boob.
Let's go watch a movie.
What?
Hmm?
Huh?
Um...
I'm free later this week, we could...
No, I mean now.
You could be an axe murderer.
There's always that possibility.
Come on, Hazel Grace.
Take a risk.
I don't...
Really?
That is disgusting.
What?
What, do you think that that's cool or something?
You just ruined this whole thing.
The whole thing?
Yes, this whole thing!
Oh, man.
Ugh. And you were doing really well, too.
God!
There's always a hamartia, isn't there?
And yours is even though you had freaking cancer... you're willing to give money to a corporation... for the chance to acquire even more cancer?
Let me just tell you that not being able to breathe sucks!
It totally sucks.
"Hamartia"?
It's a fatal flaw.
Ah, a fatal...
Hazel Grace, they don't actually hurt you unless you light them.
Hmm?
I've never lit one.
It's a metaphor, see?
You put the thing that does the killing right between your teeth... but you never give it the power to kill you.
A metaphor.
Hey, sweetheart.
Is it Top Model time?
No.
Uh...
I've made plans with Augustus Waters.
Whoa!
Oh, my God.
Ooh!
Yeah, I failed my test a couple times.
You don't say.
Actually, the fourth time I took the test, it was going about how this is going.
And when it was over... the instructor looks over at me, and she says...
"Your driving, while unpleasant, is not technically unsafe."
Cancer perk.
Total cancer perk.
So, tell me about you.
Um, I was 13 when they found it.
Pretty much worst-case scenario.
Thyroid, stage four.
Not much they could do.
Which didn't stop them, of course.
Surgery-
Radiation.
Chemo.
More radiation.
All of which worked for a while.
But, then stopped working.
And then one day, my lungs started filling up with water.
Nurse!
We need a nurse right now!
I couldn't breathe.
No one could get it under control.
You can let go, sweetie.
Don't be afraid.
That should have been the end.
Oh, my God.
But then something strange happened.
The antibiotics kicked in.
They drained the fluid from my lungs.
I got some strength back.
Next thing I know, I found myself in an experimental trial.
You know, the ones that are famous in the Republic of Cancervania for not working.
It's called Phalanxifor.
It didn't work in over 70% of the patients... but for some reason it's been working for me.
So, they called it "The Miracle."
Of course, my lungs still suck at being lungs... but, theoretically, they could continue to suck like this... for, I don't know, a while maybe.
So, are you back in school?
I got my GED, so I'm taking classes at MCC.
Whoa!
A college girl!
Well, that explains the aura of sophistication.
Oh!
Careful!
Oops.
Welcome to my humble abode.
Uh, my folks call them "encouragements."
Don't ask.
Hi, guys!
Hey!
Augustus, hi.
New friend?
Yeah.
This is Hazel Grace.
Hey.
Oh, it's just "Hazel."
How's it going, "Just Hazel"?
Hi, Hazel, how are you?
Yeah, we're going downstairs.
Bye. Nice to meet you, too.
This is it.
Augusto World.
This is my room.
Wow.
It's an impressive collection.
Yeah, I used to play.
Do you mind if I sit down?
Yeah.
Make yourself at home.
Mi casa es tu casa.
Sorry, the, um, stairs and the standing...
Yeah, I understand.
Seriously, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
All right.
What's your story?
I already told you.
I was diagnosed when I was 13...
No, no, no.
Not your cancer story, your real story.
Your interests, your hobbies, your passions, your weird fetishes.
"Weird fetishes"?
Think of something.
The first thing that pops in your head.
Something you love.
An Imperial Affliction.
Okay.
What's that?
It's a novel.
It's my favorite novel.
Wait, does it have zombies in it?
Zombies?
No! Stormtroopers?
No, it's not that kind of a book.
Okay, what's it about?
Uh, cancer.
It's about cancer?
But not like that.
Trust me, it's amazing.
The author, his name is Peter Van Houten.
He's the only person I've ever come across in my life... who, A, understands what it's like to be dying... but, B, hasn't actually died.
Okay-
I will read this horrible book with this very boring title... that does not include zombies or Stormtroopers.
And in exchange you will read this.
This haunting, yet brilliant novelization of my favorite video game.
"Counterinsurgence."
Yeah, don't laugh.
It's awesome.
It's about honor, and sacrifice, and bravery, and heroism.
It's about embracing your destiny, and leaving a mark on the world.
Well, thank you.
Wait, your hands are so cold.
Well, they're not so much cold as just under-oxygenated.
Hazel Grace?
Hmm?
I love it when you talk medical to me.
That's different.
Did he give it to you?
By "it," do you mean herpes?
Wow.
Yes, I did.
It's a mother's dream.
Hey, don't worry.
Oh, my God, Mom.
I'm not worried.
It's not a big deal.
Yeah.
We just hung out, it's not like I'm waiting for him to call me.
- Is that what... ?
Yeah- Because I thought those were peppers.
Today, in China,
International Goji Berry Day.
Isn't that great?
I like the color.
Mmm-hmm.
This is the dry.
Uh-huh. Very good.
They're good, right? Mmm-hmm.
So, do they eat a lot of goji berries on Goji Berry Day?
I did something with the dessert... just to try to keep the goji berry theme going.
Because they're an amazing antioxidant.
Well, I like it.
We should do it every year.
Every year.
We should do it every year.
I know.
I really do like these.
Honey, would you like to be excused?
What?
Hazel Grace.
Welcome to the sweet torture of reading An Imperial Affliction.
But now I'm breaking all the rules!
Are you okay?
And now I'm breaking all the rules
Uh...
Me? Yeah, I am excellent.
I am, however, with Isaac, and...
Isaac, does Support Group Hazel make this better or worse?
I've been wasting all my time
Isaac!
Focus on me.
Been wasting all my time
How fast can you get here?
Um...
Great.
Well, the door's open.
I gotta run.
Bye.
Hello?
Hazel.
Isaac, Hazel Grace from the Support Group is here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Uh...
A gentle reminder...
Isaac's in the midst of a psychotic episode right now.
You look really nice, by the way.
I like this color on you.
Thank you.
Isaac.
Isaac, Hazel's here.
Hey, Isaac.
Hey, Hazel.
How you doing?
I'm doing okay.
It seems Isaac and Monica are no longer a going concern.
Oh, Isaac, I'm so sorry.
Do you want to talk about it?
No, I just want to cry and play video games.
However, you know, it doesn't hurt to talk to him... if you have any sage words of feminine advice.
I actually think that his response is fairly appropriate.
"Pain demands to be felt."
You're quoting my book.
She said she wanted to break up with me before the surgery... because she couldn't handle it.
I'm about to lose my eyesight, and she can't handle it.
I kept saying "always" to her.
Like, "Always."
And she kept talking over me and not saying it back, and...
It was like I was gone already, you know?
You know, sometimes... people don't understand the promises that they're making when they make them.
I know, but...
I feel like such a loser.
I still have her necklace on.
Take it off.
Dude, take that off.
Yeah.
Here we go, man.
Here we go.
I just want to kick something.
Don't hit that, don't hit that.
Uh...
Hit this.
Sorry.
I've been wanting to call you for a few days now... but I've been waiting until I could form a coherent thought about An Imperial Affliction.
One second.
Isaac.
Pillows don't break.
You need to break something.
Try this.
The trophy?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
I've been looking for a way to tell my father I kind of hate basketball.
Go to town!
Always!
An Imperial Affliction.
Yes.
I'm so glad that you liked it.
Yes, I did.
But the ending.
I know.
It is rather abrupt.
"Rather abrupt"?
Are you kidding?
It's evil!
I mean, I understand that she dies... but there's an unwritten contract between author and...
Gus?
Yeah?
Cool?
Sure.
Between author and reader.
And I feel like ending your book in the middle of a sentence... violates that contract, don't you think?
Okay, yes.
I know what you mean... but, to be completely honest,
I think it's just so truthful.
You just die in the middle of life.
You die in the middle of a sentence.
And, I don't know...
But I really would like to know what happens to everyone after Anna dies.
Like Anna's mother.
Yes, and the Dutch Tulip Man.
And Sisyphus the Hamster.
Yes!
Have you tried contacting this Peter Van Houten fellow?
I've written him so many letters, but he's never responded.
Apparently, he moved to Amsterdam and became a recluse, and...
Shame.
Yeah.
Isaac".
You feeling better, buddy?
That's the thing about pain.
It demands to be felt.
I'll help you clean this up.
Hazel Grace.
Augustus Waters.
I cannot stop thinking about this goddamn book.
You're welcome.
However, we do need closure, don't you think?
That is exactly what I was asking
Van Houten for in my letters.
But he never responded.
Um, nope.
"Dear Mr. Waters...
"I am writing to thank you for your electronic correspondence.
"I am grateful to anyone who sets aside the time...
"to read my book."
Augustus?
Yes?
What are you doing?
I may have found...
Van Houten's assistant, emailed her.
Augustus!
She may have forwarded that email on to Van Houten.
Shall I continue?
Oh, my God.
Yeah, go, go, go!
"I am particularly indebted to you, sir."
Hazel Grace, he just called me "sir."
Augustus, keep reading, keep reading!
"Both for your kind words about An Imperial Affliction...
"and for taking the time...
"to tell me that the book, and here I quote you directly...
"'meant a great deal to you and your friend Hazel Grace.".
You did not!
You did not!
You did not, you did not!
Of course I did.
"To answer your question, no, I have not written anything else, nor will I.
"I do not feel like continuing to share my thoughts with readers...
"would benefit either them or me.
"However, thank you...
"for your generous email.
"Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten."
So, yeah, that just happened.
Oh, my God.
I've been trying to tell you, I'm kind of awesome.
Do you think that I...
Check your inbox.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Augustus.
I'm freaking out.
I'm freaking out.
Dear Mr. Peter Van Houten, my name is Hazel Grace Lancaster.
My friend Augustus Waters... who read your book at my recommendation... just received an email from you at this address.
I hope you will not mind that he shared that email with me.
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind answering a few questions I have... about what happens after the end of the book.
Specifically the following.
Does Anna's mom marry the Dutch Tulip Man?
And is the Dutch Tulip Man up to something... or is he just completely misunderstood?
Lastly, I was hoping you could shed some light on Sisyphus the Hamster.
These questions have haunted me for years... and I don't know how long I have left to get answers to them.
I know that these are not important literary questions...
"and that your book is full of important literary questions...
"but I would just really like to know.
"And, of course, if you ever do decide to write anything else...
"I would love to read it.
"Frankly, I'd read your grocery lists.
"Yours, with great admiration, Hazel Grace Lancaster."
Not bad.
You think?
Yeah, I mean, it's a bit pretentious... but then again, Van Houten uses words like "tendentious"
and "Bacchanalia, " so...
I think he'll like it.
Is it really 1:00 AM?
Is it?
Yeah, I guess it is.
I should probably go to sleep.
Okay-
Okay-
Okay-
Okay-
Perhaps "okay" will be our "always."
Okay-
Oh, my God.
"Dear Ms. Lancaster...
"I cannot answer your questions, at least not in writing...
"because to do so would constitute a sequel...
"which you might publish or otherwise share on the internet.
"Not that I don't trust you, but how could I trust you?
"I barely know you.
"Should ever you find yourself in Amsterdam,
"do pay a visit at your leisure."
What?
"Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten."
Oh, my God!
What is this life?
Hazel?
Mom!
Hazel, what's wrong?
Mom, look at this.
Come here.
Come here, come here.
Look.
What?
Yeah. Peter Van Houten!
Look what he said!
"Should ever you find yourself in Amsterdam"!
I have to go!
That's incredible.
He invited us to Amsterdam.
Amsterdam!
Wow!
Can We go?
I mean, do you think we could actually go?
I mean, Amsterdam!
I want you to have everything you want in the world.
But we don't have the money, you know?
Just getting all the equipment over there.
How do we do that?
Yeah, duh. I'm sorry.
Hey, you, I am so sorry.
It's okay.
Why don't you just ask the Genies?
Use your wish. I already used it.
Pre-Miracle.
What'd you use it on?
Not Disney.
Hazel Grace, you did not go to Disney World.
You did not use your last dying wish...
I was 13. ...to go to Disney World.
And Epcot Center.
Oh, my God.
It was actually a really fun trip!
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
I met Goofy! Now I'm just embarrassed.
Why are you embarrassed?
I can't believe I have a crush on a girl with such cliche wishes.
Terrible.
You coming?
The most important thing in any MRI... is to lie completely still.
But that day, it was almost impossible.
Hey, Gus!
How are you?
Hi, Mrs. Lancaster.
Hey.
Rik Smits jersey?
Yeah, it is indeed.
I loved that guy. I'm Augustus Waters.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Michael.
It's good to see you.
Hi, Mrs. Lancaster.
Good to see you.
Hi, Hazel Grace.
Hi.
How would you like to go on a picnic with me?
Um, I would love to go on a picnic with you.
Shall we?
No.
Let me...
I smell like hospital, so I should just change.
So, uh... you're a survivor yourself, huh?
Yeah.
I didn't cut this fellow off for the hell of it.
Although it does make an excellent weight-loss strategy.
Legs are very heavy.
How's your health now?
It's great.
NEC for 14 months.
Really?
Yeah. That's fantastic.
Yeah.
I'm very lucky.
Hey, listen, Gus.
You have to understand, Hazel's still pretty sick.
And she will be the rest of her life.
And she's gonna want to keep up with you.
She's that kind of girl.
But the truth is, her lungs... Ready, Gus?
Yeah.
All right.
See you soon.
All right.
Oh!
Such a beautiful day.
Yeah.
Is this where you take all of your romantic conquests?
Every last one of them.
That's probably why I'm still a virgin.
You are not still a virgin.
Are you really?
Let me show you something.
See this circle?
That is a circle of virgins.
Uh-huh.
And this... is 18-year-old dudes with one leg.
Oh...
So, yeah.
Funky Bones by Jeep Van Lieshout.
He sounds quite Dutch.
And he is.
Much like Rik Smits.
And tulips.
Sandwich?
Let me guess.
Dutch cheese and tomato.
Sorry, the tomatoes are Mexican.
How dare you!
Hmm.
How cool is this?
They're using a skeleton as a playground.
Think about that.
You do love your symbols.
Speaking of which, you're probably wondering... why you're sitting here eating a bad cheese sandwich... and drinking orange juice with a guy in a Rik Smits jersey.
It actually has crossed my mind.
Well, Hazel Grace, like so many before you... and listen, I say this with the utmost of affection... you used your wish moronically.
Okay, we've been through this.
I was 13.
Hush! lam in the midst of a grand soliloquy, here.
You were young, impressionable... the Grim Reaper staring you right in the face... and it led you to rush into making a wish you didn't really want.
But, how could little Hazel Grace, having never read An Imperial Affliction... know that her one true wish was to visit Mr. Peter Van Houten... in his Amsterdam exile.
But I didn't save it, so...
It's a good thing I saved mine.
So, you're saying...
I'm not gonna give you my wish or anything, Hazel.
If that's what you're thinking.
However...
I, too, have an interest in meeting this Mr. Peter Van Houten... and I don't really think it would make much sense... to meet him without the girl who introduced me to the book in the first place... now, would it?
So I talked to the Genies, and they're all for it.
We leave in a month.
No.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Augustus!
Thank you!
I don't know if they do this that often, but they're willing to bring me, too, and...
That's incredible.
Hazel, that's so beautiful.
I know.
And a little insane.
Oh, it's super insane.
It's...
It's...
It's... It's crazy!
Well...
It's Amsterdam!
He just met you...
I know!
...and he's giving you his wish.
Well, we're sharing the wish.
We're...
I mean, he...
He... Yeah. We're sharing it.
That's sweet.
Unless...
What?
Is he your boyfriend?
Is that...
Stop it!
Do not... He is not my...
Mom, focus, we're talking about Amsterdam.
I like him so much.
I...
Stop.
Pay attention.
Please! Can I go?
Right, as your mom, I love this idea.
And I...
I think we should talk to Dr. Maria.
Okay-
I don't know.
But you said that the PET scan was encouraging.
Well, the PET scan is encouraging, but we don't know how long it will stay that way.
Okay, I'm not seeking political asylum.
It's a few days.
It's a vacation!
It's true. What if you get sick?
In a foreign country?
They have doctors in Amsterdam.
And cancer.
Well, not all cancers are alike, and yours is particularly unusual, Hazel.
The only way I could ever authorize a trip like this would be if someone familiar with your case...
What if my mom came?
Wait, what?
What if you came?
I'm...
I'm sure the Genies would hook it up.
They're loaded.
That just might work.
HAZEL". And then this happened.
Hey-
Hi.
Hey.
You're okay.
So, what happened?
The usual.
Fluid in the lungs preventing oxygenation.
They put a tube in.
They drained a liter and a half last night.
The good news is... no tumor growth.
No new tumors in your body.
We're so relieved.
This is just a thing, Hazel.
It's a thing we can live with.
Mr. Lancaster.
How's she doing?
Better.
Yeah, thank you.
Much, much better.
Uh, they won't let me in.
It's family only.
Yeah, sorry.
Yeah, I get it.
Um...
Could you just tell her I was here?
Yeah, of course.
Of course I will.
Okay.
Gus, listen, why don't you go home?
Get some rest.
Okay-
Normally, the tumors start resisting the treatment... and that hasn't happened here...
Yet.
On the other hand... the drug may be worsening the edema.
The truth is... very few people have been on Phalanxifor as long as Hazel has.
We really don't know the long-term effects.
What we're trying to do is prevent endothelial growth... which, when overexpressed, can contribute to disease, decay... vascular inhibition... and the spread of the tumors we're working so hard to eradicate.
The survival rate of patients with severe endothelial growth... decreases exponentially the more the condition advances.
You can let go, sweetie.
Don't be afraid.
Oh, my God.
I'm not gonna be a mom anymore.
I have a question.
Yes, Hazel?
Can I still go to Amsterdam?
That would not be wise at this juncture.
Why not?
ls there any way we can make that trip happen?
It would increase some risks.
But so does going to the mall.
Yes, but an airplane?
But they have oxygen on airplanes.
You're stage four.
This is an opportunity that I may never get again.
Even
If the medication is working, I don't understand why I can't...
Perhaps there's a scenario...
No.
I don't know any other way to say this, Hazel.
You're just too sick.
I'm sorry.
MICHAEL; Hello?
Yeah, just a sec.
Hi.
Gus... again.
Sorry, she's asleep.
Yeah. Uh, okay.
All right.
Bye-bye.
I know what you're thinking.
It's not fair to him.
It's not.
He doesn't need this in his life.
Nobody does.
A lot more trouble than it's worth.
No, you're right.
Your mom and I were just saying the same thing.
I mean, it could be time we tossed you out on the street.
Drop you off in an orphanage somewhere, make you their problem.
I'm serious.
We're not sentimental people.
Hazel Grace.
Hi, Augustus.
Are you okay?
No.
What's the matter?
Talk to me.
I don't know.
Everything.
I want to go to Amsterdam, Gus.
And I want Van Houten to tell us what happens after his book.
I also don't really want this particular life.
I mean, it's really just the sky.
The sky is making me sad.
And there's this pathetic old swing set... that my dad built for me when I was a kid and...
It's just everything, I guess.
Well, I demand to see this swing set of tears.
I do see your point.
This is one sad swing set.
Hazel Grace, I hope you realize... that you trying to keep your distance from me in no way lessens my affection for you.
All your efforts to keep me from you are gonna fail.
Look. Uh...
I like you.
And I like hanging out with you and everything... but I can't let this go on any further.
Why not?
Because I don't want to hurt you.
I wouldn't mind.
No, you don't understand.
I do understand. You don't understand.
I know what you're trying to say.
Hazel, I'm saying I wouldn't mind.
It'd be a privilege to have my heart broken by you.
Gus, I'm a grenade.
One day I'm gonna explode... and I'm gonna obliterate everything in my wake and...
I don't know, I feel like it's my responsibility... to minimize the casualties.
A grenade?
I mean, that's why I don't have a hamster.
Well, we gotta do something about this frickin' swing set.
Okay-
"Swing set needs home."
"Desperately lonely swing set
"needs loving home."
"Lonely, vaguely pedophilia swing set
"seeks the butts of children."
No.
No.
No?
No?
I like it.
That's why.
In case you're wondering, that's why I like you, Hazel Grace.
You're just so busy being you, you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are.
You can't say stuff like that.
What? That's howl speak to all my friends.
I know, I know.
Friends.
Friends.
Friends! You can't do that!
"Dear Hazel, received word via the Genies that you will...
"you'll be visiting us with Augustus Waters
"and your mother on the fourth."
Mom?
Yeah?
Mom!
What's wrong?
Sorry.
No, I was just taking a bath.
Did you email the Genies to tell them that the trip was off?
Because Van Houten's assistant just emailed me... and she said that she thinks we're still coming.
What?
I was supposed to tell you with your dad.
Mom.
We're going to Amsterdam.
You're se-...
We're going to Amsterdam?
We're going to Amsterdam.
We figured the whole thing out.
We're going.
Doctor Maria, everybody knows.
But only for three days, not six.
Oh, my God.
But everything. An oncologist is set there.
Everything.
We're just so good.
I love you.
I love you so much.
I love you.
Here, sit down. We're going to Amsterdam.
We're going to Amsterdam.
We're going to Amsterdam.
You can come talk to me. You've got a phone call to make.
Call him!
Okay, lungs, you keep your shit together for one week.
You got it?
One more week.
Oh. Oh, wait, the food.
What did you forget?
Do you have my passport?
Yeah, I've got it.
It's like I said to the Genies...
"I travel in style, or I don't travel at all."
Mom, we're going to Amsterdam!
We are going to Amsterdam, right now.
Hello, Lancasters.
Gus.
Hey. Nice to see you.
I'll take that, sir.
Gus, you're so inventive!
Okay, Hazel Grace?
Okay!
What's in your nose?
Jackie!
I'm really sorry about that.
No, it's totally fine.
It's called a "cannula." And it helps me breathe.
See this little friend right here?
He feeds oxygen through your tube.
Will it help me breath, too?
Maybe.
Do you want to try it?
Okay-
Come here.
There ya go.
It tickles!
Wow, yeah, that's something.
I think I'm breathing better.
I would love to give it to you, but I kind of could use the help.
Thanks for letting me try it.
You're welcome.
All right, Jackie, let's go.
Thank you.
Take care.
Bye. Flight 1721 is now prepared to begin boarding at gate 46...
I think that's us.
That's us.
We are going to Amsterdam!
Oh, my God.
Come on, help me.
What, are they wet?
Wet hands.
I'm sorry about that.
Gross! Get outta here!
Stop it!
Have you never been on a plane before?
No.
It's exciting.
Sir?
Uh-huh?
There's no smoking on this plane.
Or any plane.
I don't smoke.
Yeah, it's just a metaphor.
He puts the killing thing in his mouth... but he doesn't actually give it the power to kill him.
Well, that metaphor, it's prohibited on today's flight.
Flight attendants, prepare for take off, please.
Thanks.
Okay?
Gus, this is what it's like to drive in a car with you.
Ha-ha-ha-ha...
Oh...
Oh!
Oh, my God, we're flying.
We're flying!
Look at the ground!
Look.
Nothing has ever looked like this in all of human history!
Look at the cars.
They're like...
You two are so adorable.
We're just friends.
Well, she is, I'm not.
Oh, my!
Whoa!
Get away from her, you bitch!
Look at this, Hazel.
This is so crazy.
Whoa.
What?
Look at the stained glass.
It's amazing.
Oh, I'm gonna check us in.
We better get you dressed... because you have reservations for two tonight, for dinner at Oranjee.
Oh.
And it says, "Enjoy.
Mr. Peter Van Houten."
So, I looked it up and it sounds amazing.
The guide book says it's fancy and very romantic.
Right.
Fancy...
Oh, God.
But, okay, what will you wear?
Is that for me?
Oh, my God.
It's so beautiful.
I'm just saying.
You're just saying?
What, you're saying that you're totally fine... with your teenage daughter running free with an older boy... in a city that's famous for its vice and debauchery is totally fine with you?
Yeah, that's pretty much exactly what I'm saying.
Gus!
Oh, you look so handsome!
Thank you, ma'am.
Wow.
Hazel, Gus is here... looking incredible!
I hear this restaurant is unbelievable.
Wow.
What?
You look gorgeous.
Thanks.
Whoa!
Wow.
This is it.
Oranjee.
Yeah, this is it.
Oh, yeah.
Your table, Mr. and Mrs. Waters.
Thank you.
Thanks, Gus.
You are very welcome.
The champagne is our gift.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
Good evening.
Voilà.
Okay, Okay?
Whoa.
That is amazing.
Do you know what Dom Pérignon said after he invented champagne?
"Come quickly," he said. "I'm tasting the stars."
Welcome to Oranjee.
Would you like a menu, or will you have the chef's choice?
Chef's choice sounds wonderful.
- Mmm.
- And, sir, um... something tells me we're gonna need a little bit more of this.
We have bottled all the stars for you this evening, my young friends.
- Ooh!
- I think that's ours.
Dragon carrot risotto for the lady.
Thank you.
And for the gentleman.
Thank you.
I want this dragon carrot risotto to become a person... so that I can take it to Vegas and marry it.
I like your suit.
Thank you.
It's the first time I've ever worn it.
That's not the suit you wear to funerals?
No.
That one is not nearly this nice.
When I first got sick... they told me I had an 85 percent chance of being cancer-free.
Great odds.
But that meant a year of torture, the loss of my leg... and, still, a 15 percent chance it might fail.
Just before the surgery...
I asked my parents if I could buy a really nice suit.
So, it's your death suit.
That's what it is.
I have one of those.
I got it for my fifteenth birthday.
A dress.
I don't necessarily think I'd wear it on a date, though.
So, we're on a date?
Hey, you watch it.
We are Mr. And Mrs. Waters.
Oh. That's just because she can't speak English.
We should be, though, if they ask.
You know?
Remember what you said about Vegas?
Yeah.
Do you think I could join in on that deal?
God?
Maybe.
How about angels?
Mmm, no.
Afterlife?
Mmm... No.
Well, maybe. I don't know.
I guess I wouldn't go as far as to say "no"... but I would like some evidence.
What about you?
Absolutely.
Really?
I mean, not like a heaven where you ride on a unicorn all day... and live in a mansion made of clouds... but yes, I definitely believe in something.
I mean, otherwise... what's the point?
Maybe there is no point.
I won't accept that.
I am in love with you.
You heard me.
Augustus...
I am in love with you.
And I know that love is just a shout into the void... and that oblivion is inevitable.
And that we're all doomed... and that one day... all of our labors will be returned to dust.
And I know that the sun will swallow the only Earth we will ever have.
And I am in love with you.
Sorry.
More stars?
No, thank you.
I think we'll just have the check.
No, sir.
Your meal has been paid by Mr. Van Houten.
What?
I don't really get that shirt.
Mmm.
But Van Houten will get it.
There are, like, fifty Magritte references in An Imperial Affliction.
"This is not a pipe."
But it is a pipe.
But it's not.
It is a drawing of a pipe.
See?
A drawing of a thing is not the thing itself.
Nor is a T-shirt of a drawing of a thing, the thing itself.
Hey, you.
When did you get so grown up?
Who's ready for some answers?
Me!
This is it.
I'm so excited, I can barely breathe.
As opposed to normal?
Get out of here.
Lidewij?
Hi!
Hi, I'm Augustus.
Lidewij.
Hazel.
Please, come in.
Thank you.
Peter!
They're here!
Who the hell is "they," Lidewij?
They are Augustus and Hazel... the young fans with whom you've been corresponding.
The Americans?
You invited them.
Please, come in.
You know why I left America, Lidewij.
To never have to encounter Americans.
You're American.
Incurably so.
Get rid of them.
I will not do this, Peter.
Please, be nice.
Come in, please.
Sorry, let me clear this for you.
Thank you.
Which of you is Augustus Waters?
I am.
And that's Hazel.
Mr. Van Houten, thank you so much for writing back to us.
Clearly an error in judgment.
Yours are the first missives to which I've replied, and look where it got me.
Scotch?
Uh...
No, thank you.
Just me, then, Lidewij.
Another scotch and soda, please.
Perhaps some breakfast first, Peter?
She thinks I have a drinking problem.
I also think the Earth is round.
So, you like my book.
We love your book.
Yeah. We love it.
Augustus...
He made his wish meeting you so that we could talk.
- No pressure.
- Yeah.
Did you dress like her on purpose?
Kind of.
And, incidentally, sir, we both really wanted to thank you for dinner last night.
And for the champagne.
It was amazing.
It was magical.
We bought them dinner last night?
It was our pleasure.
You've come a long way.
What can I do for you?
We have some questions... obviously, about what happens at the end of your book.
Uh, specifically to those who Anna leaves behind.
Like her mom, the Dutch Tulip Man...
How familiar are you with Swedish hip-hop?
I would say, limited.
Uh, Lidewij, play Bomfalleralla immediately.
Okay-
We don't speak Swedish, sir.
Who the hell speaks Swedish?
The important thing is not what nonsense the voices are saying... but what the voices are feeling.
Are you messing with us?
Like, is this some sort of performance?
Gus, sit down.
All right, so at the end of the book, Anna's...
Let's imagine you're racing a tortoise.
The tortoise has a ten-yard head start.
In the time it takes you to run ten yards... the tortoise has moved maybe one yard, and so on, forever.
You're faster than the tortoise, but you can never catch him, you see?
You can only decrease his lead.
Now, certainly, you can run past the tortoise... as long as you don't contemplate the mechanics involved.
But the question of "how?"
turns out to be so complicated... that no one really solved it... until Cantor's proof that some infinities are bigger than other infinities.
I assume that answers your question.
Hazel, I'm sorry.
I have no idea what's going on.
Yet you seemed so intelligent in print, Mr. Waters.
Has the cancer found its way into your brain?
Peter.
Can we, for one second, just focus on Anna?
Please?
I understand that the story ends in the middle of a sentence... because she dies, or that she becomes too sick to continue...
I am not interested in talking about that book.
But that doesn't mean that her family and friends don't have a future, right?
I said I'm not interested.
But you promised!
Nothing happens!
They're fiction!
They cease to exist the moment the novel ends.
But they can't!
I get it in a literary sense or whatever, but...
I can't do this, Lidewij.
It's impossible not to imagine what...
I will not indulge your childish whims.
I refuse to pity you in the manner in which you are accustomed.
I do not want your pity!
VAN Of course you do!
Like all sick kids, your existence depends on it.
You are fated to live out your days...
Peter! ...as the child you were when diagnosed.
A child who believes there is a life after a novel ends.
And we as adults, we pity this.
So, we pay for your treatments, your oxygen machines.
Peter, that's enough.
You are a side-effect to an evolutionary process... that cares little for individual lives.
You are a failed experiment in mutation.
Listen, douchepants... there is nothing that you're gonna tell me about my disease... that I don't already know.
I came here for one thing and one thing only.
That is for you to tell me what happens at the end of this goddamn book!
I can't tell you.
Bullshit!
I can't. Then make something up!
I want you to leave.
Have you ever stopped to ask yourself... why you care so much about your silly questions?
Oh, go fuck yourself.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
I'll write you a sequel.
All right? I'll write you a sequel.
It'll be better than any piece of shit that drunk guy could write.
It'll have blood, and guts, and sacrifice.
You'll love it.
So sorry that I spent your wish on that asshole.
No, you did not spend it on him.
You spent it on us.
Hazel and Augustus!
I'm very sorry.
Circumstance has made him cruel.
I thought meeting you would help him... that he could see that his work has shaped real lives.
But...
I'm very sorry.
Perhaps we can do some sightseeing?
Have you been to the Anne Frank house?
I'm not going anywhere with that man.
No.
He is not invited.
I'm afraid there's no elevator.
Oh. That's all right.
There are many stairs.
Steep stairs.
I can do it. Hazel, we don't have to...
I can do it.
Let's go.
Frank's family came from Frankfurt, in Germany.
Anne Frank's diary would become world famous.
It's difficult in times like these.
It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals.
They seem so absurd and impractical... yet I cling to them because I still believe... in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.
It's utterly impossible for me to build my life...
Shall we?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Hazel, I'll carry it if you want.
I got it.
Wow.
So this is the actual bookcase that hid the Frank family.
Whoa.
I got it.
Thank you.
We're much too young to deal with these problems... but they keep thrusting themselves on us... until, finally, we're forced to think up a solution.
You okay, Hazel?
Yeah.
Don't worry, take your time.
Sorry.
Yeah?
Yeah.
And yet, when I look up at the sky...
I somehow feel that everything will change for the better.
That this cruelty, too, will end.
You Okay?
Yeah.
Hazel, I think that's enough.
You don't need...
You know? Uh-huh.
I got this.
All is as it should be.
God wishes to see people happy.
Where there is hope...
Hazel.
...there is life.
Well done.
Yeah.
You Okay?
Yeah.
This is it, look.
All right?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God.
Thanks.
The only member of the Frank family to survive was Otto.
Anne's father.
At such moments I can't think about the misery... but about the beauty that still remains.
Try to recapture the happiness within yourself.
Think of all the beauty in everything around you... and be happy.
Bravo.
I fell in love with him the way you fall asleep.
Slowly, and then all at once.
It just sort of ends right above where the knee would be... and tapers off.
What?
My leg.
You know, just so you're prepared.
Gus... get over yourself.
Wait.
I can't, it's stuck.
I love you so much, Augustus Waters.
I love you too, Hazel Grace.
So, so much.
Augustus, I can't breathe.
It's okay.
Hazel.
You're so beautiful.
Stop.
No, you're so beautiful.
I'm so lucky.
I'm so lucky.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe you called him "douchepants."
- I know!
- You did?
How did you come up with that?
I don't know, it just came out.
I was so angry.
What a monster.
Mom, it was awful.
Then what happened?
We went to Anne Frank House.
Oh, you did?
It was really awesome.
Was that incredible? It was so awesome.
And after that?
We just walked around.
That sounds lovely.
Oh, my gosh, we probably still have a few hours, right?
Should we go to the Van Gogh Museum?
Whatever you want.
Probably don't have time to do everything, but...
You're just gonna have to come back, is all.
Could you just not be ridiculous right now, please?
Hazel, I'm not being ridiculous.
I'm being positive.
Mrs. Lancaster?
Yeah?
Do you think Hazel and I can just have a little time alone?
Sure, Gus.
Um, lam gonna run to the room... and be ready whenever you guys want to do something.
Want to go for a walk?
What is it?
Just before you went into the hospital, there was this...
I felt an ache in my hip.
So, I had a PET scan... and it lit up like a Christmas tree.
The lining of my chest and my liver...
Everywhere.
I'm sorry.
I should've told you.
It's so unfair.
Apparently, the world is not a wish-granting factory.
Hey, listen.
Don't you worry about me, Hazel Grace, okay?
I'm gonna find a way to hang around here and annoy you for a long time.
Are you in pain?
No.
I'm okay.
You're okay?
Okay-
I don't suppose you can just forget about this?
You know, just treat me like I'm not dying.
I don't think you're dying, Augustus.
You've just got a touch of cancer.
Would it be absolutely ludicrous... if we just made out?
Right now?
Probably.
On...
So how are your eyes, Isaac?
They're good.
They're not in my head, is the only problem.
Besides that...
Well, um, it appears my entire body's made out of cancer now.
So, sorry to one-up you, dude.
Did you, uh...
write his eulogy yet?
Dude.
What?
What? I haven't told her yet, Isaac.
What are you talking about?
Oh.
Sorry.
Augustus?
I need speakers at my funeral.
So, I was hoping that you and Isaac, but mostly you... would be, um, kind enough to whip something up.
I would love to do that.
Thank you.
You guys are cute.
Makes me sick.
You guys are gross.
Have you heard from Monica?
Nope, not a thing.
She hasn't even texted you to make sure you're okay?
Not once.
I hate that girl.
But there are tons of other girls.
You guys don't have to worry about me.
In support group, there's this new girl... and she has these humongous...
How do you even know that?
I'm blind, but I'm not that blind.
Hazel Grace?
Hmm.
Do you happen to have five dollars?
Okay, so, now what?
Hey, guys?
I smell eggs.
That eggs?
Is it there?
It's there.
Mmm-hmm.
I'm nervous.
Nervous?
Is Monica in there?
It doesn't matter where Monica is.
This is not about Monica.
This is about you.
Hazel Grace... egg me.
Egged.
Isaac.
All right, here we go.
- You got this.
- All right. Come on.
I didn't hear anything.
It's all right.
A little more to your left.
Wait, throw to my left, or should I aim a little left?
Aim left. Okay.
Left-er.
Gus, I think we should wait until dark.
It's all dark to Isaac.
Dude, I'm not deaf.
I'm just blind.
So I can hear when you make fun of my disability.
I'm sorry. And I don't love it.
Where do I throw?
Just throw hard.
Yes.
Yes!
Yeah!
What?
What?
I hit it! I hit it!
Now I know exactly where to line it up.
That was so exhilarating!
Keep it going- Keep going-
Keep throwing, keep throwing.
Give me more, give me more, give me more!
Oh!
Oh, Stop, stop, stop!
Isaac.
Oh.
Hello.
Are you Monica's mother?
I am.
Hello, ma'am.
Your daughter, she's done a great injustice.
So we've come here seeking revenge.
You see, we may not look like much... but between the three of us, we have five legs, four eyes... and two-and-a-half working pairs of lungs.
But we also have two dozen eggs... so if I were you, I would go back inside.
Dude, it actually worked?
Yep. That was the stupidest speech I've ever...
That actually worked?
There you go.
Hold on.
This feels so good!
Augustus?
Hazel Grace.
Hi.
Oh, my God.
Hi, hi. I love you.
I'm at the gas station.
You're what?
Something is wrong.
You gotta...
Can you come?
Can you come and help me?
Gus!
Gus.
Babe, what's going on?
Look.
Gus, it's infected.
Take a deep breath.
Gus, I have to call somebody.
No, no.
Please don't call 9-1-1.
Please. Don't call my parents or 9...
I will never forgive you if you call them.
Gus, what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I wanted to buy cigarettes.
I don't know what happened to my pack.
I might have lost it or something, or they took it, but I just...
I wanted to do something for myself, you know?
I wanted to do it myself.
I have to call 9-1-1.
No! I have to.
No!
Hi, 9-1-1?
Um, we need an ambulance.
I hate myself!
My name is Hazel Grace Lancaster.
Please hurry.
We're in a silver Jeep at the gas station.
I wish I could say that Augustus Waters kept his sense of humor until the end.
That not for a single moment did his courage waver.
But that is not what happened.
It hurts so much.
I'm so stupid.
Baby, it's okay.
Hazel?
Will you tell me a story?
A story?
Or, like, a poem?
I do know...
I... I know a poem.
Will you tell me it?
The Red Wheelbarrow by William Carlos Williams.
"So much depends upon a red wheelbarrow
"Glazed with rain water
"beside the white chickens."
That's it?
Is that all?
No, no, no, of course not.
Of course not.
"So much depends upon...
A blue sky
"Cut open by the branches of trees
"And so much depends upon the... The transparent G-tube
"erupting from the belly of the blue-lipped boy
"So much depends
"on this observer of the universe"
How's he doing?
He's had a tough night, Hazel.
His blood pressure's low.
His heart...
What about the chemo?
They are gonna stop the chemo.
Can I see him?
We'll tell him you were here.
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
I'm just gonna hang out for a while, if you don't mind.
Yeah, of course.
Take your time.
Here we go, bud.
Good?
All right, sweetie.
Okay-
Hi.
What are you thinking about?
Oblivion.
I know it's kid's stuff or whatever, but...
I always thought I would be a hero.
I always thought I'd have a grand story to tell.
You know, something they would publish in all the papers, and...
I mean, I was supposed to be special.
You are special, Augustus.
Yeah, I know.
But... you know what I mean.
I do know what you mean, I just don't agree with you.
You know this obsession you have with being remembered?
Don't get mad.
I am mad.
I'm mad because I think you're special.
And is that not enough?
You think that the only way to lead a meaningful life... is for everyone to remember you, for everyone to love you.
Guess what, Gus.
This is your life, okay?
This is all you get.
You get me, and you get your family, and you get this world, and that's it.
And if that's not enough for you, then I'm sorry, but it's not nothing.
Because I love you.
And I'm gonna remember you.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
I just wish you would be happy with that.
Hey-
It's a good life, Hazel Grace.
It's not over yet, you know.
Oh, Augustus.
One of the less bullshitty conventions of the cancer genre... is the convention known as the "Last Good Day"... when it seems like the inexorable decline has suddenly plateaued... when the pain is, just for a minute, bearable.
The problem, of course, is that there's no way of knowing... that your last good day is your last good day.
At the time, it's just another decent day.
Hello, Augustus.
Good evening, Hazel Grace.
A quick question for you.
Did you ever write that eulogy I asked you to prepare?
I may have.
Do you think you could find your way down... to the literal Heart of Jesus in the next few minutes?
Maybe. ls everything okay?
I love you, Hazel Grace.
Can I have the keys?
Oh.
Where you going?
We're gonna eat something.
I have to go. Hazel, you have to be hungry.
You didn't even eat lunch.
I'm just not hungry.
Hazel, you cannot not eat.
I'm aggressively un-hungry.
Hazel, I know Gus is sick, but you got to take care of yourself.
This has nothing to do with Gus.
Well, then you've got to stay healthy.
Come on, just eat something, honey.
"Stay healthy"?
Okay, I'm not healthy, and I'm gonna die.
Do you realize that?
I'm dying, and you're gonna be here... and you're not gonna have anyone to look after, or hover around... and you're not gonna be a mother anymore, and I'm sorry... but there's nothing I can do about that.
So, can I please go?
Why would you say that to me?
Because you said that.
What are you talking about?
In the ICU.
Hazel...
That's not the truth.
I was wrong.
All right?
Even if you died...
"When."
Even when you die...
I'll always be your mother.
It's the greatest thing I'll ever be.
That is my biggest fear, Mom.
When I am gone... you're not gonna have a life anymore.
You're just gonna sit and you're gonna stare at walls... or you're gonna off yourselves or...
Hazel, honey, we're not gonna do that.
Losing you...
That is gonna hurt like hell.
But you of all people know it's possible to live with pain.
You just do it.
I'm taking classes in social work.
Wait, you're what?
Yeah, um...
You know, if I can take what we've been through... and help other people, maybe counsel families...
Mom, how could you not tell me this?
We didn't want you to feel abandoned.
Feel abandoned?
You guys, this is...
This is the best news.
You go.
Okay?
Baby.
Straight ahead, yeah.
To your left, a little bit.
That's a step, right?
Yeah, put your hand out.
There's a podium to your right.
Yeah, perfect.
Beautiful.
Hi.
You're late.
How you doing? You look ravishing, Hazel Grace.
I know, right?
What's going on, guys?
Tell her, Gus.
I wanted to attend my own funeral.
I mean, I'm hopeful that I'll be able to attend as a ghost, but...
However, just in case it doesn't work out...
I decided to plan this pre-funeral.
Ready?
Augustus Waters was a cocky son of a bitch.
But we forgave him.
Not because of his superhuman good looks... or because he only got 19 years when he should've gotten way more.
18 years, buddy.
Dude, come on.
Really? I'm assuming you have a little more time, you interrupting bastard.
Interrupt me in the middle of my eulogy.
But when the scientists from the future... come to my house with robot eyes... and they tell me to try them on...
I'm gonna tell those scientists to piss off, because... because Gus, I don't even want to see a world without you.
I don't.
I don't want to see a world without Augustus Waters.
Then, having made my point, I'll probably put the robot eyes on... because, you know, they're robot eyes.
Sounds awesome.
And I don't know...
Um... This is just so hard.
Um...
Godspeed.
Yeah.
Hazel, can I get a hand here?
To the right, a little bit.
Yeah, and turn around. Sit down.
There you go.
It's down to you, Hazel Grace.
Hello.
My name is Hazel Grace Lancaster... and Augustus Waters was the star-crossed love of my life.
Ours was an epic love story... and I probably won't be able to get more than a sentence out... without disappearing into a puddle of tears.
Like all real love stories... ours will die with us.
As it should.
You know, I'd kind of hoped that he would be the one eulogizing me.
Because there's really no one else...
Yeah, no.
Um...
I'm not gonna talk about our love story, because I can't.
So, instead, I'm gonna talk about math.
I am not a mathematician, but I do know this.
There are infinite numbers between zero and one.
There's point-one, point-one-two, and point-one-one-two, and... and an infinite collection of others.
Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between zero and two... or between zero and a million.
Some infinities are simply bigger than other infinities.
A writer that we used to like taught us that.
You know, I want more numbers... than I'm likely to get.
And, God... do I want more days for Augustus Waters than what he got.
But, Gus... my love...
I cannot tell you how thankful I am... for our little infinity.
Hold on.
You gave me a forever... within the numbered days.
And for that, lam... lam eternally grateful.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
Augustus Waters died eight days later in the ICU.
When the cancer, which was made of him... stopped his heart, which was also made of him.
It was unbearable.
The whole thing.
Every second, worse than the last.
One of the first things they ask you in the ER... is to rate your pain on a scale from one to ten.
I've been asked this question hundreds of times... and I remember once... when I couldn't catch my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire... the nurse asked me to rate the pain.
Though I couldn't speak, I held up nine fingers.
Later, when I started feeling better... the nurse came in and she called me a fighter.
"You know how I know?" she said.
"You called a ten a nine."
But that wasn't the truth.
I didn't call it a nine because I was brave.
The reason I called it a nine was because I was saving my ten.
And this was it.
This was the great and terrible ten.
"I will fear no evil, for You are with me...
"Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
"You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
"You anoint my head with oil. My cup overflows.
"Surely, goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life...
"and I will dwell in the house of the Lord...
"forever."
Augustus Waters fought hard for many years.
His battle was a courageous one, and his strength...
What a load of shit, huh, kid?
...was a source of inspiration for each and every one of us.
Let us pray.
We thank You, Lord, for the life of Augustus Waters...
We need to fake-pray now.
...for his strength and his courage.
Lord, we ask that You be with us today, that You be close... that You comfort his friends and family.
Thank You for Your presence, Lord.
All this we pray in Jesus' name.
Amen.
Amen.
Now, we are going to hear from Gus' special friend...
Hazel Lancaster.
Not that it really matters, but I was his girlfriend.
There's a beautiful quote in Gus' home that reads...
"if you want the rainbow, you have to deal with the rain."
Even in his last few days...
Um...
I didn't believe a word.
He was always able to crack a smile.
But that's okay.
I knew this was the right thing to do.
Funerals, I'd decided, are not for the dead.
They're for the living.
Hey, want some company?
No, I'm okay.
I'm just gonna drive for a bit by myself.
Love you.
Love you.
You spoke beautifully.
I'll see you soon.
Drive safe. Okay-
May I?
Omnis cellula e cellula.
Your boy Waters and I corresponded quite a bit in his last days.
Oh. So, you read your fan mail now?
I wouldn't exactly call him a fan.
He detested me.
But he was quite insistent I attend his funeral... and tell you what became of Anna and her mother... so here I am.
And that's your answer, "Omnis cellula e cellula."
"Life comes from life."
I'm really not in the mood.
You don't want an explanation?
No, I don't.
Thank you, though.
Have a great life.
You remind me of her.
I remind a lot of people of a lot of people.
My daughter was eight.
And she suffered beautifully for so long.
She had leukemia like Anna?
Just like Anna.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
And I'm sorry for yours.
And sorry for ruining your trip.
You didn't ruin our trip.
We had an amazing trip.
Are you familiar with the Trolley Problem?
There's a thought experiment in the field of ethics... known as the Trolley Problem.
Philippa Foot was an English philosopher...
Oh, my God.
Hazel, I'm trying to explain something to you.
I'm trying to give you what you wanted.
No, you're not!
You are a drunk, and you're a failure... and I need you to get out of my car right now... so that I can go home, and be by myself and grieve!
You'll want to read this.
I don't want to read anything.
Can you just get out of my car?
Please get out of my car!
Fine.
Can I come in?
I'm so, so sorry.
Yeah.
It was a privilege, though, wasn't it?
To love him?
Gives you an idea how we feel about you.
Hazel?
There's a friend here to see you.
Do you know if it hurt or whatever?
Apparently he was struggling for breath for a long time... and then eventually he just went unconscious.
It wasn't great or anything.
Dying sucks.
Gus really loved you, you know?
I know.
He wouldn't shut up about it.
Yeah.
It was annoying.
He talked about you so much.
I didn't find it that annoying.
I know. I know you didn't.
Did you get that letter from your author friend?
Ew. He's not my friend.
How do you know about that?
Well, I was talking to him at the cemetery... and he said he came all this way to give that letter to you.
Yeah, well, I'm over it.
I have no interest in reading another word of that asshole's again.
No, he didn't write it.
Gus wrote it.
What?
Apparently Gus wrote something down and then sent it to Van Houten.
Oh, my God.
Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good person, but a shitty writer.
You're a shitty person, but a good writer.
I think we'd make a good team.
I don't want to ask you for any favors... but if you have the time, and from what I saw, you have plenty... please fix this for me.
It's a eulogy for Hazel.
She asked me to write one, and I'm trying.
I just...
I could use a little flair.
See, the thing is, we all want to be remembered.
But Hazel's different.
Hazel knows the truth.
She didn't want a million admirers. She just wanted one.
And she got it.
Maybe she wasn't loved widely, but she was loved deeply.
And isn't that more than most of us get?
When Hazel was sick, I knew I was dying... but I didn't want to say so.
She was in the ICU, and I snuck in for 10 minutes... and I sat with her, before I got caught.
Her eyes were closed.
Her skin, pale.
But her hands were still her hands.
Still warm, and her nails were painted this dark blue-black color... and I just held them.
And I willed myself to imagine a world without us... and what a worthless world that would be.
She's so beautiful.
You don't get tired of looking at her.
You never worry if she's smarter than you... because you know she is.
She's funny without ever being mean.
I love her.
God, I love her.
I'm so lucky to love her, Van Houten.
You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world... but you do have a say in who hurts you.
And I like my choices.
I hope she likes hers.
Okay, Hazel Grace?
Okay-
Life was given to us a billion years ago.
What have we done with it?
Lucy.
It's easy as pie. In and out, all done and dusted.
And why don't you do it yourself?
The last thing the guy's expecting is a total 10 turning up to deliver the case.
It'll blow his mind. Come on!
What's in it?
Sweetheart!
Don't get paranoid on me, all right?
You trust me, don't you?
Fuck!
Richard, I really do like you.
But I have to take care of myself right now.
I don't know. I've got to concentrate on so many things.
Hey, hey.
What are you doing?
I'm going home, because I have exams on Monday.
I have to shower and I have to study, okay?
You know what?
The other day, I was in this museum.
And you know what I found out?
What?
The first ever woman was named Lucy.
Is that supposed to make me feel better?
Yeah.
No.
I'll call you. Okay?
I'll be honest with you.
I can't deliver the case myself.
I had a little falling-out with the guy.
It's nothing major, but if it's you, problem solved.
You walk in there, you go up to the reception, you ask for Mr. Jang to come down.
He comes down, he takes the case, you flash him your prettiest smile and bounce.
Look!
You can even see the reception from here.
Come on.
What's in the case?
I don't know, it's just some paperwork.
Yeah?
Let's see it then.
It's locked.
And only Mr. Jang has the code.
I'm just the delivery boy.
Do you get paid to do this?
Yeah, kind of.
Like how much?
Okay! We are negotiating now or...
No, no. How much do you get paid?
I want to know how much.
A thousand dollars.
You get paid a thousand dollars for delivering paperwork?
I don't know. It takes me 10 minutes and they pay me a grand and the rest is none of my business.
Well, it's none of my business either, I'll tell you now.
Listen!
What?
We split it down the middle. Hmm?
That's 500 for you, and 500 for me.
Richard, I will call you.
Listen, it's the third time this week,
I'm showing up in the same hotel, with the same cowboy hat.
Oh.
Problem solved!
Go, go. I'll wait for you. Go.
Lucy, honey...
I've done this a dozen times.
It's paperwork.
It's probably just some designs they switched so they can copy them.
That's how it works in this country.
Even my Stetson was made here.
Look.
Says so on the label, "Made in Taiwan."
So long, cowboy with the fake Stetson.
Baby, please.
Richard, I got to go. And seriously...
What the hell are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I really need your help.
Stop!
Stop it!
Take this off me right now!
I can't.
Take this off me right now!
I can't, Mr. Jang's the only one who has the key.
All you have to do is go into the hotel and ask for him at the reception.
No!
Take it off me right now!
I'm so sorry. I really have no choice.
The sooner you go in, the sooner you'll be back out!
I can't believe you did this to me.
I'll be right here. You have my word.
Your word isn't worth shit!
It's worth 500 bucks, up front.
You're an asshole.
And you're wonderful.
Miss, may I help you?
Uh, yes.
I'm here for, uh...
Mr. Jang.
Yes, um...
Who should I say is here?
Richard.
Um, Richard sent me.
What is your name?
No, Richard.
Richard's...
He's just looking for a place to park.
Mr. Jang still wants to know your name.
Lucy.
Lucy what?
Just Lucy.
If he could be quick, because I have to...
Just a second while I translate.
Mr. Jang is on his way. Stay right here.
Can I sit?
Mr. Jang said you need to stay right here.
I think it's better if you stay right here.
Excuse me.
Regent Hotel.
No!
No!
Please!
I don't know anything!
I don't know anything! Please! Please!
No! Please!
Do you speak English?
Lucy! Yes, I'm Lucy.
This has just been a terrible mistake.
I'm just supposed to deliver this case.
If you lost the key, you don't have to chop off my hand.
You can just cut the chain, okay?
Please.
I'm begging you, please.
No, no, no!
Please.
Please!
Hello, miss. I speak English. I translate for Mr. Jang.
Please tell him that I haven't done anything. I don't know anything.
It's all just a big mistake, okay?
Please tell him that.
Yes, okay, okay. Hold on.
Mr. Jang wants to know what's in the case.
No, I don't know what's in the case.
Do you speak English or don't you speak English?
Yes, I do.
I studied one year at International High School in New York.
Okay.
Richard gave me the case to give to you, that's all I know.
Okay? Please tell him that.
He gave me a paper with numbers written on it. What is this?
It's the code to open the case.
What's really in here?
Nothing dangerous.
So why won't he open it himself?
He doesn't trust Mr. Richard.
I don't trust Richard, either.
I only dated him for a week.
Mr. Jang insists that you open the case.
Okay, okay.
Please, God, help me.
He wants you to hurry up.
Mr. Jang has other things to do.
Can you describe the contents of the case?
It's four plastic pouches filled with a blue powder. Like a...
Maybe a purple powder.
I don't know. It looks gross.
Mr. Jang wants to offer you a job.
A job?
I don't want a job.
If life starts approximately a billion years ago, we will have to wait 400,000 years to see the aberration of the first nerve cells.
This is where life as we know it begins.
Brains in formation of only a few milligrams.
It's not possible to determine any sign of intelligence yet.
It acts more as a reflex.
One neuron, you're alive.
Two neurons, you're moving, and with movement, interesting things begin to happen.
Animal life on Earth goes back millions of years.
Yet most species only use 3 to 5% of its cerebral capacity.
But it isn't until we reached human beings at the top of the animal chain that we finally see a species use more of its cerebral capacity.
10% may not seem like much, but it's a lot if you look at all we've done with it.
Now let's discuss a special case.
The only living being that uses its brain better than us.
The dolphin.
It is estimated that this incredible animal uses up to 20% of its cerebral capacity.
In particular, this allows it to have an echolocation system that is more efficient than any sonar invented by mankind.
But the dolphin did not invent the sonar, it developed it naturally.
And this is the crucial part of our philosophical reflection we have today.
Can we therefore conclude that humans are concerned more with having than being?
Lucy.
What did you do to my stomach?
Nothing!
Just a little horizontal slit.
It's very well done.
And you'll find within a month, the scar is practically invisible.
So, you'll be able to show your tummy off on the beach next summer.
I don't care about the scar.
Is it why we opened you up, yeah?
Rest assured, we didn't harvest your organs or anything.
We merely slipped a little package into your lower tummy.
It's a new drug that kids in Europe are going to love, believe me.
What is it?
Well, the scientific term is C.P.H.4.
Which is not very sexy from a sales point of view.
So we're still working on something with a bit more pop.
Any Suggestions?
Excuse me.
Welcome!
Welcome, come on in. Lovely!
Oops!
Splendid, splendid!
Marvelous! Lovely, lovely.
- How are you?
- Very good, my dear.
THE LIMEY Okay.
Right.
Um...
First of all, many thanks for taking part in this enterprise, which I'm sure will go off flawlessly.
These lovely passports and tickets will enable you to return home in the next 24 hours.
Now, upon arrival, you will be taken in hand by our people, so that we might recover our merchandise and you might rediscover the freedom which you so richly deserve.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you, but for any of those who may be tempted to warn or turn themselves in to the authorities,
we have the names and addresses of the families of every one of you, down to the most distant cousins, right?
So, we rely, therefore, on your complete discretion.
Good!
Anyway, gentlemen, madam, allow me to be the first to wish you bon voyage!
Oops.
Lovely.
You're gonna sell this?
I'm afraid it's our business model.
For primitive beings like us, life seems to have only one single purpose, gaining time.
And it is going through time that seems to be also the only real purpose of each of the cells in our bodies.
To achieve that aim, the mass of the cells that make up earthworms and human beings has only two solutions.
Be immortal or to reproduce.
If its habitat is not sufficiently favorable or nurturing...
The cell will choose immortality.
In other words, self-sufficiency and self-management.
On the other hand, if the habitat is favorable...
They will choose to reproduce.
That way, when they die, they hand down essential information and knowledge to the next cell, which hands it down to the next cell and so on.
Thus, knowledge and learning are handed down through time.
Okay, okay. Keep calm.
You have to wait. Just play for time.
You'll have time to think it through on the plane.
Just take the flight.
Take the flight, get out of here.
That's the main thing right now. Just save time.
Don't try anything. Keep your cool. You're alive.
You're alive, babe. You're alive.
That's all that matters. Just wait.
Save time.
Save time.
I'm not in the mood.
Let's imagine for a few moments what our life would be like if we could access, let's say,
20% of our brain's capacity.
This first stage would give us access to and control of our own body.
Sir?
Yes.
Has it been proved scientifically?
For the moment, it's just hypothesis, I confess.
But if you think about it, it's troubling to realize that the Greeks, the Egyptians and the Indians had notion of cells centuries before the invention of the microscope.
And what to say about Darwin, whom everybody took for a fool when he put forth his theory of evolution.
It's up to us to push the rules and laws and go from evolution to revolution.
100 billion neurons per human, of which only 15% are activated.
There are more connections in the human body than there are stars in the galaxy.
We possess a gigantic network of information to which we have almost no access.
Sir?
Yes.
And what will be the next stage?
Well, the next stage would probably be control of other people.
But for that, we would need to access at least 40% of our brain's capacity.
After control of ourselves and others would come control of matter.
But now we're entering into the realm of science fiction and we don't know any more than a dog who watches the moon.
Excuse me, sir.
Yes.
But what would happen if, for some reason we ignore, somebody unlocked 100% of their cerebral capacity?
100%?
Yes.
I have no idea.
Hey! You speak English?
No, no, no.
You speak English?
Yes, yes.
Take me to the hospital now.
Hospital.
My leg!
Hospital!
Wait for me.
Miss! Hello?
Hey! Miss!
I need help. It's urgent.
You cannot be in here. We are operating!
Please, get out!
You wouldn't have been able to save him anyway.
The tumor had already invaded the cortex and the right side of his spine.
Somebody put a bag of drugs in me. I need you to remove it. It's leaking.
Do it now.
Right. I'll just administer a local anesthetic.
Don't bother.
Right.
Okay.
Calm down, please.
Put the gun down.
I'm just going to examine, okay?
Do you mind?
No.
Hello?
Mom?
Hey! LUCY-
Baby, it's great to hear from you!
But what time is it over there?
I don't know, it's night.
Hold on a sec, let me get rid of the other line.
I'm going to have to go inside.
I'm back. You're not partying too much, are you?
You promised me you'd look after yourself.
I'm trying to, Mom. Lam trying to.
Well, thanks for calling out of the blue like this.
Your father's gonna be sad he missed you.
He isn't home from the gym yet.
Usually, you call us in the morning.
Yes?
I feel everything.
What do you mean, sweetie?
Space, the air,
the vibrations, the people.
I can feel the gravity.
I can feel the rotation of the Earth, the heat leaving my body,
the blood in my veins.
I can feel my brain, the deepest parts of my memory...
Sweetie, we have a bad connection. I can't hear you so well.
What did you say about memory?
The pain in my mouth when I had braces.
I can remember the feeling of your hand on my forehead when I ran a fever.
I remember stroking the cat, it was so soft.
The cat?
What cat, honey?
A Siamese with blue eyes and a broken tail.
Sweetie, you can't possibly remember that.
You were barely a year old.
I remember the taste of your milk in my mouth.
The room, the liquid...
Sweetie, what are you talking about?
I just wanna tell you that I love you,
Mom and Dad.
Sweetie...
And I wanna thank you for the thousand kisses that I can still feel on my face.
I love you, Mom.
I love you, too, sweetie.
More than anything in the world.
How much is left?
500 grams.
And how long will it take my body to eliminate the rest of it?
To answer that, I need to know what it is.
May I?
Go ahead.
C.P.H.4.
Tell me about it.
Pregnant women manufacture C.P.H.4 in the sixth week of pregnancy in tiny quantities.
For a baby, it packs the power of an atomic bomb.
It's what gives the fetus the necessary energy to form all the bones in its body.
I'd heard they tried to make a synthetic version of it.
I didn't realize that they'd succeeded.
If it really is C.P.H.4, in this quantity,
I'm amazed you're still alive.
Not for long.
Learning's always a painful process.
Like when you're little and your bones are growing and you ache all over.
Can you believe I can remember the sound of my own bones growing?
Like this grinding under the skin.
Everything's different now.
Like, sounds are music that I can understand, like fluids.
It's funny, I used to be so concerned with who I was and what I wanted to be and now that I have access to the furthest reaches of my brain,
I see things clearly and realize that what makes us us it's primitive.
They're all obstacles.
Does that make any sense?
Like this pain you're experiencing.
It's blocking you from understanding.
All you know now is pain. That's all you know, pain.
Where are the others?
The others carrying the drugs.
I need the rest of it, for medicinal purposes.
Berlin.
Paris.
Rome.
Thank you for sharing.
Oh. Evening, Professor.
Bonsoir, Albert.
Do we have you for dinner tonight?
I'm afraid so. I'm exhausted.
Have a good rest.
Thank you.
You scared the shit out of me, ringing that bell like some nutbar!
I missed you.
Me, too.
Yeah, you lose your keys or something?
Yeah.
Can I borrow your laptop?
Yeah, of course.
So I spent all of yesterday in auditions, which are awesome.
They just have you standing around all day because they don't give a shit about your time gabbing away in Chinese.
Who understands Chinese?
I don't understand Chinese.
And then they say they're always gonna call, and they never do, because they don't even take your phone number.
Except this one guy, but he's not Chinese.
He works at the agency and he's cute.
Oh, my God, he's cute.
In the cute-and-l-kinda-know-it kinda way.
Like he had this thing...
Oh, my God, and his ass!
Phew! Let me get started on that!
And you are never gonna guess where he took me.
Four Seasons, Royal Suites, and we made love all night.
I'm sorry, I'm talking about myself. What's up?
How's Richard?
He's dead.
You guys are crazy.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Yes?
Professor Norman, my name's Lucy.
I just read all your research on the human brain.
We need to meet.
All of my research?
Well, I'm very flattered, young lady, but I find that hard to believe.
I must have written no less than.
6,734 pages. I can recite them to you all by heart, if you wish.
Are you one of Emily's friends?
This sounds like one of her silly jokes. Is she there with you?
No, I'm all on my own.
Who are you?
I just told you.
Uh...
Lucy, right?
Yes, sorry.
I read your theory on the use of the brain's capacity.
It's a little rudimentary, but you're on the right track.
Thank you.
Professor, my cells are reproducing at a phenomenal speed.
Several million per second.
I'm having trouble precisely evaluating the time of my death, but I doubt I'll last more than 24 hours.
What are you talking about?
What I'm saying is that your theory is not a theory.
I absorbed a large quantity of synthetic C.P.H.4.
That will allow me to use 100% of my cerebral capacity.
Right now, I'm at 28%, and what you wrote is true.
Once the brain reaches 20%, it opens up and expands the rest.
There are no more obstacles. They fall away like dominoes.
I'm colonizing my own brain.
Well, I don't know what to...
Say.
It's true, I've been working on this theory for over 20 years, but it's only ever been hypotheses and research ideas.
I never thought anyone would...
You can control your own metabolism?
Yes.
And I can start to control other people's bodies.
Also, I can control magnetic and electric waves.
Not all of them, just the most basic.
Television.
Telephone.
Radio.
That's amazing.
I don't feel pain, fear,
desire.
It's like all things that make us human are fading away.
It's like the less human I feel, all this knowledge about everything, quantum physics, applied mathematics,
the infinite capacity of a cell's nucleus.
They're all exploding inside my brain, all this knowledge.
I don't know what to do with it.
If you're asking me what to do...
You know, if you think about
the very nature of life,
I mean, from the very beginning, the development of the first cell
that divided into two cells.
The sole purpose of life has been
to pass on what was learned.
There was no higher purpose.
So if you're asking me what to do with all this knowledge you're accumulating,
I'd say pass it on.
Just like any simple cell going through time.
Time.
Yes, of course.
I'll be at your door in 12 hours.
You're leaving?
Yes.
What is this?
A prescription.
Since when did you start writing in Chinese?
Since an hour ago.
Luce, I don't understand any of this.
Your kidneys aren't functioning efficiently, your liver's failing you.
You need to make some lifestyle changes.
Take this medication, work out, eat organic.
You'll be okay.
Last night, at 11 pm, a woman shot a patient dead.
It happened at Tri-Service Hospital.
The suspect is 25, blonde, medium height.
Police are hunting nationwide.
She is armed and dangerous.
Del Rio.
I've got a weird call from a US citizen in Taiwan.
A young woman calling to tip us off about a big drugs ring.
- I'll take it.
- I'll tape you.
Hello?
I have important information about a group of drug traffickers.
I need to speak with someone in a position of authority.
Aha.
You're very lucky, there's no one with more authority in this office than me.
But let's start at the beginning. What is your name?
Listen up, Pierre Del Rio.
Get off your desk, sit in your chair, pick up the red pen to the left of you and take down everything I say.
There are no cameras. Hurry up!
I've no time to waste.
Go ahead.
I'm gonna be sending you the details of three people about to arrive in Europe.
Each one is carrying a kilo of drugs.
I need you to arrest them and collect the substance.
I'll need it for later.
What form are these drugs in?
Bars? Capsules?
Powder. Hidden in plastic pouches inside their intestines.
Excuse me?
Make sure to be careful when you remove them.
The product is very powerful.
Believe me.
Got it?
Yeah.
Good.
I'm counting on you.
Okay?
Good morning.
That's him!
Pick him up.
Come with me, please.
Hello.
Sir, come with us.
Welcome to Rome.
Good morning, sir.
Please, follow me.
This way.
Yeah, sure.
Del Rio.
Thanks for calling me back.
We took delivery of your package.
I'll send you the paperwork for the transfer.
Bye.
Okay, we got all three.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now beginning our descent to Paris Charles de Gaulle.
Miss, I have to ask you to put away your computers now.
You should wipe your nose.
Excuse me?
May I have a glass of champagne?
Um, yes. Of course.
Could you bring some champagne to the girl over there?
Yeah, I just have a nosebleed.
Miss, your champagne.
Thank you.
I'm very sorry, but you really need to close your table now.
Sure.
To knowledge.
If the habitat is not sufficiently favorable or nurturing...
The cell will choose immortality.
In other words, self-sufficiency and self-management.
No!
Miss, miss!
You must remain seated!
Miss!
Miss! Open the door!
You really have to go back to your seat!
We're gonna land soon. Please! Open the door.
Please, say something. Are you okay? Miss?
Miss, please, open the door!
Please do something, help me! Please!
We're gonna land soon!
Open the door!
Miss!
Are you okay?
Say something!
With a scar on her lower abdomen?
Pretty recent, with thread in it.
- How is she? - Fine.
She's sleeping.
With the shot I gave her, she'll be out all day.
- She's awake!
- Are you sure?
She's sitting on the bed.
That's her.
- You didn't restrain her?
- Sure, we did!
Miss!
Don't move.
I need to talk to you alone.
And I need you to put your hands up, please.
Did you get the packets?
Yes.
Where are they?
They're safe.
Here, in Paris.
They'll be safer in my hands.
Don't leave the car there. Park it up.
You know, as a cop you see some pretty weird shit.
But I have to be honest with you.
What you did back there, that freaked me out.
To put everyone to sleep like that.
Do I need to be worried?
No.
Good.
Do you mind?
No.
What's that?
Korean. I'm gonna drive.
Hey!
No, no, no.
This is a police car!
You can't.
No, this is not possible, lady.
This is a police car.
Okay, okay.
Let's go, guys!
Sir, sir, excuse me, sir.
I need to talk to somebody.
Talk to the police.
Look, I'm a German citizen and I demand to see a lawyer.
I'll check with Surgery.
- Grab us some food.
- You're a foodaholic.
Do you always drive like that?
I've never driven before.
Great.
Hey, that's one-way.
We're late.
Hey, I'd rather be late than dead.
We never really die.
Sorry, sir.
I don't feel good.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm gonna tell them to stop following us.
Don't bother.
I got you bacon...
Give me the case.
Kill her and get the pouch.
Don't stand there, kill her!
Ahhh!
Open it.
Let's go.
I'm not sure I could be of any help for you.
Yes, you are.
What for?
A reminder.
Shall we go?
Where are we going?
Take the first left.
Okay.
Move!
Follow that car.
Professor?
Hello?
Lucy.
Oh! It's her! It's her!
Hey, you.
You're in Paris?
Yes, lam.
Good, good! Excellent.
So, look, I am no longer at the hotel now.
I have come to the university, where I've taken the liberty of calling together a few of my colleagues to discuss your case.
Top minds in their field and very trustworthy.
I trust you.
Oh, thank you.
So, do you think you could meet us here at the university?
I'm, uh...
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Likewise.
Captain Del Rio.
How do you do?
Um...
Let me introduce you to my colleagues.
This is Professor Cartier, neurosurgeon.
I know who everyone is.
Of course.
Gentlemen, this is Lucy, the first woman to...
I mean...
As I mentioned earlier, Miss Lucy has, for reasons that remain a mystery to me, unlocked certain portions of her brain that offer access to previously unexplored cerebral zones.
She has abilities.
Can you give us an example?
Your daughter, Gabrielle, age six, died in a car accident.
It was a blue car, leather seats, plastic bird hanging from the rear view mirror.
Boss, 5 men down at the hospital. Sorry.
How many men left?
I have about 25 with me.
That damn girl, she doesn't give in.
She's a witch.
I know that.
I'll kill her myself.
There are men coming here. Can you secure the room?
I need to stay focused.
Sure.
Speed it up.
How did you manage to access all this information?
Electrical impulses.
Every cell knows and talks to every other cell.
They exchange a thousand bits of information between them per second.
Cells group together, forming a giant web of communication, which in turn forms matter.
Cells get together, take on one form, deform, reform.
Makes no difference, it's all the same.
Humans consider themselves unique, so they've rooted their whole theory of existence on their uniqueness.
"One" is their unit of measure.
But it's not.
All social systems we've put into place are a mere sketch.
One plus one equals two. That's all we've learned.
But one plus one has never equaled two.
There are, in fact, no numbers and no letters.
We've codified our existence to bring it down to human size to make it comprehensible.
We've created a scale so that we can forget its unfathomable scale.
But if humans are not the unit of measure and the world isn't governed by mathematical laws,
what governs all that?
Film a car speeding down a road.
Speed up the image infinitely and the car disappears.
So what proof do we have of its existence?
Time gives legitimacy to its existence.
Time is the only true unit of measure.
It gives proof to the existence of matter.
Without time, we don't exist.
Time is unity.
Search the whole building and find her!
We won't be able to hold them for much longer.
Time to go then.
Are you sure you need such huge doses?
I'm afraid you won't survive.
Some cells inside me will fight and defend their integrity till the very end.
In order to attain the last few percent, I have to force it to crack the cells open to their nucleus.
But all of this knowledge, Lucy...
I'm not even sure that mankind is ready for it.
We're so driven by power and profit.
Given man's nature, it might bring us only instability and chaos.
Ignorance brings chaos, not knowledge.
I'll build a computer and download all my knowledge in it.
I'll find a way for you to have access to it.
Yeah.
I just hope we will be worthy of your sacrifice.
Nobody move!
Do you understand English?
What is she doing?
She's looking for energy and matter.
And she's trying to connect with our computers.
Chong-Ju!
I'm here, boss.
Do something about them.
Okay, boss!
You guys, come on.
Ready?
You Okay?
Get a medic. Fast!
Oh, my God. What's happening?
What is she making?
New generation computer, I presume.
Where is she?
Where is she?
Answer me.
Answer me!
Hey, you!
Look. The computer, it's moving.
DEL mo; Hey.
Where is she?
Life was given to us a billion years ago.
Now you know what to do with it.
- I'm done. - It's clear. Come out.
Sir, I--I appreciate you offer me this job now ah.
- So, whats the extraction point?
- Las Vegas.
Ahh, Shit! That's far.
- Ahh - Let's go.
Do you mind?
So who is the target?
Job a friend of mine left unfinished.
Where you on the firstnum package?
No, never been there.
The Pittsburg deal.
Look, why don't you just drive?
I--I am sorry man, are you gonna-- Have been a longsome from this for a while.
Ever heard the Hamazaki story?
Yes.
Tell you what!
Hamazaki didn't have a such a fucking monster for a kid.
Young, old, male, female anyone, could have been the victim.
No matter what he did, how many perople he killed...
Hamazaki who glamours was able to wipe out all the traces.
Money. Money is the best right clean shit, don't you think?
Think about it though.
Happen to be as it his the only son, a monster, violent, crazy ass sex vanishes.
Maybe Hamazaki is a vicim too.
Mr. Hamazaki died in Yokohama, the people hasn't wasted any time.
They gave the son a massive inheritence and cut him out of Yokohama immediately completely.
One condition for him to inherit the money was he couldn't able to repay him.
So in other words, they greasefully kicked his ass out of the country.
And then finally they are in Los Angeles.
L.A.'s melting pop was a huge appeal for this crazy son of a bitch and his violence.
- Do you know who is after Hamazaki's son?
- I heard it was Doctor from Japan.
Right, he had a grudge against Hamazaki's son.
It was unfortunate that his wife became one of his... toys.
Let me go!
Let me go!
No! It hurts!
Help! Somebody!
Let me go...
Help...
- Keiko!
- Honey...
Stop!
You must live.
Live and tell the world what I am.
I am a Legend!
Isn't that true?
Natural, I heard that the Doctor tried to commit suicide.
Look its no use arguing how the docor became crippled.
What ever! Tell me something I don't know already.
Why did Hamazaki's son killed doctors's wife?
I heard there was a reason.
Mr. Hamazaki was this doctor's patient.
Hamazaki's son thought the dotor killed his father.
Completely unreasonable.
Man, at stage 5 cancer no one could saved him.
So even if this guy is a total fucking monster right... he is still the son and he loves his father in his own way.
So, what was plan for the revenge?
Hamazaki's Son, he had body guards 24/7 right?
His house is like... its like a fucking fortress.
On top of that, the bastard is crippled.
He was a mastermind.
His plan was perfect.
She is a meth addict...
Going through withdraw...
She is barely fuckable
You can't train her to do anything exciting.
You mean number 4.
What the hell?
Why did he pick a junkie?
You think its me?
its not like I was there.
- He probably saw something in her.
- May be.
Eat this.
Eat.
Eat.
As the season started to change, the woman broke from her addiction.
Eat this.
You talk about an epic revenge starting up with a rehab.
Oh... this mastermind.
He is either part of cult or just stupid.
Her name is Mayumi.
Typical story of a young women's downfall.
She grew up with normal parents.
Normal childhood, she could have had a normal life.
The guy she dated is a bit of a bad boy.
She learned to drink at 17.
She fucked guys she liked when she got drunk.
She fucked guys she didn't liked when she got drunk.
Next guy was even worse.
She started sniffing popers.
The guy after that she started smoking marijuana.
Now you know what comes next.
Last guy was the worse.
He turned her into a meth head.
She started selling herself to make money for meth.
She couldn't get enough and eventually...
She became a property.
That was the guy's plan from the first.
When life had no more worth, she was sold overseas.
Told she would fetch a good price, because she was a Japanese.
Whatever. Enough about the chick.
What about the mastermind's plan?
What's he-- What's he planning on doing with her?
I had enough with the story, let's get something to eat.
The mastermind planned to turn Mayumi into the perfect killer.
What is this a Japanese mongo?
Or a Luc Besson film?
You don't just train some chick to be perfect assassin.
You just... pay chuck a money to some mercs and you know-- that's how you fucking do it
Of course!
But if it has to be Mayumi.
Or some attracted women to get even close to the target.
Remeber mastermind's target is Hamazaki's son.
The man lives in a fortress It's impossible to break in.
He is got professional body guards around him at all times.
All right, I am with you, I am with you.
I see it, so--
Where did he find the compremise?
- Have you heard of Necrophilia?
- Ah! Fuck! I am not into that shit.
Necrophilia is been around for ages.
Dates back to Romans, Egyptians, the Chinese.
Ancient times.
It's not such a peculiar fetish.
It's defenitely a peculiar fetish.
Whatever. Proceed with your talk oh tell.
The secret place was created with an enormous fund from warped minded nobles from around the world.
Which is called the place "The Room"
It's a club for a Necrophilic.
Deadbody Lovers.
Hamazaki's crazy son was a member.
He love to rape them live, but he loved to fuck the dead one's even more.
The caretaker of this place had quite the operation.
He created this secret Necrophilia room inside a nuclear waste disposal facility.
This facility is in radiation control zone, so civilians are off limits.
Police where on the payroll, so if anything would have happen they could coverup anything and everything.
In other words, "The Room" does not exist.
It is in somewhere a parallel world-- thats the very reason mastermind shows this place the very reason to get Hamazaki's son.
One of the few places on earth that the bastard's fortune couldn't help him. Client's bodyguards are not allowed in. No exception.
Once the client gets dropped off, the bodyguards retreat 5 km away from the buiding.
And they return 4 hours later to pick up the clients.
Also, no member of this club is allowed to bring in any kind of weapon.
All of them get thourough body check up, everytime they go in.
Every corner, every hole in their body is searched.
But they are not allowed inside.
Please take your time to enjoy every bit of this fine lady.
Oh oh oh oh-- stop.
I don't want to hear all that shit.
All right.
Cannabalism cost extra.
In any case the mastermind shows this location to assassinate Hamazaki's son, some place... free of all the high level security and the boduguards.
All right, all right. I get it.
So, the idea here is to put Mayumi into her apparent death, sneak her body in to the room-- and... hit the target.
But wait wait what about the weapons?
All right, well... let me finish the whole story.
Still got a way to Vegas.
Let you tell you about the masterminds training propgram.
What did he put her through to make her into the perfect killer.
I didn't buy you and save your life just for fun.
I saved your life so you can become my tool.
For me, you are not a human being.
You are my tool.
I have no interest in your past, nor your future.
I'm training you to make the best assassin.
You fail my training, you die.
You die, I buy another woman.
Simple as that.
I see you wanted to die... but it's not your decision to end your life.
Now I own you. You die when I tell you to die.
Got it!
Use your whole body. Again.
With you body.
Again.
Focus... and go.
I don't care how you do it.
Hit his face.
Hit him!
Look at the gun.
Shoot her.
If your bullet can hit her...
I will set you free.
Next, I will teach you how to use a handgun.
First thing you need to learn is...
a bullet will miss you in most cases.
Only the highly-trained ones can hit their targets.
So don't fear the gun pointed at you.
That's the basics in gunfights.
Make a precise decision even at gunpoint.
That's how you survive a gunfight.
Understand?
Keep that in mind.
You were just shot 3 times from 5 meters away, and none of the bullets hit you.
You will be using this handgun.
It's called an automatic pistol;
it uses the pressure of the gas when fired, pushes the slide back, pushes out the empty shell, brings the next ammunition into the chamber.
It has two kinds of safety locks.
S is safety position. Trigger is locked.
When it's down, it decocks, but you're still able to fire with double action.
This gun is made in Germany, but is used by military and police around the world.
It's acclaimed for its accuracy and endurance to fire over 20,000 times.
Its superb quality, small size and lightweight make this gun perfect for our mission.
The number of ammunition you can load is 13.
Another feature of an automatic pistol is it can easily be taken apart into several pieces.
Take the magazine out, pull the slide back, take it to the unlocked position.
Take out the holding pin, then take out the slide.
Disassemble in 10 seconds, reassemble in 10 seconds.
Hold up the gun.
Bend your arms. Support your hands.
Don't touch the trigger.
Learn to line up the sight and the target.
Keep your feet apart.
Cut the meat in three areas and stick the parts in.
Take out the parts, assemble the UPS, load the magazine, and shoot at the target.
Empty the gun. All in 20 seconds.
Now start.
19 seconds.
Now there's only a few things left to teach you.
The guy you're going to kill... is this guy.
Your reward is that you get to live.
If the assassination succeeds, I will give you new nationality.
To live free in this country.
If you fail, it means death.
I shall explain the plan.
This is a nuclear waste disposal facility.
Inside, there's a place called "The Room"
where lunatics come to rape and eat the dead bodies.
Your target is one of those lunatics.
When the target's visit is set,
I will get informed from a certain contact.
When that happens, I will put you in a state of apparent death, and deliver you to this place as a dead body.
When you wake up, kill everyone in the room.
Man, woman, young or old.
No matter what you do, do not fail to take down this target.
If you fail to kill him,
I will kill you.
I know only a few things about this place.
But one thing for certain is he is the caretaker of this place and he is definitely inside.
I don't know how many work for him, how many are armed, or what they're armed with.
I have no data on that.
This place seems unbreakable.
But I've found one blind spot.
The body check on the dead body that's delivered here is outsourced to the body provider.
That means, if you could bribe the body provider, you can hide a weapon inside the body, and deliver her into this place as an assassin.
I've succeeded in bribing the body provider.
I'll hide the gun inside your body through surgery.
It's the only way to get a weapon inside "The Room".
When you wake, you open the sewn stitches, take out the gun parts, assemble it and pursue your mission.
You're only able to bring one magazine.
So you will only have 13 bullets.
The wounds on your body that I'll cut to hide the gun won't be fatal.
Only if the bleeding stops and you get a blood transfusion within 22 minutes.
Based on your weight, height and volume, it takes 22 minutes for you to die from blood loss.
Get out of "The Room" before this time limit runs out.
I assure your safety once you're out.
A helper that I've hired will be waiting for you.
He's my best friend and can be trusted.
He will have this emergency blood transfusion kit in the car.
A man dies when one third of his blood is lost.
But a woman can survive even if she loses two-thirds of her blood.
God created women superior to men.
So?
Will you do this?
If you survive, you are free.
I will hide the slide above your left breast.
The body of the gun inside your right torso.
She has about the same volume as you.
Watch for the next 22 minutes as she dies from blood loss.
By knowing what will happen to you, you can avoid much of the danger.
You start losing a lot of blood, the brain tells the body to shut down.
Stay strong here, or you'll pass out.
Fight the shock!
If you pass out, this mission fails here.
10 minutes have passed.
You've lost about half the blood in your body.
Physical capacity declines, and the brain lacks blood.
You feel like you're drunk or in a bad dream.
You won't be able to tell delusion from reality.
Be aware!
Bring yourself back to reality.
15 minutes have passed.
At this point, your eyesight starts to go.
Your vision comes and goes, like a light turning on and off.
Use your other senses that are capable.
22 minutes have passed.
I'm not doing this revenge for justice!
I'm doing this for myself!
I'll take revenge and go to hell.
That's how this ends.
If I have to, I would waste her life, or yours, or mine!
Understandl?
If you want to, shoot me.
I won't be able to finish my revenge, but maybe it's not so bad to join Keiko now.
This is my wife.
The only woman I've truly loved with all my heart.
Keiko!
Honey...
I've been informed the target will come to "The Room" tomorrow.
We'll use local anesthesia for this.
With general anesthesia, it takes time to recover, and you won't be ready to fight right after you wake up.
You may feel slight pain and discomfort during the surgery.
You're fine. The internal organs aren't damaged.
The surgery was a success.
You have a gun and a magazine with 13 ammo hidden in your body.
I will now put you in a state of apparent death.
When you wake up, that is it.
Kill everyone, everyone in "The Room", no matter what happens!
Now, farewell.
If all goes well, you will never see me again.
Sir, our guest of the day has arrived.
Supervise the body check please.
I will be right there.
Number 3, come in.
Number 3, come in.
We may have been compromised.
This way, please.
Please take this just in case.
It's me.
We have an intruder.
We cannot assure the guest's safety on our own.
Get here, ASAP.
I repeat, get here, ASAP.
En Route.
Fight the shock!
If you pass out, this mission fails here.
Number 3 is done. I repeat, number 3 is down.
The body wasn't there.
Acknowledged. Take her down. Now!
1. 2. 3. 4.
5. 6. 7.
8.
You feel like you're drunk or in a bad dream.
You won't be able to tell delusion from reality.
Be aware!
Bring yourself back to reality.
15 minutes have passed.
At this point, your eyesight starts to go.
Use your other senses that are capable.
9. 10. 11. 12.
13.
That magazine holds 13 ammo of 9 mm, eh?
You...
You're out of bullets, aren't you?
14.
That's why I took this job. To find the helper.
- Where is she?
- Who hired you?
- Now--now, where is she?
- Who hired you?
I thought the Hamazaki can glamour up wouldn't care, if the son was dead or not.
Oh, you didn't know?
Hamazaki's son... had son.
Had a kid, he always loves his father, no matter what hopeless fucking piece of shit he is.
He hired me to take his revenge.
Isn't funny?
Funny isn't?
Hamazaki's son's son. The grandson.
That's my fucking client.
Now fucking tell me where she is and you get to fucking live.
Where is she?
OK. Let's find some place more quiet to talk.
Hands up.
Gun woman-- where is she?
Sorry-- she was my extraction point.
The mastermind was my son's doctor.
Even though I was told that he had a... only 5% chance for survival, he cured him.
Saw him today, he didn't even know that he had been sick at all.
Whatever--
The last hit? Who was it?
The job a friend of mine left unfinished.
Need a job?
Well, my dad was a farmer.
Um, like everybody else back then.
Of course, he didn't start that way.
Computer says you're too tight.
- Nah, I got this.
- Crossing the Straights.
- Shutting it down, Cooper.
- No!
- Shutting it all down. - No, I need power up!
Dad?
Sorry, Murph.
Go back to bed.
- I thought you were the ghost.
- No.
There are no such things as ghosts, babe.
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.
Maybe that's because Grandpa's close to being one himself.
Back to bed.
Were you dreaming about the crash?
Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh.
The wheat had died.
The blight came and we had to burn it.
And we still had corn.
We had acres of corn.
But, uh, mostly we had dust.
I guess I can't describe it. It was just constant.
Just that steady blow... of dirt.
We wore, um, little strips of sheet... sometimes over our nose and mouth... so that we wouldn't breathe so much of it.
When we set the table, we always set the plate... upside-down.
Glasses or cups, whatever it was... upside-down.
Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!
Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn, Herbicide Resistance 101.
- Check?
- Yes, sir.
Not at the table, Murph.
Dad, can you fix this?
What the heck did you do...
- to my lander? - Wasn't me.
Let me guess.
It was your ghost?
It knocked it off.
It keeps knocking books off.
No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.
- Hey.
- I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.
Dad, tell her.
Well, it's not very scientific, Murph.
You said science was about admitting what we don't know.
- She's got you there.
- Hey.
Start looking after our stuff.
Coop.
All right, Murph, you want to talk science?
Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.
No, you got to go further.
You got to record the facts, analyze, get to the how and the why... then present your conclusions.
Deal?
- Deal.
- All right.
- Have a good day at school.
- Hold up.
Parent-teacher conferences. Parent. Not grandparent.
Slow down, turbo!
- That's not a dust storm.
- Nelson's torching his whole crop.
Blight?
They're saying it's the last harvest for okra.
Ever.
He should've planted corn like the rest of us.
Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley.
She's single.
What's that supposed to mean?
Repopulating the earth.
Start pulling your weight, young man.
Why don't you start minding your own business, old man?
All right, Murph, give me second.
Uh-huh.
Third.
- Find a gear, dumb-ass.
- Grind it!
Shut it, Tom!
- What'd you do, Murph?
- Ah, she didn't do nothing.
- Blew a tire is all.
- Murphy's Law.
Shut up!
- Grab the spare, Tom. - That is the spare.
Get the patch kit!
How am I supposed to patch it out here?
You got to figure it out.
I'm not always gonna be here to help you.
What's going on, Murph?
Why did you and Mom name me after something that's bad?
We didn't.
Murphy's Law?
Murphy's Law doesn't mean that something bad will happen.
What it means is whatever can happen will happen.
And that sounded just fine with us.
Whoa!
Get in.
Get in, let's go.
What about the flat tire?
Yeah.
It's an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.
Take the wheel, Tom.
Go, go, go!
Keep that aimed right at it.
Faster, Tom.
I'm losing it.
Right at it.
Stay on it.
Here we go.
Nice one, Tom.
Dad?
I almost got it.
Don't stop. Don't stop!
Dad!
Tom!
You told me to keep driving.
Well, I guess that answers the old "if I asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.
- We lost it.
- No, we didn't.
Want to give it a whirl?
This way.
Go.
Let's lay her down right there at the edge of the reservoir.
Nicely done.
How long you think it's been up there?
Delhi Mission Control went down, same as ours...
- ten years ago.
- Heh.
So for ten years?
- Why did it come down so low?
- I don't know.
Maybe the sun cooked its brain or it was looking for something.
- What?
- Give me a large flatblade.
Maybe some kind of signal?
I don't know.
What are you gonna do with it?
I'm gonna give it something socially responsible to do... like drive a combine.
Can't we just let it go?
It wasn't hurting anybody.
This thing needs to learn how to adapt, Murph... like the rest of us.
How's this work?
You guys come with?
I've got class.
This one needs to wait.
- What did you do?
- They'll tell you about it in there.
- Am I gonna be mad?
- Not with me.
- Just please try not to.
- Hey. Relax.
I got this.
Little late, Coop.
Yeah, we had a flat.
And I guess you had to stop off at the Asian fighter plane store.
No, actually, sir, that's a surveillance drone.
With outstanding solar cells.
It's Indian.
Take a seat.
So, uh... we got Tom's scores back.
He's going to make an excellent farmer.
Yeah, he's got a knack for it.
What about college?
The university only takes a handful.
They don't have the resources to...
I still pay my taxes.
Where's that money go?
There's no more armies.
Well, it doesn't go to the university.
Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.
You're ruling my son out for college now?
- The kid's 15.
- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
What's your waistline?
About what, 32?
- About a 33 inseam?
- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.
It takes two numbers to measure your ass but only one to measure my son's future?
Come on.
You're a well-educated man, Coop.
- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.
Okay, well, right now we don't need more engineers.
We didn't run out of television screens and planes. We ran out of food.
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.
- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.
We're a caretaker generation, Coop.
And things are getting better.
- Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...
- Are we done here, sir?
No.
Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.
Murph is a great kid.
She's really bright.
But she's been having a little trouble lately.
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
She always loved the pictures.
It's an old federal textbook.
We've replaced them with the corrected versions.
Corrected?
Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
You don't believe we went to the moon?
It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.
The Soviets bankrupted themselves pouring resources... into rockets and other useless machines.
"Useless machines."
If we don't want a repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the 20th century, then... we need to teach our kids about this planet, not tales of leaving it.
One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI.
If we had any of those left, the doctors would've been able to find... the cyst in my wife's brain before she died instead of afterwards.
Then she'd have been the one listening to this instead of me... which would have been a good thing, because she was always... the calmer one.
I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.
But Murph got into a fistfight with several of her classmates over this... Apollo nonsense.
So we thought it best to bring you in and see what ideas... you might have for dealing with her behavior on the home front.
Yeah, you know what? Um, there's a game tomorrow night.
She's going through a bit of a baseball phase.
Her favorite team is playing.
There's gonna be candy and soda and...
I think I'll take her to that.
How'd it go?
I got you suspended.
- What?
- Cooper.
This is Cooper. Go.
Coop, those combines you rebuilt went haywire.
Just reset the controllers.
I did that.
Now you should come take a look.
One by one they've been peeling off the fields and heading over.
Something's interfering with the compass.
Magnetism or some such.
Nothing special about which book.
I've been working on it, like you said.
- I counted the spaces.
- Why?
In case the ghost is trying to communicate.
I'm trying Morse.
Morse?
Yeah.
- Dots and dashes, used...
- I know what Morse code is, Murph.
I just don't think your bookshelf's trying to talk to you.
Had to reset every compass clock and GPS to offset for the anomaly.
- Which is?
- I don't know.
If the house was built on magnetic ore... we'd have seen this the first time we switched on the tractor.
I hear your meeting at the school didn't go so well.
Heh. You heard?
It's like we've forgotten who we are, Donald.
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.
When I was a kid... it felt like they made something new every day.
Some... gadget or idea.
Like every day was Christmas.
But six billion people... just try to imagine that.
And every last one of them trying to have it all.
This world isn't so bad.
And Tom will do just fine.
You're the one who doesn't belong.
Born 40 years too late, or 40 years too early.
My daughter knew it, God bless her.
And your kids know it.
Especially Murph.
Well, we used to look up in the sky and wonder... at our place in the stars.
Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.
Cooper, you were good at something... and you never got a chance to do anything with it.
I'm sorry.
You didn't expect... this dirt that was giving you this food... to turn on you like that and destroy you.
In April...
I believe I'm right... Fifteenth of April, I think.
This happened about 1:30 when that thing... came off the top of that canyon.
In my day, we had real ballplayers.
Who are these bums?
In my day, people were too busy... fighting over food to even play baseball.
Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.
School says you're gonna follow in my footsteps.
I think that's great.
- You think that's great?
- You hate farming, Dad. Grandpa said.
Grandpa said, huh?
Listen, all that matters is how you feel about it.
I like what you do.
I like our farm.
You're gonna be great at it.
Let's get out of here.
All right, it's a doozy.
All right, gang, let's mask up.
- Tom?
Murph?
Check?
- Yeah.
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?
Murph?
The ghost.
Grab your pillow.
You're sleeping in with Tom.
It's not a ghost.
It's gravity.
I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town.
You want to clean that up when you've finished praying to it?
It's not Morse, Murph.
It's binary.
Thick is one, thin is zero.
Coordinates.
Nope.
Mm-mm.
Here we go.
Thirty-three.
That's it.
I can't miss this!
Grandpa will be back in a couple hours, Murph.
But you don't know what you're gonna find.
And that... is why I can't take you.
Murph?
Grandpa will be home in a while.
Tell him I'll call him on the radio.
- Aah!
- Jesus.
- What are you doing?
- Heh-heh.
Oh, you think this is funny? Huh?
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.
Make yourself useful.
Hey, Murph?
Murph!
I think this is the end of the road.
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?
That's my girl.
Step away!
Don't shoot!
I'm not armed.
My daughter's in the car.
- Don't be afraid. - Aah!
How did you find this place?
Where's my daughter?
You had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map.
Where did you get them?
Where's my daughter?
Don't make me take you down again.
Sit down!
Oh, you still think you're a Marine, pal?
Marines don't exist anymore.
- And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.
- Where did you find those coordinates?
But you don't look much like a lawnmower.
Think I'll turn you into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.
No, you won't.
TARS, back down, please.
You know, you're taking a risk using ex-military security.
They're old, and their control units are unpredictable.
It's what the government could spare.
Who are you?
Dr. Brand.
I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.
What makes you think I'm not?
Wasn't near as cute, either.
Please, Dr. Brand.
I don't have any idea what this is.
Now I'm scared for my daughter and want her by my side.
You give me that, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Get the principals and the girl in the conference room, please.
Your daughter is fine.
Bright kid. Must have a very smart mother.
It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors.
So why don't you just let us back up from your fence and we'll be on our way? Huh?
- It's not that simple.
- Well, sure, it is.
I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.
Yes, you do.
Dad!
Hello, Cooper.
Professor Brand.
Explain to me how you found this facility.
Kind of an accident.
We sort of stumbled upon it. We were on a salvage run...
You're sitting in the best-kept secret in the world.
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.
Cooper, please.
Cooperate with these people.
Look.
It's kind of hard to explain.
We learned these coordinates from an anomaly.
What sort of anomaly?
I hesitate to term it supernatural, but it definitely wasn't scientific.
You're going to have to be specific, Mr. Cooper. Right now.
It was gravity.
Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?
Now, I'm real happy that you're excited about gravity, bud... but you're not getting any answers from us until I get assurances.
- Assurances?
- Yeah.
Like, that we're getting out of here. And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.
Don't you know who we are, Coop?
No, professor, I don't.
You know my father, Professor Brand.
We're NASA.
- NASA?
- NASA.
The same NASA you flew for.
I heard they shut you down, sir... for refusing to drop bombs from the stratosphere... onto starving people.
When they realized that killing other people was... not a long-term solution, then they needed us back.
- In secret.
- Why secret?
Because public opinion wouldn't allow spending on space exploration.
Not while you're struggling to put food on the table.
Blight.
Wheat seven years ago.
Okra this year.
Now there's just corn.
And we're growing more than we ever have.
But like the potatoes in Ireland and the wheat in the Dust Bowl... the corn will die.
Soon.
We'll find a way, professor.
We always have.
Driven by the unshakable faith the Earth is ours.
Not just ours, no.
But it is our home.
Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.
We don't even breathe nitrogen. Blight does.
And as it thrives, our air gets less and less oxygen.
The last people to starve will be the first to suffocate.
And your daughter's generation... will be the last to survive on Earth.
Murph is tired.
I was wondering if she could take a nap in my office.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Okay... now you need to tell me what your plan is to save the world.
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.
Rangers.
The last components of our one versatile ship in orbit, the Endurance.
Our final expedition.
You sent people out there looking for a new home?
The Lazarus missions.
- Oh, that sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.
Sure, but he had to die in the first place.
There's not a planet in our solar system that could sustain life... and the nearest star's over a thousand years away.
That doesn't even qualify as futile.
Where'd you send them?
Cooper...
I can't tell you anymore unless you agree... to pilot this craft.
- You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.
This team never left the simulator.
We need a pilot, and this is the mission that you were trained for.
Without even knowing it?
An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive.
You were going anyway.
We had no choice.
But something sent you here.
- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?
How long would I be gone?
Hard to know.
Years?
I've got kids, professor.
Get out there and save them.
Who's "they"?
We started detecting gravitational anomalies almost 50 years ago.
Mostly small distortions to our instruments in the upper atmosphere.
In fact, I believe you encountered one yourself.
Yeah, over the Straights.
My crash.
Something tripped my fly-by-wire.
Exactly.
But of all these anomalies, the most significant is this:
Out near Saturn... a disturbance of space-time.
- Is that a wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.
And it leads where?
Another galaxy.
A wormhole's not a naturally occurring phenomenon.
Someone placed it there.
- "They"?
- Mm.
And whoever they are, they appear to be looking out for us.
That wormhole lets us travel to other stars.
It came along right as we needed it.
They've put potentially habitable worlds right within our reach.
Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.
- You sent probes into that?
- Mm-hm.
We sent people into it.
Ten years ago.
The Lazarus missions.
Twelve possible worlds... twelve Ranger launches carrying... the bravest humans ever to live... led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.
Each person's landing pod had enough life support for two years.
But they could use hibernation to stretch that... making observations on organics over a decade or more.
Their mission was to assess their world, and if it showed potential... then they could send out a signal, bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.
And what if the world didn't show promise?
Hence the bravery.
You don't have the resources to visit all 12.
No.
Data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary.
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us some clue as to which worlds have potential.
And one system shows promise.
One.
That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?
One system with three potential worlds?
No long shot.
Okay.
So if we find a home...
- then what?
- That's the long shot.
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.
Did you notice anything strange about the launch chamber?
This entire facility's a centrifuge.
Some kind of vehicle.
A space station?
Both. Plan A.
How do you get it off the ground?
The first gravitational anomalies changed everything.
Suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity was real.
So I started working on a theory and we started building this station.
But you haven't solved it yet.
That's why there's Plan B.
The problem is gravity.
How to get a viable amount of human life off the planet.
This is one way.
Plan B: a population bomb.
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs weighing in at just under 900 kilos.
How would you raise them?
With equipment on board, we incubate the first 10.
After that, with surrogacy, the growth becomes exponential.
Within 30 years, we could have a colony of hundreds.
The real difficulty with colonization is genetic diversity.
This takes care of that.
But what about the people here?
You just... give up on them?
My kids?
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.
You're asking me to hang everything... on an almost.
I'm asking you to trust me.
Find us a new home.
And by the time you return...
I will have solved the problem of gravity.
I give you my word.
Go away!
Murph.
Go!
If you're leaving, just go.
This world was never enough for you, was it, Coop?
What, because heading out there is what I feel like I was born to do?
And it excites me? Heh.
No, that does not make it wrong.
It might.
Don't trust the right thing done for the wrong reason.
The why of the thing, that's the foundation.
And the foundation's solid.
We farmers, we sit here every year when the rains fail and we say:
"Next year."
Well, next year ain't gonna save us, nor the one after that.
This world's a treasure, Donald, but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.
Mankind was born on Earth, it was never meant to die here.
Tom will be all right, but you got to make things right with Murph.
I will.
Without making promises you don't know you can keep.
You have to talk to me, Murph.
I need to fix this before I go.
Then I'll keep it broken so you have to stay.
After you kids came along, your mom said something to me I never quite understood.
She said, "Now... we're just here to be memories for our kids."
And I think that now I understand what she meant.
Once you're a parent, you're the ghost of your children's future.
You said ghosts didn't exist.
That's right, Murph.
Murph, look at me.
I can't be your ghost right now.
I need to exist.
They chose me.
Murph, they chose me.
You saw. You're the one who led me to them.
That's exactly why you can't go.
I figured out the message.
- One word.
Know what it is?
- Murph.
"Stay."
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.
You don't believe me.
Look at the books!
Look at this.
It says, "Stay."
Why...?
You're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"
No, I'm coming back.
When?
One for you, one for me.
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or... traveling near the speed of light, or... near a black hole... time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.
When we get back... we're gonna compare.
- Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.
By the time I get back, we might even be the same age, you and me.
"What?" Imagine that!
Aw, Murph...
You have no idea when you're coming back.
No idea at all!
Murph, don't...
Don't make me leave like this.
Come on, Murph!
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!
Hey...
I love you.
Forever.
You hear me?
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.
I'm coming back.
- How'd it go?
- Fine.
Just fine.
I love you, Tom.
- Travel safe, huh?
- Yeah.
You look after our place for me, all right?
- All right?
- Uh-huh.
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?
I'll make sure they bring it back.
Look after my kids, Donald!
Go for main engine start.
T-minus 10...
- Dad!
- Nine...
Dad!
Eight... seven...
Dad!
Six... five, main engine start, four... three... two... one.
Booster ignition and...
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.
Prepare for stage one separation.
Stage one.
There is Mach 1.
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?
They gave him a humor setting so he'd fit in better with his unit.
He thinks it relaxes us.
A giant sarcastic robot.
What a great idea!
I have a cue light I can use when I'm joking if you like.
That'd probably help.
You can use it to find your way back to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.
- What's your humor setting, TARS? - That's 100 percent.
Let's bring it on down to 75, please.
Stage two separation.
All feeds going manual.
Going manual.
Deactivate probe heater one, two and three.
Check.
- Taking control.
- This is handover to you.
- A.D.F. check.
- Over.
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.
One hundred percent.
Ex-mites.
It's hard leaving everything.
My kids.
Your father.
We're going to be spending a lot of time together.
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.
Just being honest.
I don't think you need to be that honest.
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?
- Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?
Absolute honesty isn't always the most diplomatic, nor the... safest form of communication with emotional beings.
Okay.
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.
We are coming up on the Endurance.
Twelve minutes out.
Okay. Taking control.
Approaching module port, 500 meters.
It's all you, Doyle.
Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.
I feel good.
Take us home.
- Lock.
- Target locked.
- Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.
Good job.
Door's not charging.
Never mind.
Cooper, you should have control.
Control here.
Communication with ring module active.
Oh, wow.
That's initiate.
- Are we ready to spin?
- Just a sec.
- Hello, CASE.
- Hello, TARS.
All right, we're all set.
All right, let's do it.
Heh.
Thirty percent of spin.
One G.
How's gravity treating you back there?
Well.
Romilly?
Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.
- You all right?
Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.
OK, I think we have some Dramamine in the hab pod, I'm just gonna get that or maybe in the cryo-beds.
I'll just be a sec. - Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?
- Bring a lot.
- Heh-heh-heh.
Amelia, be safe.
- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will, Dad.
It looks good for your trajectory.
We've calculated two years to Saturn.
That's a lot of Dramamine.
Look after my family, will you, please, sir?
We'll be waiting for you when you get back.
A little older, a little wiser, but happy to see you.
Do not go gentle into that good night
Old age should burn and rave at close of day
Rage, rage against the dying of the light
Though wise men at their end Know dark is right
Because their words had forked No lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night
Rage, rage against the dying of the light
- You good?
- Yeah.
Okay, thank you.
Here.
Pills.
So alone.
We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.
No, I mean them.
Hm?
It's a perfect planet, and we won't find another one like her.
No, it's not like looking for a new condo.
The human race is going to be... adrift... desperate for a rock it can cling to while it catches its breath.
We need to find that rock.
And our three prospects are at the edge of what... might sustain human life.
Laura Miller's planet is first.
- Laura started our biology program.
Mm-hm.
- Uh, Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.
Oh, uh, Wolf's a particle physicist.
None of them had families, huh?
No.
No attachments. My father insisted.
They all knew the odds against ever seeing another human being again.
I'm hoping we can surprise at least three of them.
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?
He's remarkable.
He's the best of us.
He inspired 11 people to follow him on the loneliest journey in human history.
Scientists, explorers.
That's what I love.
You know, out there we face great odds.
Death, but... not evil.
You don't think nature can be evil?
No.
Formidable.
Frightening.
But...
- no, not evil.
- Hm.
Is a lion evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds?
Just what we take with us, then.
Yeah.
This crew represents the best of humanity.
Even me, huh?
You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.
There you go.
- Don't stay up.
- I'll be there in a minute.
Just remember, Coop, you are literally wasting your breath.
Hey, TARS?
Let's go over that trajectory one more time.
Eight months to Mars.
Counter-orbital slingshot around. Fourteen months to Saturn.
Nothing's changed on that.
Just let me ask you something.
- Dr. Brand and Edmunds...
- Why are you whispering?
They can't hear you.
Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?
I wouldn't know.
Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know" or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?
- I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.
- Aah.
But not a poker face, Slick.
Hey, guys.
Uh, Dad's about to go down for the long nap.
So I wanted to give you an update.
Uh... The Earth looks amazing from here. Um...
You can't see any of the dust.
Heh.
Um, I really hope you guys are doing great.
I know you'll get this message.
Professor Brand's assured me he'll get it to you.
Know that I love you.
- Is it him?
- I don't think so, Murph.
You must be Donald.
Hello, Murph.
Why are you in my dad's truck?
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.
He sent you a message.
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.
If you record any messages, I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.
Murph is a bright spark.
Maybe I should fan the flame.
She's already making fools of her teachers.
So maybe she should come and make a fool out of you.
- So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.
The next time you hear from Cooper, they'll be coming up on Saturn.
As far as school goes... the administration wants me to repeat Plant Pathology.
But they said I could start Advanced Agriculture a year early.
All right, I got to go, Dad.
Hope you're safe up there.
Um, sorry, Coop.
I asked Murph to say hi, but she's as stubborn as her old man.
I'll try again next time.
You all right, Rom?
This gets to me, Cooper.
This.
This.
Millimeters of aluminum, that's it, and then nothing... out there for millions of miles won't kill us in seconds.
You know that some of the finest... solo yachtsmen in the world don't know how to swim?
They don't know how.
And if they go overboard, psst, they're done.
We're explorers, Rom.
This is our boat.
Here.
This is from the, uh, relay probe?
It was in orbit around the wormhole.
This is the wormhole, and every time we'd come around... we would receive images from the other side of the foreign galaxy.
Oh, yeah. Like swinging a periscope around.
Exactly.
So we got a pretty good idea what we're gonna find on the other side, huh?
Navigationally.
Guys? We'll be approaching the wormhole in about three hours.
Hey, Coop?
Can we stop the spinning?
Why?
Because we're close enough to see it now?
All right.
Thanks.
There, that's it!
That's the wormhole!
Say it, don't spray it, Rom.
It's a sphere.
Of course it is.
What, you...? You thought it would just be a hole?
No, it's just that all the illustrations I've ever seen, they...
In the illustrations, they're trying to show you how it works.
So they say you want to go from here to there.
- But it's too far, right?
- Mm-hm.
So a wormhole bends space like this, so you can take a shortcut through... a higher dimension.
Okay, so... to show that, they've turned three-dimensional space into two dimensions... which turns a wormhole into two dimensions, a circle.
What's a circle in three dimensions?
- A sphere.
- Exactly.
A spherical hole.
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?
I'm not thanking anybody until we get out of here in one piece, Rom.
Any trick to this, Doyle?
No one knows.
The others made it, right?
At least some of them.
Everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system?
To our galaxy.
Here we go.
The controls won't work here.
We're passing through the bulk.
It's space beyond our three dimensions.
All you can do is record and observe.
What is that?
I think it's them.
Distorting space-time.
Don't!
Don't!
What was that?
The first handshake.
We're...
We're here.
So the lost communications came through.
- How?
- The relay on this side cached them.
So years of basic data.
No real surprises.
Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up, as has Dr. Mann's.
Edmunds' went down three years ago.
Transmitter failure?
Maybe.
He was sending the thumbs up right until it went dark.
But Miller's still looks good though, right?
- Because she's coming up fast.
Mm-hm.
With one complication.
The planet is much closer to Gargantua than we thought.
- Gargantua?
- It's what we're calling the black hole.
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it.
- And Miller's is on the horizon?
- As a basketball around a hoop.
Landing there takes us dangerously close.
And a black hole that big has a huge gravitational pull.
Look, I could swing around that neutron star to decelerate.
No, it's not that.
It's time.
The gravity on that planet will slow our clock compared to Earth's drastically.
How bad?
Every hour we spend on that planet will be... seven years back on Earth.
Jesus.
Well, that's relativity, folks.
Well, we can't just drop down there without...
Cooper, we have a mission.
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission, and our mission Plan A is... to find a planet that can habitate the people that are living on Earth now.
You can't just think about your family. Now you have to think bigger.
I am thinking about my family and millions of other families, okay?
Plan A does not work if the people on Earth are dead by the time we pull it off.
No. It doesn't.
That's why there's a Plan B.
Okay. Cooper's right.
We need to think of time as a resource, like oxygen and food.
Going down will cost us.
All right, look.
Dr. Mann's data is promising, but it will take months to get there.
And Edmunds', it's even further.
Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has is very promising. it's water, it's organics...
- You don't find that every day.
- No, you don't.
And just think about the resources, including time... that would be spent trying to get back here.
- Romilly...
- Yeah?
How far off from Miller's planet do we have to be to stay out of the time shift?
Just back from the cusp.
All right, which is here, just outside of Miller's planet.
- Right.
- Okay.
Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet.
Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit around Miller's planet... which would conserve fuel, but we would lose a lot of time... what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet... outside of this time shift, to here?
Then we take the Ranger down, we get Miller, we get her samples.
We come back, we analyze, we debrief.
We're in, we're out.
We lose a little fuel, but we save a whole lot of time.
- That'll work.
- That's good.
There's no time for monkey business or chit-chat down there.
So, TARS, you should definitely stay here.
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.
If we're talking about a couple years, I could use the time to research gravity.
Observations from the wormhole, that's gold to Professor Brand.
TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.
Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting, but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.
- You got it?
- I wouldn't leave you behind...
Dr. Brand.
- You ready, CASE?
- Yup.
- You don't say much, do you?
- TARS talks plenty for both of us.
Detach.
- Romilly, are you reading these forces?
It's unbelievable.
A literal heart of darkness.
If we could just see the collapsed star inside... the singularity, yeah, we'd solve gravity.
- And we can't get anything from it?
- Nothing escapes that horizon.
Not even light.
- The answer's there, just no way to see it. - There's Miller's planet.
Goodbye, Ranger.
This is fast for atmospheric entry.
- Should we use the thrusters to slow?
- No.
I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics to save some fuel.
Air brake?
- We want to get down fast, don't we?
- We want to get there in one piece.
- Hang on.
- Brand, Doyle, get ready.
- We should ease!
- Hands where I can see them.
The only time I went down was when a machine was easing at the wrong time.
- A little caution...
- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.
- Cooper, it's too damn fast!
- I got this.
- Should I disable the feedback?
- No. I need to feel the air.
Here we go.
It's just water!
The stuff of life.
Twelve hundred meters.
- Do we have a fix on the beacon?
- Got it!
- Can you maneuver?
- I'll need to shave some speed.
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.
Everybody hang on!
Seven hundred.
On my cue, CASE.
On my cue.
Five hundred meters.
Fire!
Very graceful.
No.
But very efficient.
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!
Go, go, go!
Seven years per hour here.
Let's make it count!
This way.
About 200 meters.
The gravity's punishing.
Been floating through space too long?
One hundred and thirty percent Earth gravity.
Come on. Come on.
- There's nothing here.
- Should be right here.
If the signal's coming from here, then...
Her beacon.
Wreckage.
Where's the rest?
Towards the mountains!
Those aren't mountains.
They're waves.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
That one's moving away from us.
We need the recorder.
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!
We're not leaving without her data.
Get back here now!
We do not have time!
The second wave is coming!
We're in the middle of a swell.
No, I got it.
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!
Brand, get back here now!
No, Cooper, go.
Cooper, go. I can't make it.
- Go!
- CASE, go get her.
- Go!
- Get up. Get up, Brand!
Go, go!
Go!
- I'm not gonna make it!
- Yes, you are.
Yes, you are!
Come on, CASE has her!
Get back here, Doyle!
Come on!
Get to the hatch!
Go, go!
Go!
Shit.
Manually overriding inside hatch!
Cooper!
Wait!
The engines are flooded!
I'm gonna have to shut her down.
Holy shit.
Hang on!
CASE, what's the problem?
Too waterlogged.
Let it drain.
Goddamn it!
- I told you to leave me!
Why didn't you?
- And I told you to get your ass back here!
- One of us was thinking about the mission!
- You were thinking about getting home.
I was trying to do the right thing!
Can you tell that to Doyle?
- CASE, how much time?
- Forty-five to an hour.
The stuff of life, huh?
What's this gonna cost us, Brand?
A lot. Decades.
What happened to Miller?
Judging by the wreckage, she was... broken up by a wave soon after impact.
How's the wreckage stayed together after all these years, huh?
Because of the time slippage.
On this planet's time, she just landed hours ago.
She probably just died minutes ago.
The data Doyle received was just the initial status echoing endlessly.
Oh, we are not prepared for this.
You eggheads have the survival skills of a Boy Scout troop.
Well, we got this far on our brains.
Farther than any human in history.
Well, not far enough!
And now we're stuck here till there won't be anyone left on Earth to save.
I'm counting every minute, same as you, Cooper.
Is there any possibility... some kind of a way we can maybe all jump in a black hole?
Gain back the years?
Don't shake your head at me.
Time is relative, okay?
It can stretch and it can squeeze, but... it can't run backwards. it just can't.
The only thing that can move across dimensions, like time, is gravity.
Okay.
The beings that led us here, they communicate...
- through gravity, right?
- Yes.
Could they be talking to us from the future?
- Maybe.
- Okay. If they can...
"They" are beings of five dimensions.
To them, time might be another physical dimension.
To them... the past might be a canyon that they can climb into and the future... a mountain they can climb up.
Look, Cooper, I screwed up.
I'm sorry.
But you knew about relativity.
Oh.
Brand...
My daughter was 10 years old.
I couldn't teach her Einstein's theories before I left.
Couldn't you have told her you were going to save the world?
No.
When you become a parent, one thing becomes really clear.
And that is that you want to make sure your children feel safe.
And it rules out telling a 10-year-old that the world is ending.
Cooper?
- How long for the engines, CASE?
- A minute or two.
We don't have it.
Helmets on!
Brand, co-pilot, you're up.
CASE, blow the cabin oxygen through the main thrusters!
- We're gonna spark it.
- Roger that.
- Locked.
- Depressurizing.
Engines up!
Hello, Rom.
I've waited years.
How...?
How many years?
- By now it must be...
Twenty-three years... four months, eight days.
Doyle?
I thought I was prepared.
I knew the theory.
Reality's different.
And Miller?
There's nothing here for us.
Why didn't you sleep?
Oh, I had a couple of stretches.
But I stopped believing you were coming back.
And something seemed wrong about dreaming my life away.
I learned what I could from the black hole... but I couldn't send anything to your father.
We've been receiving, but nothing gets out.
- Is he alive?
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
We've got years of messages stored.
Cooper.
Messages span 23 years.
Play it from the beginning.
Hey, Dad.
Checking in. Saying hi.
Um...
Finished second in school.
Miss Kurling's still giving me C's though.
Pulled me down, but second's not bad.
Grandpa attended the ceremony.
Um...
Oh. I met another girl, Dad.
I, uh...
I really think this is the one.
Name's Lois.
That's her right there.
Murphy stole Grandpa's car.
She crashed it. She's okay, though.
Hey, Dad.
Look at this!
You're a grandpa.
His name's Jesse.
I kind of wanted to call him Coop, but Lois says, uh, maybe next time.
Donald says he's already earned the "great" part, so we just leave it at that.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."
Bye-bye, Grandpa.
Okay.
Sorry it's been a while.
Just... what with Jesse and all.
Grandpa died last week.
We buried him out in the back forty next to Mom and...
Jesse.
Which is where we would have buried you if you'd ever... come back.
Murph was there at the funeral.
We don't see her that much, but she came for that.
You aren't listening to this, I know that.
All these messages are just, like... drifting out there in the darkness.
Lois says that, uh...
I have to let you go.
And, uh... so...
I guess I'm letting you go.
I don't know where you are, Dad... but I hope that you're at peace.
Goodbye.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Murph.
You son of a bitch.
I never made one of these when you were still responding... because I was so mad at you for leaving.
And then when you went quiet, it... seemed like I should live with that decision. And I have.
But today's my birthday.
And it's a special one, because you told me...
You once told me that when you came back, we might be the same age.
And today I'm the age you were when you left.
So it would be a real good time for you to come back.
I didn't mean to intrude.
It's just that I've never seen you in here before.
I've never been in here before.
I talk to Amelia all the time.
It helps.
- I'm glad you've started.
- I haven't. I...
I just had something I needed to get out.
- I know they're still out there.
- I know.
There are so many reasons their communications might not be getting through.
I know, professor.
I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.
Them never coming back or... coming back to find we've failed.
Then let's succeed.
So... back to the fourth iteration. Let's run it through some new fields.
With respect, professor, we've tried that hundreds of times.
It only has to work once, Murph.
Every rivet that they strike could have been a bullet.
We've done well for the world here... whether or not we crack the equation before I kick the bucket.
- Don't be morbid, professor.
- I'm not afraid of death.
I'm an old physicist.
I'm afraid of time.
Time.
You're afraid of time.
We've been trying to solve the equation... without changing the underlying assumption about time.
- And that means... each iteration is an attempt to prove its own proof.
It's recursive. It's nonsensical.
Are you calling my life's work... nonsense, Murph?
No, I'm saying that you've been trying to... finish it with one arm...
No, with both arms... tied behind your back.
And I don't understand why.
I'm an old man, Murph.
Can we take this point up at another time?
I want to talk to my daughter.
Stepping out into the universe... we must confront the reality of interstellar travel.
We must reach far beyond our own lifespans.
We must think not as individuals but as a species.
Do not go gentle into that good night
TARS kept the Endurance right where we needed her.
But the trip took years longer than we anticipated.
We no longer have the fuel to visit both prospects, so... we have to choose.
But how?
They're both promising.
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann is the one still transmitting, so...
We've no reason to suspect Edmunds's data would have soured.
His world has key elements to sustain human life.
- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.
And...
I really believe Edmunds' is the better prospect.
- Why?
- Gargantua, that's why.
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes... but no life. Sterile.
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
Because of the black hole?
Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen will happen.
Accident is the first building block of evolution.
But when you're orbiting a black hole not enough can happen.
It sucks in asteroids and comets, other events which would otherwise reach you.
We need to go further afield.
You once said that Dr. Mann... was the best of us.
He's remarkable.
We're only here because of him.
And yet... Yet here he is.
He's on the ground, and he's sending a very unambiguous message, telling us... to come to his planet.
Granted, but Edmunds' data is more promising.
We should vote.
Well, if we vote, there's something you should know.
Brand?
He has a right to know.
That has nothing to do with it.
- What does?
- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.
- Is that true?
- Yes.
And that makes me want to follow my heart.
But maybe we've spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory.
You're a scientist, Brand.
So listen to me... when I say that love isn't something we invented.
It has to mean something.
Love has meaning, yes.
Social utility, social bonding, child rearing...
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?
None.
Maybe it means something more, something we can't... yet understand.
Maybe it's some evidence, some... artifact of a higher dimension that we can't consciously perceive.
I'm drawn across the universe to someone I haven't seen in a decade... who I know is probably dead.
Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving... that transcends dimensions of time and space.
Maybe we should trust that, even if we can't understand it yet.
All right, Cooper... yes... the tiniest possibility of seeing Wolf again excites me.
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.
Honestly, Amelia... it might.
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.
We'll lose about a third again.
But next year... Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm and we'll make it up.
What happened to Nelson?
Murph, would you like some more soufflé?
Oh, no. I'm full, thanks.
It was delicious.
Coop, finish your fritter, please.
Will you spend the night?
Your room is exactly as you left it. it's ready.
I need to get back.
My sewing machine is in there, but there's plenty...
I need to...
Too many memories.
We might have something for that.
Hey, Coop.
The dust.
Lois, I have a friend who... could look at his lungs.
- Amelia, I'm sorry.
- You were just being objective.
Unless you're punishing me for screwing up on Miller's planet.
No, this wasn't a personal decision.
If you're wrong, you will have a very personal decision to make.
Your fuel calculations are based on a return journey.
Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have to decide whether to return home... or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.
Starting a colony could save us from extinction.
You might have to decide between seeing your children again... and the future of the human race.
I trust you'll be as objective then.
He's been asking for you since he came to.
We were trying to reach you.
Murph.
I'm here, professor.
I let you all down.
No, you got us so far.
Real close.
I'll finish what you started.
Good, good Murph.
You had faith... all those... all those years.
I...
I asked you to have faith.
I wanted you to believe... that your father... would come back.
I do, professor.
Forgive me, Murph.
There's nothing to forgive.
I...
I lied, Murph.
I lied to you.
There was no need for him to...
To come back.
There is no way to help us.
But Plan A...
All this. All these people.
And the equation.
Did my father know?
Did he leave me?
Do... not... go... gentle...
No.
No!
You can't leave.
You...
No.
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that your father died today.
He had no pain.
He was at peace.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Brand, did you know?
He told you, right?
You knew.
This was all a sham.
You left us here.
To suffocate.
To starve.
Frozen cloud.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Pray you never learn... just how good it can be to see another face.
I hadn't a lot of hope to begin with, but... after so long, I had none.
My supplies were completely exhausted.
The last time I went to sleep, I didn't even set a waking date.
You have literally raised me from the dead.
- Lazarus.
- Hm.
- What about the others?
- I'm afraid you're it, sir.
So far, surely.
No, our present situation is that there's very little chance of rescuing any others.
Dr. Mann.
Dr. Mann?
Tell us about your world.
Our world, we hope.
Our world, uh, is cold... stark... but undeniably beautiful.
The days are 67 hours long, cold.
The nights are... 67 far colder hours.
The gravity is a very, very pleasant 80 percent of the Earth's.
Now, up here where I landed, the water is alkali... and the air has too much ammonia to breathe for more than just a few minutes... but down at the surface, and there is a surface... the chlorine dissipates.
The ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons and breathable air.
To organics.
Possibly even to life.
We might be sharing this world.
These readings are from the surface?
Over the years, I've dropped various probes.
- How far have you explored?
- I've mounted several major expeditions.
But with oxygen in limited supply, KIPP there really did most of the legwork.
- What went wrong with him, sir?
- Degeneration.
He misidentified the first organics we found as ammonia crystals.
We struggled on for a time, but ultimately I decommissioned him and... used his power source to keep the mission going.
I thought I was alone before I shut him down.
Would you like me to look at him?
No. No. He needs a human touch.
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message for you from the comm station.
Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that your father died today.
He had no pain.
He was at peace.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Is that Murph?
She's... She's grown.
Brand, did you know?
He told you, right?
You knew.
This was all a sham.
You left us here.
To suffocate.
To starve.
Did my father know too?
Dad?
I just want to know... if you left me here to die.
I just have to know.
Cooper, my...
My father dedicated... his whole life to Plan A. I have no idea what she's talking about.
I do.
He never even hoped to get the people off the Earth?
No.
But he's been trying to solve the gravity equation for 40 years.
Amelia, your father solved his equation before I even left.
Then why wouldn't he use it?
The equation couldn't reconcile relativity with quantum mechanics.
You need more. More?
More what?
More data.
You need to see into a black hole.
The laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity.
Romilly, is that true?
If a black hole is an oyster, then the singularity's the pearl inside.
The gravity's so strong, it's always hidden in darkness... behind the horizon.
That's why we call it a black hole.
Okay, but if we see beyond the horizon...
We can't, Coop.
There are some things that aren't meant to be known.
Your father had to find another way to save the human race from extinction.
Plan B. A colony.
Why not tell people?
- Why keep building those stations?
- He knew how hard it would be... to get people to work together to save the species instead of themselves.
Bullshit.
You never would've come unless you believed you would save them.
Evolution has yet to transcend that simple barrier.
We can care deeply, selflessly about... those we know, but that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight.
But the lie.
That monstrous lie?
Unforgivable.
And he knew that.
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity in order to save the species.
- He made an incredible sacrifice.
- No.
An incredible sacrifice is being made by the people on Earth who are gonna die!
Because in his fucking arrogance... he declared their case hopeless.
I'm sorry, Cooper... their case is hopeless.
No. No.
We are the future.
Cooper, what can I do?
Let me go home.
You're absolutely positive?
His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.
- It's worthless?
- It's half the answer.
Okay, how do you find the other half?
Out there?
A black hole.
- But stuck down here on Earth?
- Yeah?
I'm not sure you can.
God, they just pack up and leave.
What are they hoping to find?
Survival.
Damn it.
Murph, don't...? Don't people have a right to know?
Panic won't help.
We just have to keep working, same as ever.
But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand was manipulating us to do?
Brand gave up on us.
I'm still trying to solve this.
So... do you have an idea?
A feeling.
I told you about my ghost.
My dad thought I called it a ghost... because I was scared of it.
But I was never scared of it.
I called it a ghost because it felt... It felt like a person.
It was trying to tell me something.
If there's an answer here on Earth, it's back there... somehow, in that room.
So I have to find it.
We're running out of time.
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?
No, they can stay.
I'll be sleeping anyway.
- Hey, Coop?
- Yeah?
I have a suggestion for your return journey.
- Yeah, what's that?
- Have one last crack at the black hole.
I'm going home, Rom.
Yeah, I know. This isn't going to cost you any time.
There's a chance for the people on Earth.
- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.
- It's what we call a gentle singularity.
- Gentle?
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that... something crossing the horizon fast might survive.
A probe, say.
- What happens after it crosses?
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.
So, what's to say there isn't some way that the probe... can glimpse the singularity and relay the quantum data?
If he's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse.
Just when did this probe become a "he," professor?
TARS is the obvious candidate.
I've already told him what to look for.
I'd need the old optical transmitter off KIPP, Cooper.
You'd do this for us?
Before you get all teary, remember that as a robot I have to do anything you say.
Your cue light's broken.
I'm not joking.
I'll need TARS to remove and adapt some components from KIPP.
I don't want to disturb his archival functions.
I'll supervise.
All right.
Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure sites.
One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.
Once those modules have landed, you don't want to move them.
I can take you to the probe sites, but I don't think... these conditions will hold.
I think we should wait.
CASE is headed down with the rest of the distillery equipment.
I'd really like to secure those sites by nightfall.
Well, these squalls do usually blow over.
Okay, then.
- You'll need a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.
- Are you charged?
- Yeah.
Follow me.
TARS, 72 hours, yeah?
Roger that, Cooper.
Brand told me why you feel you have to go back.
But I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention... that a mission such as ours could certainly use an extra engineer.
You better slow down, turbo.
Safety first, CASE, remember.
Safety first, Cooper.
I have to tell you, Dr. Mann, I'm honored to be a part of this.
But once we set up base camp and secure those modules, my work's done here.
I'm going home.
You have attachments.
But even without a family...
I can promise you that that yearning to be with other people is powerful.
That emotion is at the foundation... of what makes us human.
- How long have you had that cough?
Mom lets me play in here.
I don't touch your stuff.
Just take this gently.
You know why we couldn't just send machines on these missions, don't you?
A machine doesn't improvise well because you can't program a fear of death.
Our survival instinct is our single greatest... source of inspiration.
Take you, for example.
A father... with a survival instinct that extends to your kids.
What does research tell us is the last thing you're going to see before you die?
Your children. Their faces.
At the moment of death, your mind's gonna push... a little bit harder to survive.
For them.
Deep breath.
Uh, hey. I bet you're Coop.
Why don't you have a seat here for me?
It's bad.
They cannot stay here.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
TARS, what's taking so long?
Professor, I am having trouble completing the boot up.
I don't understand.
It's funny.
When I left Earth... I thought I was prepared to die.
The truth is... I never really considered the possibility that my planet wasn't the one.
Nothing worked out the way it was supposed to.
Let's go.
All right, buddy, give me a big deep breath.
What is this?
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry!
I can't let you leave with that ship.
We're gonna need it to complete the mission... once the others realize what this place isn't.
We cannot survive here.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
- They can't stay here anymore.
- You have to leave right now.
Let me make something abundantly clear.
You have a responsibility...
- Oh! Jesus! - Coop, get her stuff.
Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb, Tom!
Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did.
And he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.
You faked all the data?
Yeah.
There's no surface?
No.
I tried to do my duty, Cooper... but I knew the day that I arrived here that this place had nothing.
And I resisted the temptation for years... but I knew that... if I just pressed that button, then... somebody would come and save me.
You fucking coward.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Listen, if you're not going to go, let your family go.
Just save your family.
And we go live underground with you?
Pray that Daddy comes to save us?
Dad's not coming back. He never was coming back.
It's up to me.
You're gonna save everybody?
- Because Dad couldn't do it.
- Dad didn't even try!
Dad just abandoned us!
He left us here to die.
Nobody's going with you.
You gonna wait for your next kid to die?
Get out.
And don't come back.
You can keep my stuff.
Stop it!
No. No!
Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance you're gonna kill yourself!
Those are the best odds I've had in years.
Don't judge me, Cooper.
You were never tested like I was.
Few men have been.
You tried your best, Murph.
You're feeling it, aren't you?
The survival instinct.
That's what drove me. it's what drives all of us.
And it's what's gonna save us.
Because I want to save all of us.
For you, Cooper.
I'm sorry, I can't watch you go through this. I'm sorry.
I thought I could, but I can't.
I'm here. I'm here for you.
Just listen to my voice, Cooper.
I'm right here.
You're not alone.
Do you see your children?
It's okay. They're right there with you.
Did Professor Brand tell you that poem before you left?
Do you remember?
Do not go gentle into that good night
Old age should burn and rave At close of day
Rage, rage against the dying of the light
Brand!
Help!
- Help!
- Cooper?
CASE!
No air.
Ammonia.
Cooper.
Cooper, we're coming! CASE!
- I have a fix. - Go!
Go, go, go!
And away!
Cooper, we're coming.
Hang in there.
Don't talk.
Try to breathe as little as possible.
We're almost there.
There's a security lockout, sir.
It requires a person to access function.
It's all yours, sir.
Try not to breathe.
We're coming. We're coming right now.
CASE, come on! Come on!
We got to go faster, CASE!
Faster, faster, faster!
Hang in there. Come on.
I see him, I see him!
CASE, bank! Bank right!
Cooper!
Cooper!
I'm here!
This data makes no sense.
I'm sorry.
- What?
- Mann was lying!
Go. Go.
Romilly.
Romilly!
Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?
Step back, professor! Step back!
- Romilly...
- Romilly, do you read me?
Keep watch!
Lois?
- What happened to caution, CASE?
- Safety first, Cooper. Romilly?
Romilly, do you read me?
This is Brand.
Romilly?
Dr. Brand.
Cooper.
There's been an explosion.
Dr. Mann's compound.
TARS, TARS, 10 o'clock!
Let me know when TARS is aboard.
Romilly did not survive.
I could not save him.
- TARS is in.
- I'll take her now.
- Do we have a fix on the Ranger?
- He's pushing into orbit!
If he takes control of that ship, we're dead.
- He'd maroon us?
- He is marooning us.
I'll meet you guys downstairs.
Go wait by the car.
Come on! Give me your bag.
Get in the backseat. Get in the backseat now!
Dr. Mann, please respond.
Dr. Mann, please respond!
He doesn't know the Endurance docking procedure.
- The autopilot does.
- Not since TARS disabled it.
Nice.
- What's your trust setting, TARS?
- Lower than yours apparently.
Do not attempt docking.
I repeat, do not attempt docking.
Please res...
Auto-docking sequence withheld.
- Override.
- Unauthorized.
Override.
Unauthorized.
Do not attempt docking.
I repeat, do not attempt docking.
Please resp...
Moving slowly toward the Endurance.
Imperfect contact.
- Override.
- Hatch lockout.
- Is he locked on yet?
- Imperfectly.
Dr. Mann, do not...
Hatch lockout disengaged.
Dr. Mann, do not, I repeat, do not open the hatch.
I repeat, do not open the hatch.
If you open the hatch, the airlock will depressurize.
- What happens if he blows the airlock?
- Nothing good.
Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters, everything we've got, CASE!
- Thrusters are full!
- Back!
Relay my transmission to the on board computer... and have it rebroadcast as emergency P.A.
Dr. Mann...
I repeat, do not open the inner hatch.
Brand?
I don't know what he said to you... but I am taking command of the Endurance.
And then we can talk about completing the mission.
Dr. Mann, listen to me.
This is not about my life.
Or Cooper's life.
This is about all mankind.
There is a moment...
It is not sa...
Oh, my God.
- Cooper there's no point using fuel to chase...
- Analyze the Endurance's spin.
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Docking.
Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.
Okay, get ready to match our spin with the retro thrusters.
- It's not possible.
- No...
It's necessary.
Endurance is hitting stratosphere!
She's got no heat shield.
- CASE, you ready?
- Ready.
Cooper! This is no time for caution.
CASE, if I black out, you take the stick.
TARS, get ready to engage the docking mechanism.
Endurance is starting to heat.
Twenty feet out.
I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.
Ten feet out.
Cooper, we are lined up.
Initiating spin!
Come on, TARS.
Come on, TARS!
- We are locked, Cooper.
- Locked. Easing up!
Easy.
Easy.
Retro thrusters!
Main engines on.
Pushing out of orbit.
Come on, baby.
Killing main engines!
Okay, we're out of orbit.
Okay.
And for our next trick!
It'll have to be good.
We're heading into Gargantua's pull.
Oh, shit.
- CASE, take the stick.
- Roger that.
Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.
Shall I use main engines?
No.
We got to let her slide as far as we can.
- Give it to me.
- There's good news, there's bad news.
Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.
Give it to me straight.
The backup generator kicked in, so the system's stable. They're all good.
Good.
Okay. The navigational hub has been completely destroyed.
We don't have enough life support to make it back to Earth... but we can scratch our way to Edmunds' planet.
What about fuel?
Not enough. But I have a plan.
We let Gargantua pull us down close to her horizon.
Then a powered slingshot around, launching us towards Edmunds' planet.
- Manually?
- That's what I'm here for.
I'm gonna take us just inside the critical orbit.
- What about time slippage?
- Neither of us has time to worry... about relativity right now, Dr. Brand.
I'm sorry, Cooper.
Once we've gathered enough speed around Gargantua... we use Lander 1... and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to... push us out of the black hole's gravity.
The Lander's linkages have been destroyed... so we'll have to control manually.
Once Lander 1 is spent, TARS will detach...
And get sucked into that black hole.
Why does TARS have to detach?
We have to shed the weight to escape the gravity.
Newton's third law.
The only way humans have ever figured out of getting somewhere... is to leave something behind.
Cooper, you can't ask TARS to do this for us.
He's a robot.
So you don't have to ask him to do anything.
Cooper, you asshole!
Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.
It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.
It's our only chance to save people on Earth.
If I can find a way to transmit the quantum data I'll find in there... they might still make it.
Let's just hope there's still someone there to save.
Maximum velocity achieved.
Prepare to fire escape thrusters.
Ready?
Ready.
Ready.
Main engine ignition in three... two... one.
Mark.
Lander 1 engines, on my mark.
Three... two... one.
Mark.
Ranger 2 engines, on my mark.
Three, two, one...
- Mark.
- Fire!
This little maneuver's gonna cost us 51 years!
You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!
Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.
Three, two... one.
Mark.
Detach!
- Goodbye, TARS.
- Goodbye, Dr. Brand.
- See you on the other side, Coop.
- See you there, Slick!
Okay, CASE.
- Nice reckless flying!
- Learned from the master.
- Ranger 2, prepare to detach.
- What?
No! No! Cooper!
What are you doing?
Newton's third law.
You got to leave something behind.
You told me we had enough resources for both of us.
We agreed, Amelia... 90 percent.
Don't.
Detach.
Okay, I am nosing down.
Approaching the event horizon.
Portside, dipping down beneath it... to go through it.
Heading towards blackness.
I have a visual of the event.
It's all black.
TARS, do you read me?
It's all blackness.
TARS! Do you read me? Over.
Okay.
Screens... getting interference.
Losing control of the stick. I got flashes.
Flashes of lightness and blackness.
The turbulence in the gravity is increasing.
Ah.
The computers are going down. Agh.
Gravitational pull.
I'm losing control of the stick.
Murph?
Murph, come on!
Eject. Eject.
Eject.
Eject.
Eject.
Eject.
Murph.
Murph!
Murph!
Murph!
Murph!
No, no, no!
Murph!
Murph!
No!
No!
If you're leaving, just go.
No, no. No.
No, don't go.
Don't go, you idiot.
Don't go!
Morse. Morse.

Murph, we don't have time for this!
Come on!

"Stay!"
Come on.
Come on, Murph. Come on!
What's it say? What's it say, Murph?
What's it say?
"Stay."
Tell him, Murph.
Make him stay.
Make him stay, Murph.
Make him stay, Murph.
Don't let me leave, Murph!
Don't let me leave, Murph!
No!
No!
No!
It was you.
You were my ghost.
Cooper.
Cooper. Come in, Cooper.
- TARS?
- Roger that.
- You survived.
- Somewhere... in their fifth dimension.
They saved us.
Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?
And just why would they want to help us?
I don't know, but they constructed this three-dimensional space... inside their five-dimensional reality to allow you to understand it.
Yeah, that ain't working.
Yes, it is.
You've seen that time is represented here as a physical dimension.
You have worked out that you can exert a force across space-time.
Gravity to send a message.
Affirmative.
Gravity... can cross the dimensions, including time.
Apparently.
Do you have the quantum data?
Roger. I have it.
I am transmitting it on all wavelengths, but nothing is getting out, Cooper.
I can do this. I can do this.
But such complicated data to a child?
Not just any child.
What else?
Oh, come on, Dad.
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!
Even if you communicate it here, she won't understand its significance for years.
I get that, TARS.
But we've got to figure something out or the people on Earth are gonna die.
Think!
Cooper... they didn't bring us here to change the past.
Say that again.
They didn't bring us here to change the past.
No, they didn't bring us here at all.
We brought ourselves.
TARS, give me the coordinates for NASA in binary.
In binary. Roger. Feeding data.
"It's not a ghost."
"it's gravity."
Don't you get it yet, TARS?
I brought myself here!
We're here to communicate with the three-dimensional world.
We're the bridge!
I thought they chose me.
- But they didn't choose me, they chose her.
For what, Cooper?
To save the world.
All of this is one little girl's bedroom. Every moment.
It's infinitely complex.
They have access to infinite time and space, but they're not bound by anything!
They can't find a specific place in time. They can't communicate.
That's why I'm here.
I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph... just like I found this moment.
- How, Cooper?
- Love, TARS, love.
It's just like Brand said. My connection with Murph, it is quantifiable. it's the key!
What are we here to do?
Find how to tell her.
The watch.
The watch.
That's it.
We code the data into the movement of the second hand.
TARS, translate the data into Morse and feed it to me.
Translating data to Morse.
Cooper, what if she never came back for it?
She will. She will.
Murph, I can see his car!
He's coming, Murph!
Okay. I'm coming down.
How do you know?
Because I gave it to her.
Roger.
Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.
Dot-dot... dash-dot.
Dot-dash-dot-dot.
Dash-dash-dash.
Dash, dash, dash.
He came back!
It was him all the time!
I didn't know. it was him!
Dad's gonna save us.
Eureka!
It's traditional.
Eureka!
Did it work?
I think it might have.
How do you know?
Because the bulk beings are closing the tesseract.
Don't you get it yet, TARS?
They're not "beings."
They're us.
What I've been doing for Murph, they're doing for me.
For all of us.
Cooper, people couldn't build this.
No. No, not yet.
But one day.
Not you and me. But people.
A civilization that's evolved past the four dimensions we know.
What happens now?
Mr. Cooper.
All right. Let's take it slow, sir.
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.
Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.
Actually, you are 124 years old.
Take it slow, sir.
You were, uh, extremely lucky.
The Rangers found you with only minutes left in your oxygen supply.
Where am I?
Cooper Station.
Currently orbiting Saturn.
Cooper Station.
Nice of you to name it after me.
What?
The station isn't named after you, sir.
It's, uh, named after your daughter.
Although she's always maintained just how important you were.
Is she still alive?
She'll be here in a couple weeks.
She is far too old to be transferring from another station... but when she heard that you'd been found... well, this is, uh, Murphy Cooper we're talking about.
Yes, it is.
We'll have you checked out of here in a couple days.
I'm sure you'll be excited to see what's in store.
I actually, uh, did a paper on you in high school.
I know all about your life back on Earth.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
If... If you'll follow me, we've got a really good situation for you.
So, uh, when I made my suggestion to Miss Cooper...
I was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect.
It was just constant. Just that steady blow of dirt.
Of course, I didn't speak to her personally.
We always set the plate upside-down.
Glasses or cups, whatever it was, upside-down.
Well, my dad was a farmer. Uh, like everybody else back then.
There just wasn't enough food.
We wore little things, little strips... of sheet over our nose and mouth so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.
Well, it was pretty exciting for me because it was hope.
I don't care who describes it, there is no way for it to be exaggerated. It was that bad.
She did confirm just how much you loved farming.
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah.
Come here.
Home sweet home. Everything replaced and put back where it...
- Hey, is this...?
- Oh, yeah.
The machine we found out near Saturn when we found you. Yes.
Its, uh, power source was shot, but we could get you another one.
Yes. Please.
Settings.
General settings.
Security settings.
Honesty, new setting: 95 percent.
Confirmed.
Additional customization?
Humor: 75 percent.
Confirmed.
Auto self-destruct T-minus 10, nine...
Let's make that 60 percent.
Sixty percent confirmed.
- Knock-knock.
- You want 55?
Is this really what it was like?
It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.
I don't care much for this pretending we're back where we started.
I want to know where we are.
Where we're going.
- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.
- Yeah.
Family?
Yeah, they all came out to see her.
She's been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.
You told them I like farming.
It was me, Murph.
I was your ghost.
I know.
People didn't believe me.
They thought that I was doing it all myself.
But...
I knew who it was.
Nobody believed me. But I knew you'd come back.
How?
Because my dad promised me.
Well, I'm here now, Murph.
I'm here.
No.
No parent should have to watch their own child die.
I have my kids here for me now.
You go.
Where?
Brand.
She's out there... setting up camp.
Alone... in a strange galaxy.
Maybe right now she's settling in for the long nap... by the light of our new sun... in our new home.
Ten nine, eight seven, six five, four three, two one.
Dr. Serizawa?
Jerry Boyd.
I'm warning you, it's a mess.
It's just a total mess.
Monarch sent me in this morning.
Took a look around, but I told them we needed you.
They picked up a radiation pocket out here last month.
They got excited, thinking they had a uranium deposit.
They started stacking up the heavy machinery and then...
Well, the valley floor collapsed into a cavern below.
Just dropped away.
Just gone.
Best guess right now is about 40 miners went down with it.
This way.
When they first discovered this pocket, the radiation levels were only half as strong.
It's almost as if contact with the outside air started catalyzing something.
Some kind of fossils, right?
I've been digging holes for 30 years, I've never seen anything like it.
Oh, my God.
Is it possible?
Is it him?
No.
This is much older.
Hey, guys.
You gotta see this.
What is it?
Some kind of egg?
A dormant spore?
The bones are fossilized but this formation seems to be perfectly preserved.
This one looks broken.
It's like something came out of it.
I'll get it.
It's probably for me.
No, Takashi.
No. Takashi, just listen to me for a second.
I'm asking for the meeting because if I have to shut the reactor down you're not gonna want to read about it in a memo.
I've been following these tremors since they started in the Philippines and now they're in our own backyard.
No, no, no.
Hayato says I need to go through you about this.
Look, I'm just trying to follow the protocols set forth by the company.
It's my job.
He's awake.
Oh, I know.
He got up early.
What are we gonna do?
Get dressed.
I'll figure it out.
"Okay? "Okay
Later, Dad.
With all due respect, Takashi, and honor respect and honor, with all of that I'm an engineer.
I don't like unexplained frequency patterning near a plant where I'm responsible.
I need a meeting.
Make it happen.
Bye. Mom!
He made you a sign.
- What?
- Your birthday sign.
- He worked so hard.
- Oh, God.
I'm gonna come home early.
I'll take the car and pick him up and we can get a proper cake.
Okay?
Listen, I need to know that it's not the sensors.
I can't be calling this meeting and look like the American maniac.
So when we get there don't even bother coming up.
Just grab a team and go down to Level 5.
You're not a maniac.
I mean, you are, just not about this.
Must be something we're not thinking of.
Happy birthday.
What?
Is it...?
- Yes, it is.
Ha, ha.
- Oh, I forgot all about it.
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
I should have a birthday more often.
Ha, ha.
What is this?
Seismic anomaly.
This graph is minutes.
X is minutes, not days.
This is now.
Wait, hold on.
Seismic activity?
Seismic?
You're talking about earthquakes?
No, earthquakes are random, jagged.
This is consistent, increasing.
This is a pattern.
All right.
Let's make this quick.
Takashi.
What the hell is going on?
Have you seen this?
Yeah.
Maybe not such good time for a meeting.
What's the source?
Where's the epicenter?
We don't know.
But it keeps getting stronger.
It's gotta be centered somewhere.
Hayato.
No one else is reporting it.
We are contacting every other plant in the Kanto region.
Tokai, Fujiyama.
They're unaffected.
But my guess is these readings are just aftershocks from the Philippine earthquake.
Are we at full function?
Yes, we are.
But perhaps we should be drawing down, to be safe.
Take us offline.
- Now, Joe...
- Do it!
Now.
Wind it down.
Sandra.
Sandra, are you there?
We're turning back.
Let's go.
Oh, my God.
Joe, are you there?
Joe, there's been a breach.
We're heading back to the containment seal.
Listen.
You need to get out of there.
If there's been a reactor breach, you won't last five minutes with or without the suits.
Do you hear me?
I hear you.
We're coming!
I'll meet them there myself.
Put the safety doors on manual override.
I cannot do that!
Keep the doors open.
My wife is still in there!
Come on let's go!
Tell me this door's on manual.
Yeah.
But we are starting to breach!
I'm here.
Soon as they're through, I'll seal it.
Sandra, can you hear me?
I'm at the door.
Sandra?
Sandra, I'm waiting for you.
I'm at the checkpoint.
But you have to run as fast as you can.
I am!
Kenji.
Kenji we need to go!
Joe!
Close the door!
Seal the corridor or the whole city will be exposed.
Sandra?
- Joe?
Joe, can you hear me?
- Yes.
- Are you there?
- Sandra, I'm here.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Joe, it's too late.
We're not coming.
No, don't say that!
Don't you say that!
Run as hard as you can, honey.
Joe, you have to close the door.
You have to live for our son.
- Joe, seal the door!
Now! - Oh, my God.
Five seconds!
Four seconds!
I'm sorry.
Take care of Ford.
Be a good father.
I Will.
We didn't make it.
Let's go out!
Hurry!
Come on!
Ford!
On your feet!
You got family waiting for you?
I hope so.
How long you been away?
Fourteen months.
Take it slow.
It's the one thing they don't train you for.
All right!
Let's go!
- I can't tell you.
- Can I see it?
Don't let him see.
Whoa.
Oh, my God.
- It's a welcome home cake.
- Look at that.
That's you.
- And that's me.
- What's it say?
"Welcome home, Daddy."
Daddy's home.
- Daddy's home.
- Cake every night.
- Yeah, that's not happening.
- Daddy's home equals cake every night.
How did you manage to get chocolate on your eyeball?
- Daddy did it.
- Heh.
I can't sleep with you...
- ...making all this noise.
- Hee-hee-hee.
Come on, let's get you into bed.
Okay, big man.
Time to hit the rack.
Dad?
Yeah?
Are you still gonna be here tomorrow?
Yeah.
Come on, let's get some sleep.
Turns around, nose-to-nose, he says, "At ease, lieutenant."
God, I missed your laugh.
I missed you.
Mm-mm.
- I should get that.
No, it could be work.
- Mm-mm.
- I need to get that.
- You don't need to.
Come on.
Hello?
Yeah, this is Mrs. Brody.
Tell him you're busy tending to your husband's needs.
Shh.
Yeah, he's my husband.
Tell them we're not gonna buy it.
Yes, sir.
Could you just hold on one moment?
It's the consulate.
Joe's been arrested in Japan.
Elle, I can't find my pants.
They're in the other drawer.
So why was he trespassing in the quarantine zone?
Ugh.
Why do you think?
The lone crusader for the truth.
All his crackpot cuckoo theories.
Your father is a good man.
He just needs your help right now.
Ford, he's lost everything.
Yeah, so did I. But you know what?
I got over it.
Right.
I can see that.
I'm sorry.
It's just...
Every time I let him in close, he always tries to drag me back.
And I can't.
I can't put our family through that.
Well, he is your family.
Hey.
Come here.
You know you're only gonna be gone for a few days, right?
And then you are gonna come back to me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not the end of the world.
Papa.
I don't get many visitors.
Clearly.
This is you here.
Even, uh, Ph.D.'s don't get much teaching English as a second language.
Here we go.
And a towel.
All right.
So how's the bomb business?
It must be a growth area these days.
It's called "explosive ordnance disposal."
My job isn't dropping bombs.
It's stopping them.
- Dad.
- Hey how's Elle doing?
And Sam.
Oh, my God.
He must be what?
Three?
Three and a half?
He's almost 5.
I thought you were over this. "Echolocation"?
- Oh, hey.
- "Parasitic communication..."
Please don't, if you don't mind.
I have everything the way I like it.
I'm just...
I'm studying bioacoustics.
What were you doing, going back there?
- This trespassing stuff, that was bull.
- You broke the law.
I was trying to get back to our old house.
- In a quarantine zone.
- Precisely.
The new readings are exactly like they were on that day and I can prove it to you.
With a little luck, if I can get back to the house I can show you and the world this was not from a natural disaster.
This was...
Dad!
Your mom's out there, Ford.
To me she'll always be there.
They evacuated us so quickly.
I don't even have a picture of her.
This has to stop.
You know I did everything I could.
You know that, right?
Let me take you home.
Come home with me.
I got a little boy who's desperate to see his grandpa.
We can leave tomorrow.
What are you doing?
I'm heading back out there, Ford.
- No. I don't think so.
- One hour, in and out.
I have to go!
I came back here and wasted six years staring through that barbed wire, thinking it was a military mistake or some horrible design flaw they were covering up.
One day I met a guy who runs a cargo boat offshore.
Every day he goes right past the reactor site.
So he places a couple frequency monitors on buoys for me.
Two weeks ago...
I check this thing like every other day just for the kick.
Two weeks ago, I'm tuning in and, oh, my God there it is.
Whatever "it" is that's in there.
Whatever it is they're guarding so carefully started talking again.
And I mean talking.
Ha, ha.
I have to go back to our house.
I need my old disks, if they're still there.
I need the data to be able to prove a baseline here that this isn't a fantasy, that I'm not what you think I am.
I'm gonna find the truth and end this.
Whatever it takes.
Why can't you just let it rest?
Because I sent her down there, son.
This wasn't just a reactor meltdown.
I don't wanna hear this.
I know.
I know you don't.
But you can't keep running away.
And, son, you can't bury this in the past.
What spooked them?
Dad, come on.
Let's go.
It's only another two blocks.
Dad!
Are we going home, or what?
Whoa!
Hey, what are you doing?
Dad?
It's clean.
I knew it.
The radiation in this place should be lethal, but there's nothing.
Thank God.
Are they rebuilding the plant?
I don't know.
I haven't seen...
Ten seconds.
Ten seconds.
Seven-point-two seconds and getting stronger.
We're trending exponentially.
That's our new curve.
Jesus, it's worse than we thought.
Excuse me, Dr. Serizawa?
Two men were just arrested in the Q-zone.
We've got bigger problems here.
Have Dr. Graham take a look.
She did, sir.
She sent me.
One of them says he used to work here, doctor.
You are not fooling anybody when you say that what happened 15 years ago...
Found these disks in his bag.
...was a natural disaster.
Not sure what to make of them.
Not an earthquake, it wasn't a typhoon.
Okay?
So stop...
Look, I'm tired of talking to you about this.
I want my son.
I wanna see my son.
I wanna know that he's all right.
This guy, this guy knows.
He knows where he is.
I want my son.
And I want my bag and disks.
And I wanna talk to somebody in charge, not you.
No, not you.
I'm done talking to you.
All right?
You're looking at me right now, like I'm in a fish tank, right?
Fine.
Because I know what happened here.
And you keep telling everybody that this place is a death zone, but it's not.
You're lying.
Because what's really happening is that you're hiding something out there.
I'm right, aren't I?
My wife died here!
Something killed my wife.
And I have a right to know!
I deserve answers!
All these items they were found on him.
- And the date.
- I thought all of the data from that day was lost.
I guess not.
You see?
You see?
There it is again.
That is not a transformer malfunction.
That is an electromagnetic pulse.
It affects everything electrical for miles and miles and it is happening again.
This is what caused everything in the first place.
Don't you see that?
And it is gonna send us back to the Stone Age.
You have no idea what's coming.
Pulses are seconds apart.
They're getting stronger.
It's affecting the power grid.
Any radiation leakage?
Gamma levels are still zero.
It sucked all three reactors dry.
It's done feeding.
What's this?
- It's the same pattern.
- Fifteen years ago...
- ...it's what caused the meltdown.
- An electromagnetic pulse.
That's what it's building to.
Converting all that radiation until it hatches.
We have to shut down.
Secure the grid.
Wildfire protocols.
All personnel, clear the first perimeter immediately!
What's going on?
Hey, where you going?
Grid's secure.
Kill it.
All readings are flatlined.
Ahem.
Get a visual.
Jesus.
Check the grid.
Hit us with an EMP.
We're losing power!
- Get the backup generators online.
- Working on it.
That pulse fried every circuit.
- Check the cage.
- Trying the backup generators.
Here we go.
Everybody out!
Now!
Hey!
Let me out!
Hey!
No!
No, wait!
Stop!
Ford!
Dad!
It was unlike anything I've ever experienced before.
Yeah, it's, uh, Ford Brody.
Japan to San Francisco.
Okay, could I at least...
if you could let me leave you my cell...
Hello?
Damn it!
I'm sorry.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
Daddy's gonna be okay.
Daddy's gonna be okay.
This area is now under Naval military jurisdiction.
All personnel must report to the duty officer for debriefing.
Dr. Serizawa!
Dr. Serizawa!
Dr. Serizawa.
Captain Russell Hampton.
Glad to find you.
I've been briefed on your work with Operation Monarch.
Now, I'm told your organization has situational awareness of our unidentified creature?
Is that right?
We are now taking over operational authority from Monarch.
So I'm gonna need you to come with me.
Is there any other personnel you need?
They'll take care of you.
I'll be right next to you.
Okay.
Them.
- Let's get his vitals.
- Shh.
Shh.
- Dad. Dad.Radial pulse is weak.
I'm counting 125.
It's okay.
You were right.
I'm sorry.
Go home to your family.
You keep them safe.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Whatever it takes.
Whatever it ta...
Hey, stay with me.
Dad?
- Dad? Radial pulse is weaker.
Barely feel it.
We're losing him.
- Joe, can you hear me?
- He's going into A-fib.
Give me another epi, one milligram, and 40 units of vasopressin.
Stay with us.
Come on, Joe.
Hang in there, buddy.
This is our needle in a haystack, people.
MUTO.
Massive unidentified terrestrial organism.
It is, however, no longer terrestrial.
It is airborne.
The world still thinks this was an earthquake and it would be preferable that that remain so.
Before we lost sight, it was headed east across the Pacific and had emitted enough EMP disruption to create havoc with our radar and satellite feeds and reduce us, for the moment, to a strictly visual pursuit.
I emphasize "for the moment" because we will get on our game and we will find this thing.
It is imperative that we do so.
Captain, I want any...
- ...and all search options on this table ASAP.
- Yes, sir.
Dr. Serizawa.
Admiral William Stenz.
- Nice to meet you.
- Glad to have you on board.
Sensei.
Excuse me.
Authorities issued a statement...
Brody's dead.
...claiming the nuclear contamination is at no risk of spreading, even as the death toll rises.
Lieutenant Brody?
Dr. Serizawa.
My condolences.
We are deeply sorry for your loss, lieutenant.
But I'm afraid we need your help.
This is the USS Nautilus.
In 1954 the first time a nuclear submarine ever reached the lower depths...
- ...it awakened something.
- The Americans first thought that it was the Russians.
The Russians thought that it was them.
All those nuclear bomb tests in the '50s...?
Not tests.
They were trying to kill it.
Him.
- An ancient alpha predator.
- Millions of years older than mankind.
From an age when the Earth was 10 times more radioactive than today.
This animal and others like it consumed this radiation as a food source.
As the levels on the surface naturally subsided these creatures adapted to live deeper in the oceans.
Further underground.
Absorbing radiation from the planet's core.
The organization we work for, Monarch, was established in the wake of this discovery.
A multinational coalition formed in secrecy to search for him.
Study him.
Learn everything we could.
We call him Gojira.
The top of a primordial ecosystem.
A god, for all intents and purposes.
- A monster.
- Fifteen years ago we found a fossil of another giant animal in the Philippines.
Like Gojira.
But this creature died long ago.
Killed by these.
Parasitic spores.
One dormant.
But the other hatched.
Catalyzed when a mining company unknowingly drilled into its tomb.
The hatchling burrowed straight for the nearest source of radiation your father's power plant in Janjira and cocooned there for 15 years, absorbing its radioactive fuel...
- ...to gestate, to grow.
- Until it hatched like a butterfly into the creature you saw today.
Wait.
You knew about this?
This thing?
The whole time?
Why didn't you...
- ...kill it when you had the chance?
- It was absorbing radiation from the reactors.
We worried killing it might release that radiation and endanger millions.
That's why our mission was to contain it.
To study its biology, to understand it.
We knew the creature was having an electrical effect on everything within a close proximity.
What we didn't know was that it could harness this same power in an EMP attack.
But your father did.
He predicted it.
What else did he say?
Please try to remember, Mr. Brody.
Anything that would help us.
Anything at all.
I didn't listen.
I just thought he was crazy.
He was obsessed with all this...
Said something about an animal call.
Something talking.
Talking?
He said he was studying something.
Echolocation.
If the MUTO was talking that day your father must have discovered something talking back.
- Check again.
- Yup.
Search for a response call.
This parasite.
It's still out there.
Where's it headed?
The MUTO is young growing.
It will be looking for food.
Sources of radiation.
We're monitoring all known sites but if we don't find it soon...
Then what?
Nature has an order.
A power to restore balance.
I believe he is that power.
Sir, right now we're 50 miles from Hawaii.
This transport will take you there.
You're catching a commercial flight back to San Francisco.
I'm gonna need you to brush your teeth.
- Disgusting!
Those are terrible!
- Ha, ha.
We gotta brush them!
Citizens within a 100-mile radius are being temporarily evacuated from the area.
Hey, this is Elle.
You missed me.
Please leave a message.
Elle.
I don't know what they're saying on the news.
There was an accident in Japan.
Dad's gone.
I'll explain when I see you.
I'm headed to Hawaii.
I'm gonna catch a flight from there.
I'll see you soon.
Keep scrolling.
Near the end.
Before the EMP.
There.
Something responded.
Aloha, and welcome aboard.
The train will begin moving shortly.
For the comfort of others, no smoking, please.
Thank you.
Please remember to stay clear of the automatic doors.
Akio!
Mama!
Mama!
Hey, hey, hey.
Mama!
I can't open it.
Look, don't worry.
Just wait there.
I'll bring him back.
Okay?
- Mama!
- Hey, hey.
Mama!
- Whoa.
Hey.
Whoa, kid.
- Mama!
It's okay.
I'm gonna bring him back.
All right.
I'm gonna set you down there.
I'll get you back to your parents.
Okay?
Here.
Is this what you want?
Take good care of him for me.
I better not miss my flight, kid.
Admiral, received an intel report.
We lost track of a nuclear Akula 50 nautical miles northwest of Hawaii.
Could be the MUTO.
Just got word of a missing Russian sub in the North Pacific.
Martinez?
Aye.
Special Forces Team Sparta 1 is picking up a distress signal northwest of Diamond Head on the island of Oahu.
They're on the ground, headed to the beacon.
...on 5. 23 north-northeast of the last beacon.
Moving in on foot.
Wanna tell me why we're looking for an Akula in the jungle?
Probably a glitch.
Russians said they got a ping from this location.
Hey, I got a reading.
It's right up ahead.
Sparta 1, this is Hawkeye.
We're getting the same ping off the transponder.
Range 30 meters.
Looks like you're getting warm.
What the hell?
Jesus.
Oh, my God.
Guardian 3, we located your Russian sub.
You're not gonna believe what else we found.
Holy shit.
It appears to be rising approximately 20 to 30 meters above the tree line.
We can't tell how wide it is.
Cat's out of the bag, doctor.
No more secrets.
Our highest priority now is safety.
There's close to a million people on that island.
Get me eyes in the air.
We're picking up something else.
Approaching from the Pacific.
We need to check out that object.
General quarters.
Bridge, this is the captain.
- Where you going?
- Up to the flight deck.
I think he is coming.
What are you doing?
I have to see this.
Whoa.
Two Charlie Six, we are circling the target.
Go on your command.
Stand by, got a visual.
Bogey at my 12.
Be advised.
Prepare to engage target.
We're getting movement down here.
Take cover!
Control, I have no power.
I say again, I've lost all...
You all right?
You give it 10 seconds, lights gonna come back on.
It's okay.
- What was that?
- Did you see that?
What is it?
Dad!
Zoe?
Zoe!
Oh, my God.
Run.
Run!
Tsunami!
Tsunami!
Target spotted offshore two knots due east of your position.
Anybody hurt?
- Anyone get an eyeball on the bogey?
- Where is he?
There you go.
What did I tell you?
...please. Thank you.
Get down!
Let's go!
Remember to stay clear of the doors.
Go, go, go!
Target in sight...
- ...two o'clock, 300 meters.
- We're on 6-X-01.
Target confirmed.
Jesus!
Can you tell us what happened?
... and everybody started running and screaming.
Sam, please turn that TV off.
Hey, did you hear me?
Off.
Come on, Sammy.
Let's go.
Let's go.
It's bedtime.
- Sammy.
- Mommy, look.
Dinosaurs.
Attention, please.
Incoming patients...
- ...please proceed...
- Excuse me.
Hi.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
This boy's been separated from his parents.
Fill this out.
Be with you in just a minute.
Hey, you got service on that cell phone?
No. The pay phones don't even work.
- Akio!
- Akio!
Mama!
Papa!
Corporal, load up, load up.
Sergeant.
Lieutenant Brody, U.S. Navy.
I need your help.
I'm trying to get to the mainland.
It's your lucky day.
Everything not tied down is moving east.
- Whoa, is that where they're heading?
- Yeah.
I guess we're monster hunters now.
Satellite transfer complete.
Simulations uploaded.
Satellite tracking continues.
Last satellite tracks predict the MUTO continuing due east.
All our models have the targets converging on the Pacific Coast.
As of now, it looks like Godzilla's still following the MUTO.
He's hunting.
Have all vessels maintain current distance from target.
And plot the speed and heading of these things.
I wanna know exactly when and where they'll make landfall.
Yes, sir.
Doctor, what did you mean by "hunting"?
You think it's chasing this MUTO?
But if the MUTO is his prey...
The signal shows a call.
- Why call up a predator?
- No, it didn't.
I think Godzilla was only listening.
The MUTO was calling something else.
The pattern.
Focus the search on Nevada.
Nevada?
Why would it go to Nevada?
- It can't be.
It's impossible.
- What's impossible?
There was another spore, intact, found in the Philippine mine.
But we vivisected it.
Ran every test on it for years.
You confirmed it for yourself.
It was dormant!
Maybe not anymore.
This spore.
Where is it now, doctor?
It was highly radioactive.
It was disposed of.
The Americans, they took it.
Doctor, where is it?
Where you put all your nuclear waste.
Go, go, go!
Right, let's go!
Give me a Mark I eyeball on every vault.
Clear!
Clear!
Clear!
- Clear!
- Clear!
Clear!
- Clear!
- Clear!
Hey!
Is anyone in there?
Captain, our UAVs have footage of the new MUTO.
Let's have a look.
Yes, sir.
This is from five minutes ago.
My God.
Playing all we have now.
It's almost 300 feet.
It's far bigger than the other one.
But this one doesn't have any wings.
A different sex?
A female.
That's who he's been talking to.
It must be a mating call.
The female remained dormant until the male matured.
Now they're seeking radiation.
To reproduce.
Current tracking models indicate that all three targets are converging here:
San Francisco Bay.
But if we rig a nuclear warhead with a shielded timer put it on a boat and send it 20 miles out the radiation lures the MUTOs and the MUTOs lure Godzilla.
And we detonate, with minimal fallout risk to the city.
You can't be serious.
They feed on radiation.
Correct.
That's why we use the bomb as bait.
And kill them...
- ...with the sheer force of the blast.
- This is crazy.
Doctor, if you have any other ideas, I am all ears.
Admiral.
Yes, doctor?
Gojira may be the answer.
I believe.
...he's here to restore balance.
He can defeat them.
And what?
We just stand by and watch?
I'm sorry, doctor.
I can't take that risk.
Prep the warheads and get them moving to the coast.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
I know you don't agree with this.
But my first priority is to safeguard our citizens.
It's stopped.
Yes.
Eight-fifteen in the morning.
August 6, 1945.
Hiroshima.
It was my father's.
Heads up.
We've got new destination, new orders.
Let's get geared up.
Hey, tech sergeant.
What's the word?
Another one of those things popped up in Nevada, sir.
Okay, everybody out.
Can't fly any further.
We're well in range of its EMP.
So from here on out, it's on the ground or it's not at all.
Let's go!
All right, listen up!
This train and these weapons are headed to San Francisco.
Anyone not part of this mission, disembark now!
Negative.
Can't do it, sir.
This is a high-risk mission.
That train is a national asset, not Amtrak.
- We good to go?
- Just about.
From the look of the casings on those Minuteman ICBMs guessing the digital module's been bypassed and you're prepping for full analog retrofit.
Is my jaw supposed to drop?
I get it.
You're EOD.
- I got my crew, they know what they're doing.
- Aim the pointy end at the monsters, right, sarge?
When was the last time you let one of your guys put their fingers in a live bomb?
Look, this is what I do.
This is my job.
Master sergeant.
My family's in the city.
Okay?
I need to get on that train.
You heard the spokesman say that the White House has not ruled out the use of nuclear force.
Sam, your mom's gonna be right back.
Emergency, can I help you?
Hello?
Oh, yeah, just a sec.
Elle, for you.
- Tell them I'll be there in a minute.
- Elle.
It's your husband.
Hello?
Elle?
Ford?
Oh, God.
- You all right? How's Sam?
- I've been calling you everywhere.
- You okay'?
- I'm fine.
- I've got Sam with me. - Great.
Because I wanna get you both...
Can't believe this is happening.
Ford.
You okay?
Are you doing okay?
I'm okay.
Elle, please don't worry.
Baby, I'm so scared right now.
I know.
I'm gonna be at the hospital by sunrise.
Then I'll get you and Sam out.
Okay.
The military has a plan to deal with these things.
I'm coming to get you both, okay?
Okay.
Can you please just hurry?
I Will.
Elle?
I just wanted you to know that I love you.
I love you too.
Just be safe.
I'll see you soon.
Good to go!
Let's move out!
As blackouts and electrical interference radiate farther and farther west citizens within 200 miles of the creature's current sphere of influence are being urged to please find shelter stay indoors and stay off the roads.
911, what's your emergency?
...kids in the car.
...debris going back about two miles.
This girl is not breathing.
... people that are hurt.
Send somebody out here now!
Yes, sir.
Yes, warheads are on the move.
I completely agree, sir.
All right, people.
Let's go.
I need to know the exact location of the MUTOs ASAP.
Aye.
We're updating our models with the current tracking data now.
Admiral.
Yes?
Please don't do this.
I understand your concerns, doctor.
But I am sacrificing lives every minute trying to steer one of these things clear of population centers and now there are two more on the way.
There are millions of lives at risk.
So all I want to know from you is:
Will it work and can they be killed?
But we tried that before.
We're talking dialable yield.
Megatons, not kilotons.
Nothing can withstand that blast.
Makes the bomb we tried to kill it with in '54 look like a firecracker.
- Sergeant Morales.
Give me a hand.
- I thought these nukes...
- ...all detonated by remote control.
- The MUTOs knock out everything electric.
Including detonators.
Can't even get in range without these things going haywire.
But this?
This, on the other hand, is old-school.
Clockwork.
Takes a licking...
- ...keeps on ticking.
- Heh.
Holy shit.
Sergeant Morales, get down here with that radio.
On the double.
Move, move!
Snake Eyes, this is Bravo to November. ls the bridge clear?
Over.
I say again:
We got a train of VIP cargo headed for the coast.
Is the bridge clear?
Over.
Snake Eyes, I need a sitrep.
Are the tracks clear?
We are at phase line yellow.
In the next 10 mikes, we're advancing to phase line red.
Secure or not?
Over.
You think it's intact?
Only one way to find out.
- You wanna take the top?
- Sure.
You check below.
Sergeant Morales, you come with me.
Shit.
Jesus.
- Jones, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm good!
The bridge is intact.
Bulldog, this is Eagle.
All clear to move out.
Over.
Roger that, Eagle.
Let's go!
Let's go, people!
Say again.
I do not have a visual.
What is your position?
Over.
Unreadable.
Say again.
Over.
Hit the deck.
Help me turn it off, man.
Run!
Move it, run!
Ford!
Aah!
He's going under!
Boats, sound the collision alarm.
Frame 180.
We're losing visual, admiral.
He's diving.
Changing course and moving fast.
I've got him at 33 knots and picking up speed.
He's gonna outrun us, sir.
Watch the swinging!
No swing!
Hey!
Hold on!
Medic!
They are insisting civilians make their way to the BART stations.
BART stations are designated shelters.
These patients are my responsibility.
Where are you taking them?
Across the bridges.
Critical and children only.
Shelters are gonna fill up fast.
Trust me, they'll be safer outside the city.
- I can take Sam.
- No, no, no.
Ford's on his way.
If you change your mind, the buses leave in 10 minutes.
Come on.
Where are you, Ford?
This way!
Keep them moving!
Let's go.
Come on, come on.
Hey!
Where are they taking it?
Twenty miles offshore, convergence point.
We're gonna lure them there.
Three birds, one stone.
Wait!
Okay, Sammy.
Laura, thank God.
Sammy, you remember Laura.
She's Mommy's work friend, right?
She's gonna look after you for a little bit.
Daddy's gonna be here soon.
And I'm gonna just come get you right after.
I promise.
Okay.
Okay?
Come on, sweetheart.
You're gonna come with me.
Your mom's gonna stay and help.
Elle, I'm gonna take care of him, okay?
- Say, "Bye-bye, Mommy." Bye, Mommy.
I got him!
I got him!
Just sit down here.
Sit, sit.
Here.
Did you lose consciousness?
I'm okay.
Really, I'm fine.
Sitrep, please.
Location of targets?
Male MUTO was spotted 30 miles off the Farallon Islands.
Showing seismic activity to the east near Livermore.
Should be the female closing in.
Where's Godzilla?
Last contact was five hours ago.
Maintaining a bearing of 053 degrees, descending below a depth of 10,000 feet.
Be here within the hour.
Residents are trying to get out of the city any way they can.
There's still buses on that bridge.
Come on!
Let's get those busses through.
Let's go!
We're not gonna stop the buses here.
What?
I can't hear you.
Oh, kids please be quiet.
Move into position till you have a clean line of sight!
Portside!
Two hundred meters!
Brace!
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.
Holy shit.
Oh, shit!
- Hold on!
- Watch out!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Look out!
Get down!
Get down in your seats!
Please!
Get down!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Hey!
Move out!
Move, move, move!
Striker!
There's civilians on the bridge.
Hold your fire!
Open fire!
Move!
Move!
- All right, get in there!
- Prepare to arm the device!
Ready!
You got it?
I'm all set.
Arming keys!
Three!
Two!
One!
What the hell was that?
EMF .
Engine's stopped!
We lost power!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Fire!
- Incoming!
Sam Brody was checked into the Oakland Coliseum shelter an hour ago.
He is safe.
No record of Elle Brody.
Never made it out of the city.
Well, check again.
Please.
I told her to wait for me, and I didn't make it.
They are trying to get everyone downtown into subway shelters.
I'm sure your wife is fine.
Lieutenant Brody!
I'm looking for Lieutenant Brody.
- Are you Brody?
- Yes.
Okay.
The male delivered the warhead to the center of downtown.
That puts 100,000 civilians in the blast radius.
We can't stop it remotely.
An analog timer has been installed.
The MUTOs are frying electronics within a five-mile bubble.
Means approaching from ground is not an option.
That's why we'll be conducting a HALO insertion.
Jumping altitude Will be 30,000 feet.
We just skate to the top and drop.
Here.
And here.
If you don't hit a skyscraper on the way, meet at rally point Charlie.
- Right here.
Good?
- Doctor, any guesses where to look?
Underground.
If the MUTOs have spawned they'll be building a nest.
Captain, when you find the warhead...
- ...how long to disarm it?
- Without seeing...
- ...the analog mod, I couldn't even guess.
- Sixty seconds if I can access it.
I retrofitted that device myself.
Lieutenant Brody is our only EOD tech to survive the train attack.
Well, it sounds like we could use you.
With all due respect...
- ...if that doesn't work, then what's Plan B?
- The waterfront is located one klick downhill.
Get the bomb to the pier, onto a boat and as far away from the city as possible before it detonates.
Any questions?
- Dismissed.
- That's it.
Let's move.
Lieutenant?
They've already been briefed.
We have no extraction plan.
If you don't walk out, you don't come back at all.
Sir, I'll do whatever it takes.
This alpha predator of yours, doctor do you really think he has a chance?
The arrogance of man is thinking nature is in our control and not the other way around.
Let them fight.
Oh, Lord God, we give thanks for the opportunities you have given us going together as comrades to defend our great nation.
We thank you for the time and service that you have given us together.
Now as we are about to leave one another let us have the strength...
Take position!
Take position!
I saw Team 1 move to the east.
Two of our team members didn't make it.
I heard bits and pieces on the radio.
Snipers on the rooftop moving into position.
Here we go.
Picking up the nuke.
Which way?
One klick up the hill.
We found the warhead.
Let's go!
Up the hill, this direction.
Move.
Hey.
Hey.
Look.
Let's move, let's move.
On my six.
Sarge, get a look at this.
We gotta get moving.
You got a signal yet?
I got it.
It's down there.
All right, move, move!
Grab a line!
More light.
Grazer.
Right, clear out.
Here we go.
Whoa, look out, heads up!
How much time we got left?
We have 27 mikes.
We gotta get this thing down.
Move, move, I got you!
Move it out, move it out!
Careful!
Careful.
And down in three two one.
Let's get this cover off.
Lieutenant, you're up.
It's not budging.
It's sealed shut.
We need time to open it.
We don't have time!
We gotta get it on a boat.
Grab the warhead!
Let's move!
Go!
Easy.
Easy, easy.
Move it out, guys!
Lieutenant, let's go!
Lieutenant?
What the hell was that?
Holy shit!
Did you see that?
This way.
Faster, faster.
Let's get this thing started.
Find the ignition, sir?
Give me that pack.
Here you go.
Come on, come on.
Hurry.
Hurry it up.
Let's go, let's go!
She's coming for the bomb!
Let's get this weapon secured.
Unh!
Come on.
Come on.
Stay right here.
Quiet!
Quiet!
I hear some people. Come on!
This one's in bad shape.
Come on, grab my hand.
Help him up.
Help him up.
Please proceed to the marked tables...
- ...for registration.
- Let's make some room, please!
Mary!
Daddy!
Sam.
Mommy!
Sammy?
Mommy!
Mommy!
Sweetpea.
Hi!
Hi, baby.
Hi.
On, baby.
[Engine revs] [Breathing]
Max: My name is Max.
[Radio static] My world is fire and blood.
[Gunfire, screaming] Man #1: Why are you hurting these people?
Man #2: It's the oil, stupid.
Man #3:
Oil wars. Man #4: We are killing for guzzoline.
Woman: [Echoing] Guzzoline.
Woman #2: The world is actually running out of water.
Woman #3: [Echoing] Now there's the water wars.
Max:
Once, I was a cop, a road warrior searching for a righteous cause.
Man #5: ... To the terminal freak-out point.
Man #6: Mankind has gone rogue, terrorizing itself.
[Radio tuning] Robotic voice: Thermonuclear skirmish.
Woman #4: The earth is sour.
Woman #5: Our bones are poisoned.
Woman #6: We have become half-life.
[Screaming] Max:
As the world fell, each of us, in our own way, was broken.
It was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone else.
Girl: [Echoing] Hello?
Where are you?
Where are you, Max?
Woman: [Echoing] Max.
Here they come again.
Max rockatansky.
Worming their way into the black matter of my brain.
Help us, Max. You promised to help us.
I tell myself...
[Crunching] ...they cannot touch me.
They are long dead.
War boy: After him!
War boy #2: After him!
Now!
[Breathing heavily]
I am the one who runs from both the living and the dead, hunted by scavengers, haunted by those I could not protect.
[Indistinct shouting] So I exist in this wasteland.
A man reduced to a single instinct...
Survive.
[Echoing] Max?
Is that you?
Where were you?
[Echoing] Help us.
Where were you? Help us, Max. Where were you, Max?
Help us!
[Panting] [Echoing] Help us, Max.
Stop running.
You let us die.
You let us die!
You let us die! Girl: You promised to help us.
Why?
Witness!
[Coughing] Ace: We are war boys!
War boys! War boys! War boys!
War boys! Kamakrazee war boys!
War boys! War boys! War boys!
War boys! Fucacima kamakrazee war boys!
Hooked on!
Today we're headin' to gas town!
Gas town! Gas town! Gas town!
Gas town! Today we're haulin' aqua cola.
Aqua cola! Aqua cola! Aqua cola!
Aqua cola! Today we're haulin' produce!
Produce! Produce! Produce!
Produce! And today we're haulin' mother's milk!
Mother's milk! Mother's milk! Mother's milk!
Rev it up for the immortan Joe!
[Feedback]
[Echoing] Once again, we send off my war rig to bring back guzzoline from gas town and bullets from the bullet farm.
Once again, I salute my imperator, furiosa!
And I salute my half-life war boys who will ride with me eternal on the highways of Valhalla.
[War boys chanting "v-8!"] I am your redeemer!
It is by my hand you will rise from the ashes of this world!
[Cheering stops] It's comin'.
G-get ready.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
It's comin'.
Do not, my friends, become addicted to water.
It will take hold of you.
And you will resent its absence.
Winchman: Clear off!
Get 'em all off!
Clear off!
Signal gas town. Convoy's on its way.
I got a war boy runnin' on empty.
Hook up that full-life.
[Grunts] Hey!
Careful. That's a universal donor.
Boss, we're not going to gas town?
Bullet farm?
We're heading east.
I'll pass it down the line.
New orders!
Thunder up! Thunder up!
This is not a supply run!
Go. Go. Go.
Ace, what's going on?
We're heading east.
Why? I don't know.
That's the order.
Moo. Hey, pa.
Hm?
You know about this?
Your produce ain't going to gas town.
She's gone off-road...
Into hostile territory.
Why would she do that, dad?
Let me see. Let me see.
Rictus. I wanna see!
Rictus, go see what's agitating dad!
Splendid!
Angharad!
Where are they?
[Shotgun cocks] They are not your property.
Miss giddy?
You cannot own a human being.
Sooner or later someone pushes back!
Where is she taking them?
! She didn't take them. They begged her to go.
Where is she taking them?
A long way from you.
Hey, what's happening?
Slit.
What's going on?
Slit!
Treason, betrayal, an imperator gone rogue.
An imperator.
Who? Furiosa.
She took a lot of stuff from immortan Joe.
W-what stuff?
Breeders.
His prize breeders.
He wants them back.
Not a hand laid on 'em.
By my deeds, I honor him.
[Grunts] That's my wheel.
I'm driving.
You're my lancer.
I just promoted myself.
Not today.
Today is my day. Look at you!
If you can't stand up, you can't do war!
He's right, son.
I'm not staying here dying soft.
Ah, you're already a corpse.
I just need a top-up, some more juice.
There's no time!
We take my blood bag.
We take my blood bag and strap him to the lancer's perch.
It's got a muzzle on it. It's a raging feral.
That's right. High-octane crazy blood filling' me up.
If I'm gonna die...
I'm gonna die historic on the fury road.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Organic.
Organic mechanic:
Yeah? Hitch up his blood bag.
Right-o.
Yeah! Ah! How much more can they take from me?
They've got my blood.
Now it's my car!
Immortan!
Immortan Joe!
Ah! He looked at me!
He looked right at me!
He looked at your blood bag!
He turned his head.
He looked me straight in the eye.
He was scanning the horizon.
No.
[Air hissing] I am awaited.
I am awaited in Valhalla!
Confucamus!
Immortan!
Hey!
Heads up!
Heads up!
Boss!
We got vehicles from the citadel.
They're firing flares.
They want reinforcements from gas town and the bullet farm.
What is this?
Backup? Decoy?
It's a detour.
Eyes right.
Buzzards!
Buzzards right!
Eyes on!
Eyes on! Buzzards right!
Eyes on!
War boy: Eyes on!
Yeah! Should we turn it 'round and run 'em into our backup?
Furiosa:
No. We're good.
We fang it!
[Horn blares] Thunder up!
Here we go!
Prepare the gunners!
Morsov!
Come on, attack!
War!
Ready!
Nux: She's ours, slit!
She's ours.
First, we get the buzzards off her back!
Form up!
That's my head!
Get up!
You can do it!
Morsov!
War boy: Morsov!
No!
Witness me!
Witness! Witness!
Witness!
[Cheering] Slit: Mediocre, morsov!
Mediocre! Aah!
Ready!
[Indistinct shouting] Get ready!
Back me in!
They're coming!
We can't breathe down there!
Stay out of sight!
Now! Aah! Go back!
[Indistinct shouting] Hydraulics!
Hydraulics!
Yeah.
[Breathing heavily] Now we bring home the Booty.
She thinks she can lose us, dad.
She thinks we're stupid.
She thinks she can lose us in there!
Slit: Fang it!
Fang it!
Why can't you stop?
Crew!
Outta the way!
Out of the way!
What have you done?
We need counterweight. Get the blood bag down the back.
[Guitar wailing] Hunt them down!
Hunt them down!
Hey, head...
Say bye-bye to the neck!
Decapito!
We're goin' in, slit!
Come on!
We've almost got her!
Come on!
Hold it steady!
Oh, what a day!
What a lovely day!
I am the man... Who grabs the sun riding to Valhalla!
Witness me, blood bag!
Witness!
I live, I die, I live again!
We're not going back.
Water.
[Grunts] You.
Angharad, is that just the wind, or is it a furious vexation?
I got it!
Glory me, blood bag!
We snagged her alive.
He's gonna shred her.
Shred her!
Bolt cutters.
Chain.
Hey, hey!
Oh, look at them.
So shiny, so chrome.
He's gonna be so grateful.
We could ask for anything.
I wanna drive the war rig.
What are you gonna ask for?
That's my jacket.
[Chuckles] Sure.
I mean, you can ask for more than a jacket.
We're going to the green place.
Wait, it's you and me. [Grunts]
We're going to the green place of many mothers.
How does it feel?
It hurts.
Out here, everything hurts.
You wanna get through this?
Do as I say.
Now pick up what you can and run.
[Panting] Kill switches.
I set the sequence myself.
This rig goes nowhere without me.
You can get in.
Not without them.
So we wait.
You're relying on the gratitude of a very bad man.
You've already damaged one of his wives.
How grateful do you think he's gonna be?
You're sitting on 2,000 horsepower of nitro-boosted war machine.
I'd say you've got about a five-minute head start.
You want that thing off your face?
Let's go.
Of all the legs you had to shoot, that one was attached to his favorite.
Smeg!
[Snapping] You don't have to do it just because he tells you.
What choice does she have?
Toast: He's not gonna hurt us. He needs us.
Why?
To bargain.
Oh, he'll hurt us, all right.
Fragile: Do you think he's coming to the green place?
Never! He's a crazy smeg who eats schlanger!
Ah, stay out of there.
Behind you.
Huh?
[Grunts] The gas town boys.
[Growls] Don't damage the good.
Furiosa: What do you see?
Splendid: Big rigs.
Polecats.
Flamers.
And there's the people eater himself.
Coming to count the cost.
We're dragging something out back.
I think it's the fuel pod.
Max: No, no.
I'll go.
Filth!
You traited him!
Splendid: No unnecessary killing!
This war boy wants me dead!
We agreed!
He's kamakrazee!
He's just a kid at the end of his half-life.
No! I live, I die, I live again!
Hold him!
Tie him up!
Get off him.
Throw him out!
The dag: Chuck him out.
You got more friends.
[Nux grunting] Bullet farmer.
They're coming from the bullet farm.
Yeah?
It's over. You can't defy him.
[Spits] [Spits] Just watch us, mate.
He is the one who grabbed the sun. Toast: Look at how slick he's fooled you, war boy!
He's a lying old man.
By his hand, we'll be lifted up!
That's why we have his logo seared on our backs!
"Breeding stock!" "Battle fodder!"
No, I am awaited!
You're an old man's battle fodder!
Killing everyone and everything!
We're not to blame!
Then who killed the world?
I made a deal up ahead. Safe passage.
I don't know if it's still any good.
Get back in the hold!
Keep the hatch open.
I need you here.
You may have to drive the rig.
You.
You stay.
You stay there.
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.
I'm supposed to be alone. That was the deal.
Down here.
Hey.
What's your name?
What do I call you?
Does it matter?
[Sighs] Fine.
When I yell "fool,"
you drive out of here as fast as you can.
This is the sequence...
One. One, two.
One.
Red, black, go.
You have it?
It's all here!
Three thousand gallons of guzzoline, just like you asked!
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.
You drop the rocks.
Rock rider chief: You said, "a few vehicles in pursuit.
Maybe."
We count three war parties!
Yeah, well, I got unlucky.
Let's do this!
Fool!
That's our fuel!
Make way for the ripsaw!
[Engines revving] Immortan Joe:
Once I'm over, clear the rocks and bring everyone through.
Immortan!
Immortan Joe!
I got a war boy!
Says he was on the war rig!
You!
Climb aboard!
Slit:
Hey! Hey!
I got his boot!
I got the blood bag's boot!
Take me!
I got his boot!
All this for a family squabble.
Healthy babies.
Reload the clip.
I-I can't.
Gun!
Give the gun!
It's not loaded yet!
You!
Now!
We had a deal! [Indistinct shouting] Aah!
Rictus! The wives!
No more flames.
Immortan Joe: Splendid!
Splendid!
That's my child!
My property!
[Gunshot] Immorta...
Immortan, if I get on the rig, there's a way inside.
What is your name?
It's nux.
I'll pike her in the spine. Keep her breathing for ya.
No.
Put a bullet in her skull, stop the rig, return my treasures to me, and I myself will carry you to the gates of Valhalla.
Am I awaited?
You will ride eternal...
Shiny and chrome.
Rictus!
Help him aboard!
Ready?
Here we go!
[Scoffs] Mediocre!
Schlanger!
Capable: Look out!
Immortan Joe: Angharad!
Get out!
[Gasps] No!
Angharad!
Stop!
Turn the rig around!
Go back for her!
[Clears throat] No.
Tell him to turn the rig around!
Did you see it?
She went under the wheels. [Clears throat]
Did you see it?
She went under the wheels.
[Sobs] We keep moving.
No!
We keep moving!
He doesn't know what he's talking about!
Whatever happens, we're going to the green place.
The stupid green place.
We don't even know where to find it.
You all right?
On!
On!
Capable: Cheedo!
The dag: Cheedo, don't be stupid.
Stop!
He'll forgive us.
I know he will.
There is no going back!
We were his treasures!
Cheedo!
We were protected.
He gave us the high life.
What wrong with that?
We are not things.
[Gunshot] No!
[Gasps] Cheedo, we are not things!
We are not things.
I don't want to hear that again!
They were her words!
And now she's dead!
The dag: Wring your hands.
You're not going back to him.
Angharad!
Come on!
Come on!
So, um...
[Clears throat] Where is this...
This green place?
It's a long night's run, heading east.
Hm. We need inventory.
I want you to match every gun with its bullets.
I'm gonna go down and do some repairs.
We need someone down the back.
I'll go.
No.
I want you to stay together.
I can do it.
What are you doing here?
He saw it. He saw it all.
My own blood bag driving' the rig that killed her.
Stop doing that.
Shh, shh, shh. Stop.
Thr... three times the gates were open to me.
What gates?
I was awaited in Valhalla.
They were calling my name.
I should be walking with the immorta, mcfeasting with the heroes of all time.
I'd say it was your manifest Destiny not to.
I thought I was being spared for something great.
I got to drive a pursuit vehicle.
For a while even Larry and Barry stopped chewing on my windpipe.
Who are Larry and Barry?
My mates.
Larry and Barry.
If they don't get me, then the night fevers will.
Well, we've only got four for big boy here, so he's all but useless.
But we can squirt off this little pinky a raunchy 29 times.
Angharad used to call them antiseed.
Plant one and watch something die.
We are down 30,000 units of guzzoline, 19 canisters of nitro, 12 assault bikes,
7 pursuit vehicles.
The deficit mounts.
And now, sir, you have us stuck in a quagmire.
Organic mechanic: Hey, Joe!
Boss!
Your girly's breathing her last!
What about the child?
Are ya comin', brother?
Wait!
[Groans] It's gone awful quiet in there.
Get it out.
Come on!
I've been called to the torture!
Patience!
Oh, you stay here with your grief, daddy.
I'll fetch 'em for ya.
Be careful!
Protect the assets!
Just one angry shot...
For furiosa.
Hut!
Cryin' shame. [Chuckles]
Come.
Nother month...
Could've been your viable human.
Was it a male?
Your a-one Alpha prime.
Hey, rictus!
Huh? You lost a baby brother.
Perfect in every way.
I had a baby brother!
I had a little baby brother!
And he was perfect!
Perfect in every way!
Come on.
Wouldn't wanna shoot the wives, sir.
Just probing.
Capable: He wants to help!
Who?
! The war boy!
Where did he come from?
! The dag: I thought we threw him off the rig!
T-there's high ground just beyond that thing.
He means the tree.
Yeah. Tree!
Leave him to me.
Say, anyone notice that bright light?
Encroaching gunfire?
Get out.
I-I can do this. I know this machine.
Capable: He does. He's a revhead.
You've got two left.
On him.
[Machine gun firing] Don't breathe.
Hey! Hey!
Hey! War boy!
I'm gonna use the winch 'round the tree thing!
Take this.
Let's get the engine plates.
Max: You drive the rig!
Hold up a flare.
I am holding a flare!
Closer.
It's right in front of your eyes!
[Engine revs] Hut!
Hut!
Blood bag!
I am the scales of justice!
Conductor of the choir of death!
Sing, brother koch!
Sing, brothers, sing!
Sing!
Don't they know they're shooting at us?
[Echoing] Gun fever!
[Engine hissing] I never thought I'd do something as shine as that.
How are the engines?
Very hot and real thirsty.
Hey. You need to take the war rig half a click down the track.
What if you're not back by the time the engines have cooled?
Well, you keep moving.
What do you suppose he's gonna do?
Retaliate first.
Let's go!
Toast: Are you hurt?
You're bleeding. [Grunts] That's not his blood.
[Liquid pouring] What is this?
It's mother's milk.
It's okay.
Sleep.
Get some rest.
How do you know this place even exists?
I was born there.
So why'd you leave?
I didn't.
I was taken as a child.
Stolen.
You done this before?
Many times.
Now that I drive a war rig...
This is the best shot I'll ever have.
And them?
They're looking for hope.
What about you?
Redemption.
Hey, what's that?
I remember something like that.
Woman: Help me!
[Sobbing] Help me!
Help me, please! Uh-oh.
Please!
That's bait.
[Sobbing] Stay in the rig.
Hurry! Please, hurry! They'll be back!
I am one of the vuvalini!
Of the many mothers!
My initiate mother was k.T. Concannon!
I am the daughter of Mary jabassa.
My clan was swaddle dog!
It's me.
There's something in the eyes.
Perhaps it is jabassa's child.
This is our furiosa.
How long has it been?
7,000 days.
Plus the ones I don't remember.
Furiosa.
What happened to your mother?
She died.
On the third day.
From where did you come?
The west.
Citadel.
Beyond the mountains.
The men... Who are they?
They're reliable.
They helped us get here.
Oh. Where did you find such creatures?
So soft.
This one has all her teeth. [Laughs]
[Both laugh] I can't wait for them to see it.
See?
See what?
Home.
The green place.
But if you came from the west, you passed it.
The crows.
The creepy place with all the crows.
The soil.
We had to get out.
We had no water and...
The water was filth.
It was poisoned. It was sour.
[Echoing] And the crows came.
[Echoing] We couldn't grow anything.
Toast: [Echoing] Where are the others?
V-Gillian: [Echoing] What others?
The many mothers.
We're the only ones left.
Look.
V-melita: That's what you call a satellite.
Toast: Miss giddy told us about those.
They used to bounce messages across the earth.
Shows.
Everyone in the old world had a show.
Do you think there's still somebody out there?
Sending shows?
Who knows?
Those are the plains of silence.
Stay right where you are, little Joe.
Kind of lost its novelty out here.
You having a baby?
Warlord Jr.
Gonna be so ugly.
It could be a girl.
You kill people with that, do ya?
Killed everyone I ever met out here.
Headshots, all of 'em.
Snap. Right in the medulla.
Thought somehow you girls were above all that.
Come here.
Take a peek.
Seeds.
These are from home.
Heirlooms. The real thing.
I plant one every chance I get.
Where?
So far, nothing's took. Earth's too sour.
Ah, so many different kinds.
Trees, flowers, fruit.
Back then, everyone had their fill.
Back then, there was no need to snap anybody.
Can I talk to you?
I've talked with the others.
We're never gonna have a better chance to make it across the salt.
If we leave the rig here and load the motorcycles up with as much as we can, we can maybe ride for 160 days.
One of those bikes is yours.
Fully loaded.
You're more than welcome to come with us.
I'll...
I'll make my own way.
[Sighs] You know, hope is a mistake.
If you can't fix what's broken, you'll, uh you'll go insane.
[Girl whispering indistinctly] [Echoing] Where are you, Max?
Where are you?
Help me.
Help us. You promised to help us.
Come on, pa. Let's go.
All right.
This is your way home.
We go back?
Mm.
Back?
Yeah.
I thought you weren't insane anymore.
What are they saying?
He wants to go back from where they came.
The citadel.
And what's there to find at the citadel?
Green.
Toast: And water.
There's a ridiculous amount of clear water.
And a lot of crops.
It's got everything you need, as long as you're not afraid of heights.
Where does the water come from?
He pumps it up from deep in the earth.
Calls it aqua cola and claims it all for himself.
And because he owns it, he owns all of us.
I don't like him already.
It'll take two weeks to skirt the wall of mountains.
Max: No.
I suggest we go back the same way we came.
Through the canyon.
It's open. We know that. Right?
He brought all his war parties through.
So we take the war rig and we charge it right through the middle of them.
We can decouple the tanker at the pass.
Shut it off behind us.
Kaboom!
[Laughter] And how exactly do we take the citadel?
Assuming we're still alive by then?
If we can block the pass, it'll be easy.
All that's left are his war pups and war boys too sick to fight.
Capable: And we'll be with nux. He's a war boy.
He'll be bringing us home, bringing back what's stolen, as he's meant to.
Nux: Yeah.
It feels like hope.
V-Melissa: I like this plan.
We can start again.
Just like the old days.
Look, it'll be a hard day.
But I guarantee you that 160 days riding' that way, there's nothin' but salt.
At least that way, you know, we might be able to...
Together...
Come across some kind of redemption.
Lookout: War rig!
That's the war rig!
That's them.
Why are they going back?
Do they wish to surrender?
They are heading for the canyon.
They're going back to the citadel!
They know it's undefended!
Bullocks!
[Engines revving] Roll up!
Roll up!
Go!
What are you doing?
Praying.
To who?
Anyone that's listening.
Here we go, girls!
That's mine!
He'll try to get in front of us, spike our wheels.
Don't blow my engine.
I'm gonna nudge him.
Just a little.
You filth!
You traitored him!
Go.
Got to back off.
Engine one is gone. Two's about to blow.
Right.
Are you a black thumb?
Uh-huh. All right.
Engine one now.
You and me, fifth wheel.
We'll unhook the tanker.
One man, one bullet.
I cannot see.
Maadi!
Maadi!
I cannot see.
Hey! Harpoons and plows!
They're hauling us back!
Leave three bolts. Three.
[Gasping] Hey, you!
[Echoing] Are you okay?
[Coughs] I think she's hurt.
No! [Screams]
Girl: [Echoing] Hey. Stay with me.
Stay with me.
V-gil: Stay with me.
Hey. Are you there?
You finish that!
I'll finish her!
Valhalla!
Engine one's good.
For now.
She's hurt!
She's hurt real bad!
[Engine sputtering] You hear that?
We're gonna see two airborne v-8s.
I'm gonna need you to drive.
[Wheezing] I'll get him out of our way.
Rictus!
Take me!
Cheedo!
What are you doing?
Aah!
No!
Big boy!
Here!
Here!
No!
Remember me?
[Echoing] He's dead!
He's dead.
When you're across safe,
I'll jam the throttle and follow you.
V-melito: Come on!
Hurry!
We're nearly at the pass.
Witness me.
Rictus!
Why is she making that noise?
She's pumping air into her chest cavity.
She's collapsing her lungs one breath at a time.
I know.
I am so sorry.
[Gasps] I know.
I know.
Hold it there.
All right.
Put that on there. Press it on.
Hey. Home.
[Whispers indistinctly] Home.
N-no.
No, no, no. No, no, no, no.
She's exsanguinated.
Drained all her blood.
Hold these.
We need that. Thank you.
Needle.
Come on!
Take this.
Keep her awake.
Furiosa.
Okay, that's not retracting.
There we go.
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.
Okay. Sorry.
There you go. Okay.
There you go.
Max.
My name is Max.
That's my name.
Brake!
Reveal yourself.
He's got something.
It's immortan Joe.
Man: The immortan Joe is dead!
Man: Furiosa!
Man #2: Furiosa!
Man #3: Furiosa!
Man #4: Furiosa!
Man #5: Furiosa!
She's back.
War pup: Let's do it!
Let 'em up. Come on.
Once upon a time, there was a girl called Ella.
And she saw the world not always as it was, but as perhaps it could be, with just a little bit of magic.
My darling!
To her mother and father, she was a princess.
True, she had no title, nor crown, nor castle, but she was the ruler of her own little kingdom, whose borders were the house and meadow on the forest's edge where her people had lived for generations.
With Mr. Goose and all their animal family.
Hello, there. What do you think you're doing?
Let the little ones have their share.
We don't want you getting an upset stomach.
Gus-Gus, you're a house mouse, not a garden mouse.
Isn't he, Jacqueline?
And you mustn't eat Mr. Goose's food.
Isn't that right, Mummy?
Do you still believe that they understand you?
- Don't they, Mother?
I believe that animals listen and speak to us if we only have the ear for it.
That's how we learn to look after them.
Who looks after us?
Fairy godmothers, of course.
And do you believe in them?
I believe in everything.
Then I believe in everything, too.
Her father was a merchant who went abroad and brought tribute back from all of Ella's subject lands.
Ella!
Where are my girls, my beautiful girls?
Where are my darlings?
Ella missed him terribly when he was away.
But she knew he would always return.
- There she is!
- Papa, welcome home!
How are you?
You've grown!
Haven't you, now?
- There you go, sir.
- What was that?
This?
I found it hanging on a tree.
I think there may be something inside.
It's so pretty.
In French, that is un papillon.
You're standing on my feet.
Shall we?
Look, Mummy!
I'm dancing!
Little papillon.
All was just as it should be.
They knew themselves to be the most happy of families to live as they did and to love each other so.
When I am king dilly, dilly
You shall be queen
Lavender's green dilly, dilly
Lavender's blue
You must love me dilly, dilly
For I love you
But sorrow can come to any kingdom, no matter how happy.
And so it came to Ella's home.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you, Doctor.
This must have been very difficult for you.
Come.
Ella.
Ella, my darling.
I want to tell you a secret.
A great secret that will see you through all the trials that life can offer.
You must always remember this.
Have courage and be kind.
You have more kindness in your little finger than most people possess in their whole body.
And it has power, more than you know.
- And magic.
- Magic?
Truly.
Have courage and be kind, my darling.
Will you promise me?
I promise.
Good.
Good.
And...
I must go very soon, my love.
Please forgive me.
Of course I forgive you.
I love you.
I love you, my darling.
I love you.
Time passed, and pain turned to memory.
In her heart, Ella stayed the same.
For she remembered her promise to her mother.
Have courage, and be kind.
Father, however, was much changed.
But he hoped for better times.
"And thence home,
"and my wife and I singing, to our great content,
"and if ever there were a man happier in his fortunes,
"I know him not."
Thus ends Mr. Pepys for today.
I do love a happy ending, don't you?
They're quite my favorite sort.
As well they should be.
Ella,
I have come to the conclusion that it's time, perhaps, to begin a new chapter.
Indeed, Father?
You'll recall that some time ago, in my travels,
I made the acquaintance of Sir Francis Tremaine.
Yes.
The Master of the Mercer's Guild, is he not?
Was.
The poor man has died, alas.
His widow, an honorable woman, finds herself alone, though still in the prime of her life.
You're worried about telling me.
But you mustn't be.
Not if it will lead to your happiness.
Yes.
Happiness.
Do you think I may be allowed one last chance, even though I thought such things were done with for good?
Of course I do, Father.
She'll merely be your stepmother.
And you'll have two lovely sisters to keep you company.
Have courage, be kind.
Welcome, ladies. Welcome!
She's skinny as a broomstick!
And that stringy hair!
You're very nice.
Welcome. I'm so happy to meet you.
You have such pretty hair.
- Thank you.
- You should have it styled.
I'm sure you're right.
- Would you like a tour of the house?
- What did she say?
She wants to show us around her farmhouse.
- She's proud of it, I think.
- Do they keep animals inside?
How charming.
How perfectly charming.
Lucifer.
Her stepmother-to-be was a woman of keen feeling and refined taste.
And she, too, had known grief.
But she wore it wonderfully well.
You did not say your daughter was so beautiful.
She takes after her...
Her mother.
Just so.
What does Mummy mean?
What's so charming about it?
She's lying. That's just good manners.
Shut up.
How long has your family lived here?
Over 200 years.
And in all that time, they never thought to decorate?
Anastasia, hush.
They'll think you are in earnest.
Ella's stepmother, high-spirited lady that she was, set out to restore life and laughter to the house.
You are awful, Baron.
Fortune favors me again.
Well, look who's having a party of their own.
Jacqueline, Teddy, Matilda, greedy Gus-Gus.
Just what...
Yes, what do you think you're up to, Lucifer?
Jacqueline is my guest, and the eating of guests is not allowed.
Go on, now.
You've plenty of cat food to keep you happy.
We ladies must help one another.
You're missing the party.
I imagine it's much like all the other ones.
And I'm leaving first thing, El.
No. But you're...
You're hardly back from the last trip.
Do you have to go?
It's just a few months, my darling.
What would you like me to bring you home from abroad?
You know, your sisters...
Stepsisters, have asked for parasols and lace.
What will you have?
Bring me the first branch your shoulder brushes on your journey.
That's a curious request.
Well, you'll have to take it with you on your way and think of me when you look at it.
And when you bring it back, it means that you'll be with it.
And that's what I really want.
For you to come back.
No matter what.
I will.
Ella, while I'm away,
I want you to be good to your stepmother and stepsisters, even though they may be trying at times.
- I promise.
- Thank you.
I always leave a part of me behind, Ella.
Remember that.
And your mother's here, too, though you see her not.
She's the very heart of this place.
And that's why we must cherish this house, always, for her.
I miss her.
Do you?
Very much.
Remember the lace!
I simply must have it!
And my parasol!
For my complexion!
That means skin, if you don't know!
Bye!
Bye. Ella!
I love you!
I love you, too!
Bye!
Ella, dear.
Now, now.
Mustn't blub.
Yes, Stepmother.
You needn't call me that.
"Madam" will do.
There isn't room for me and all of your clothes!
Well, then make yourself smaller!
Anastasia and Drisella have always shared a room.
Such dear, affectionate girls.
Or...
Or better yet, disappear entirely!
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Sometimes I could scratch your eyes out!
I think they're finding the sleeping quarters rather confining.
Well, my bedroom's the biggest besides yours and Father's.
Perhaps they'd like to share it.
What a wonderful idea.
What a good girl you are.
I can stay in the...
The attic.
Quite so.
The attic?
Yes.
Only temporarily, while I have all the other rooms redecorated.
The attic's so nice and airy and you'll be away from all of our fuss and bother.
You'd be even more cozy if you kept all this bric-a-brac up there with you.
Keep you amused.
Well, no one shall disturb me here.
Hello, Gus-Gus.
Go on, Gus-Gus, you can do it.
So this is where you take refuge.
Me too, it would seem.
Right.
Who's going to help me?
Simpleton.
That is the last straw.
Our little sister, up there, talking to the woodworm.
How very pleasant.
No cats, and no stepsisters.
We have a halfwit for a sister.
I've got two.
I heard that.
- Who is she talking to?
- She's mad.
Sing, sweet nightingale
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Ella.
Good morning, Tom!
Sing sweet...
Hello. Don't mind if I...
What a lovely Chantecler. Well done.
Thanks.
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.
Thank you, Miss Ella.
You're welcome.
Ella!
Wake up, girls!
It's lunchtime!
Mornings did not agree with Ella's stepsisters.
And they lacked accomplishment in such domestic arts as keeping house.
In fact, they lacked accomplishment in any art.
It was a lover and his lass
With a hey, and a ho
And a hey nonino
That o'er the green corn-field did pass
Sweet lovers love
The spring
Sweet lovers love
The spring
Do shut up.
Ella's great comfort were the letters that Father would send from his travels.
The weeks away lengthened to months, but every day would bring his thoughts from some distant part.
Miss Ella, it's the mail coach!
Until late one afternoon...
Farmer John?
Miss Ella.
It's your father, miss.
He took ill on the road.
He's passed on, miss.
He's gone.
To the end, he spoke only of you, miss.
And your mother.
I was to give you this.
But what about my lace?
My parasol?
Can't you see?
None of that matters.
We're ruined.
How will we live?
Thank you.
It must have been very difficult for you.
How indeed to live.
Economies had to be taken.
Ella's stepmother dismissed the household.
Her stepmother and stepsisters ever misused her.
And by and by they considered Ella less a sister than a servant.
And so Ella was left to do all the work.
This was a good thing, for it distracted her from her grief.
At least that was what her stepmother said.
And she and her two daughters were more than happy to provide Ella with lots and lots of distraction.
In their defense, they did share with her the very food they ate, or rather, the scraps from their table.
She had little in the way of friends.
Well, her friends were very little.
There you are.
Have dinner with me, won't you?
But those friends she had, she treated with an open heart and an open hand.
Your table.
Sometimes, by the end of the day, the drafty attic was too cold to spend the night in, so she lay by the dying embers of the hearth to keep warm.
I thought breakfast was ready.
It is, madam.
I'm only mending the fire.
In future, can we not be called until the work is done?
As you wish.
Ella, what's that on your face?
Madam?
It's ash from the fireplace.
Do clean yourself up.
You'll get cinders in our tea.
I've got a new name for her!
Cinderwench.
I couldn't bear to look so dirty.
Dirty Ella.
Cinder-ella!
That's what we'll call you.
Girls, you're too clever.
Who's this for?
Is there someone we've forgotten?
It's my place.
It seems too much to expect you to prepare breakfast, serve it and still sit with us.
Wouldn't you prefer to eat when all the work is done, Ella?
Or should I say, "Cinderella"?
Cinderella.
Names have power, like magic spells.
And of a sudden, it seemed to her that her stepmother and stepsisters had indeed transformed her into merely a creature of ash and toil.
Run!
Quickly, my friend, or they'll catch you!
Go!
Easy!
Perhaps it was just as well that Ella's stepsisters were cruel.
For had she not run to the forest, she might never have met the prince.
Easy!
Easy!
Easy, boy!
Come on, boy, slow down!
Miss!
Miss!
Are you all right?
Hold on!
I'm all right, thank you!
That's fine.
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right,
But you've nearly frightened the life out of him.
Who?
The stag.
What's he ever done to you that you should chase him about?
I must confess I've never met him before.
He is a friend of yours?
An acquaintance.
We met just now.
I looked into his eyes, and he looked into mine, and I just felt he had a great deal left to do with his life.
That's all.
Miss, what do they call you?
Never mind what they call me.
You shouldn't be this deep in the forest alone.
I'm not alone.
I'm with you, Mister...
What do they call you?
You don't know who I am?
That is...
They call me Kit.
Well, my father does when he's in a good mood.
And where do you live, Mr. Kit?
At the palace.
My father's teaching me his trade.
You're an apprentice?
Of a sort.
That's very fine.
Do they treat you well?
Better than I deserve, most likely.
And you?
They treat me as well as they're able.
I'm sorry.
It's not your doing.
Nor yours either, I'll bet.
It's not so very bad.
Others have it worse, I'm sure.
We must simply have courage and be kind, mustn't we?
Yes.
You're right.
That's exactly how I feel.
Please don't let them hurt him.
But we're hunting, you see. It's what's done.
Just because it's what's done doesn't mean it's what should be done.
Right again.
Then, you'll leave him alone, won't you?
I will.
Thank you very much, Mr. Kit.
There you are, Your High...
It's Kit!
Kit!
Kit!
I'm Kit. I'm on my way.
Well, we'd better get a move on,
Mr. Kit.
As I said.
On my way.
I hope to see you again, miss.
And I, you.
You sound as if you're the first fellow ever to meet a pretty girl.
She wasn't a "pretty girl."
Well, she was a pretty girl, but there was so much more to her.
How much more?
You've only met her once.
How could you know anything about her?
You told me you knew right away when you met Mother.
That's different. Your mother was a princess.
You would have loved her anyway.
I would never have seen her, because it wouldn't have been appropriate.
And my father would have told me what I'm telling you and I would have listened.
- No, you wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.
- No, you wouldn't.
- I would.
- You wouldn't.
- You're right.
Well, how is he?
Your Majesty...
Never mind.
If it takes that long to work out a way to say it, I already know.
Father...
Way of all flesh, boy.
Come.
We shall be late.
And punctuality is the politeness of princes.
His Majesty, the King!
I'm sure your father spoke to you of your behavior in the forest.
Is it any business of yours, Grand Duke?
Your business is my business, Your Royal Highness.
It will not do to let the stag go free.
Just because it's what's done doesn't mean it's what should be done.
Or something like that.
Master Phineus, master of the paintbrush, patiently awaits.
Make him look marriageable, Master Phineus.
We must attract a suitable bride, even if he won't listen to a word I say.
I shall endeavor to please, Your Majesty.
But I can't work miracles.
A splendid canvas, Master Phineus.
Thank you.
As if he knows anything about art.
So, these portraits will really be sent abroad?
To induce the high and mighty to attend this ball you insist upon.
Which is a tradition. Which is beloved.
At which you will choose a bride.
Fascinating.
If I must marry, could I not wed, say, a good, honest country girl?
How many divisions will this "good, honest country girl" provide us?
How will she make the kingdom stronger?
We are a small kingdom amongst great states, Your Royal Highness.
And it's a dangerous world.
Listen, boy.
- Taking you up, Master Phineus.
- Good.
I want to see you and the kingdom safe.
All right, Father, on one condition.
Let the invitations go to everyone, not just the nobility.
The wars have brought sorrow on us all.
What do you think?
Would that please the people?
It's beyond my wit, Your Majesty.
But I wouldn't mind a bit of a jolly.
I think we might have made a bargain.
A ball for the people, and a princess for the prince.
Sounds like a step in the right direction, if you ask...
We didn't ask you.
I'm so sorry.
Naughty paint, naughty brush.
Down, please, Samson.
Haven't even got a cushion.
Right, down, down. Not that...
Oi!
I'm on the ground.
I am literally on the ground. Sorry.
Actually this is a very good angle for you.
Great nostrils. Could I have a longer brush?
You don't look well, miss.
Not at all.
Why do you stay there, when they treat you so?
Because I made my mother and father a promise to cherish the place we were so happy.
They loved our house and now that they're gone, I love it for them.
It's my home.
Hear ye!
Hear ye!
Quiet!
"Know,
"on this day, two weeks hence,
"there shall be held, at the palace,
"a Royal Ball.
"At said ball,
"in accordance with ancient custom,
"the prince shall choose a bride.
"Furthermore,
"at the behest of the prince,
"it is hereby declared that every maiden in the kingdom,
"be she noble or commoner,
"is invited to attend.
"Such is the command of our most noble king."
Excuse me, madam.
Ella was enormously excited to see Kit, the apprentice.
And her stepsisters were mildly intrigued by the notion of meeting the prince.
I shall trick him into loving me. See if I don't!
This is the most hugest news!
Calm yourselves.
Now listen to me.
One of you must win the heart of the prince.
Do that, and we can unwind the debt in which we were ensnared when we came to this backwater!
I, a princess?
Or rather, I, a princess?
Having delivered your news, why are you still here?
You must return to town right away and tell that seamstress to run us up three fine ball gowns.
Three?
That's very thoughtful of you.
What do you mean?
To think of me.
Think of you?
Mummy, she believes the other dress is for her.
Poor, slow, little Cinders. How embarrassing.
You're too ambitious for your own good.
No. I only want to see my friend.
Let me be very clear.
One gown for Anastasia, one for Drisella, and one for me!
She doesn't know what that means.
Good. Right. That's settled then.
Now go!
Every girl in the kingdom will be chasing the prince.
You must get there first before the seamstress is drowning in work!
Tell me what she said, Drisella.
I speak French, not Italian!
Wake up, Your Royal Highness. You're in a daze.
I'm sorry.
You've been off since the hunt.
It's that wonderful girl. I can't stop thinking about her.
But there are plenty of girls.
But her spirit, her goodness...
You don't suppose she has a sister, do you?
I don't know.
I don't know anything about her.
Perhaps your mystery girl may come to the ball.
That is why you threw the doors open, is it not?
Captain. It was for the benefit of the people.
Of course. How shallow of me.
And if she comes, then what?
Then you will tell her you're a prince.
And a prince may take whichever bride he wishes.
- Ha!
- Ha?
Yes, "ha."
You know my father and the Grand Duke will only have me marry a princess.
Well, if this girl from the forest is as charming as you say, they may change their minds.
The day of the ball arrived and the entire kingdom held its breath in anticipation.
You want me to be your queen?
Who?
Me?
Tighter.
Tighter!
Tighter.
That's it!
A vision, sister.
Likewise.
We must compete for the prince's hand.
But let it not mean we harbor dark thoughts against each other.
Of course not, dear sister.
I wouldn't dream of poisoning you before we leave for the ball.
Nor I of pushing you from a moving carriage on the way there.
Or I of dashing your brains out on the palace steps as we arrive.
We are sisters, after all.
And blood is so much thicker than water.
We shall let the prince decide.
What will he be like, I wonder?
What does it matter what he's like?
He's rich beyond reason.
Wouldn't you like to know a bit about him before you marry him?
Certainly not. It might change my mind.
I bet you have never ever spoken to a man.
Have you, moon-face?
I have, once.
To a gentleman.
Some menial, no doubt.
Some 'prentice.
He was an apprentice, yes.
All men are fools, that's what Mama says.
The sooner you learn that, the better.
The first dance, milady?
Prince Charming, you're so naughty!
- I want to try it.
- No, I'm wearing it.
No!
No!
Not for the first time,
Ella actually felt pity for these two schemers, who could be every bit as ugly within as they were fair without.
My prince!
He will love me!
But I will be his queen!
If her stepmother would not have a fourth dress made, it seemed to Ella that there was no reason why she would not try to run it up herself.
And besides, she did have a little help.
My dear girls.
To see you like this, it makes me believe one of you might just snare the prince.
And to think I have two horses in the race!
I daresay no one in the kingdom will outshine my daughters.
Cinderella?
It cost you nothing.
It was my mother's old dress, you see.
And I took it up myself.
Cinderella at the ball!
No one wants a servant for a bride.
After all I've done...
I don't want to ruin anything. I don't even want to meet the prince.
And you won't, because there's no question of your going.
But, all of the maidens of the land are invited, by order of the king.
It is the king I am thinking of.
It would be an insult to the royal personage to take you to the palace dressed in these old rags.
Rags?
This was my mother's.
I'm sorry to have to tell you but your mother's taste was questionable.
This thing is so old-fashioned it's practically falling to pieces.
The shoulder's frayed.
- It's falling to bits.
- And this!
It's a ridiculous, old-fashioned joke!
How could you?
How could I otherwise?
I will not have anyone associate my daughters with you.
It would ruin their prospects to be seen arriving with a ragged servant girl.
Because that is what you are.
And that is what you will always be.
Now mark my words!
You shall not go to the ball!
Go on, get going!
I'm sorry, Mother.
I'm sorry.
I said I'd have courage, but I don't.
Not anymore.
I don't believe anymore.
Excuse me.
Can you help me, miss?
Just a little crust of bread, or better, a cup of milk?
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes. I think I can find something for you.
Why are you crying?
It's nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing.
What is a bowl of milk?
Nothing.
But kindness makes it everything.
Now, I don't mean to hurry you, but you really haven't got long, Ella.
How do you know me?
Who are you?
Who am I?
I should think you'd have worked that one out.
I'm your hairy dogfather.
I mean, fairy godmother!
You can't be.
Why not?
They don't exist.
They're just made up for children.
Didn't your own mother believe in them?
Don't say no, because I heard her.
You heard her?
Fiddle-faddle, fiddle-faddle.
Right!
First things first.
Let me slip into something more comfortable.
That's better.
Now, where was I?
How did you...
Yes. Let's see.
What we need is something that sort of says, "coach."
That trough?
Doesn't really say "coach."
No, no, I'm liking fruit and veg.
Do you grow watermelons?
No.
Cantaloupe?
I don't even know what that is.
Artichoke?
Kumquat?
Beef tomato?
We do have pumpkins.
Pumpkins?
This will be a first for me.
Always interesting.
I don't usually work with squashes.
Too mushy.
Let me see. That'll do. Yes.
- There you are.
- Thank you, darling.
Hello, my strangely orange vegetable friend.
A quick snip for you.
Lovely!
Heavy pumpkin!
Look out, mices!
Well. Never mind.
Let's do it here.
Do what here?
Turn the pumpkin into a carriage.
You're making me nervous, actually.
- Shall I shut my eyes?
- It might be better.
For heaven's sake. Let's just go for it.
Well, something's definitely happening.
You see, the trick is...
Actually, I've forgotten what the trick is.
I just thought, if it...
If it does get much bigger...
Yes?
Hang on.
Is that what you meant to do?
Do you think that's what I meant to do?
Run!
Run, darling!
Take cover!
There!
One carriage.
You really are my fairy godmother.
Of course.
I don't go about transforming pumpkins for just anybody.
Now, where are those mice?
- Mice?
- Yes.
Mice, mice, mice.
There they are.
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!
Four white chargers.
Gus-Gus, how fine you look!
But how did you...
Now, where are we?
Got carriage, horses...
Footmen!
Footmen?
Hello, lovely Mr. Lizard.
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!
Hello!
You called?
Now, I need that coachman.
Coachman?
Did I say "coachman"?
I meant "goose."
I can't drive. I'm a goose.
Now, shoo!
Everyone into place, no time to be lost!
Come on!
Fairy Godmother!
Yes, what?
My dress.
I can't go in this dress.
- Can you mend it?
- Mend it?
No, no. I'll turn it into something new.
No, please don't.
This was my mother's.
And I'd like to wear it when I go to the palace.
It's almost like taking her with me.
I understand.
But she wouldn't mind if I gee it up a bit?
Wouldn't mind a nice blue?
No.
There.
It's beautiful.
She'd love it.
Now, come on. Off you go. Quick!
You'll be late!
I'm very new at this!
Oh, boy.
Stop that blooming coach!
Thank you.
Just a moment!
Are those the best you have?
It's all right. No one will see them.
No, they'll ruin the whole look. Quick, quick.
Take them off. Really quite hideous.
Let's have something new for a change.
I'm rather good at shoes.
But...
They're made of glass?
Yes.
And you'll find they're really comfortable.
Ella, you really must go now.
Fairy Godmother?
What is it?
My stepmother and the girls?
Don't worry.
I'll make sure they don't recognize you.
Now, off you go.
For you shall go to the ball.
In you get. So lovely.
Do stop wittering on.
Ella!
I almost forgot.
Remember, the magic will only last so long.
With the last echo of the last bell, at the last stroke of midnight, the spell will be broken and all will return to what it was before.
Midnight?
Midnight.
That's more than enough time.
- Off you go then.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Goosey, go!
Good bye!
Chandeliers, aloft!
Princess Mei Mei of Fujian.
Princess Shahrzad of the Seljuqs.
Your Highness!
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa!
Princess Imani of Shona!
Princess Hiina of the Chrysanthemum Throne!
Lady Tremaine and her daughters.
The Lady Tremaine and her daughters.
I'm Drisella.
And I'm Anastasia.
- People will want to know.
- I'm the clever one.
I'm very beautiful.
The very clever Miss Drisella, and the very beautiful Anastasia.
Do come on!
The Lord Veneering.
Who are you looking for?
No one.
It's that girl in the forest, isn't it?
That's why you were so generous with the invitations.
Father, it was for the people.
I know you love the people, Kit.
But I also know that your head's been turned.
But you've only met her once, in the forest.
And you would have me marry someone I met once, tonight.
A princess.
It's a princess or nothing.
Hold the doors!
One more coming in.
May I present Her Royal Highness, the Princess Chelina of Zaragosa.
You are as handsome as your picture.
And your little kingdom is enchanting.
I hope the princess will not find our "little kingdom" too confining.
Miss Ella.
Thank you.
I'm frightened, Mr. Lizard.
I'm only a girl, not a princess.
And I'm only a lizard, not a footman.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness,
My Lords, ladies and gentlemen, distinguished visitors and people of our land, the prince shall now choose his partner for the first dance.
Let our ball commence!
Excuse me.
A thousand apologies, Your Royal Highness.
I don't know what happened.
Mr. Kit.
It's you, isn't it?
Just so.
Your Highness...
If I may, that is,
it would give me the greatest pleasure, if you would do me the honor of letting me lead you through this... the first...
Dance?
Yes, dance.
That's it.
They're all looking at you.
Believe me, they're all looking at you.
Who is she?
I have no idea.
Who's that, Mama?
I'm not exactly sure, but this does not bode well.
That's a lovely dress she's got on.
- And how pretty she is.
- Concentrate!
You must turn the prince's head, you fools!
Now, get out there!
But no one's asked us to dance.
Gentlemen.
May I present my daughters,
- Anastasia, Drisella.
- Mademoiselle.
Off you go!
Smile.
Come with me.
Over there. Smile.
So, you're the prince!
Not "the prince," exactly.
There are plenty of princes in the world. I'm only a prince.
But your name's not really Kit.
Certainly it is, and my father still calls me that, when he's especially un-peeved at me.
But you're no apprentice.
I am. An apprentice monarch.
Still learning my trade.
Oh, gosh!
Look, please forgive me.
I thought you might treat me differently if you knew.
I mistook you for a good, honest country girl, and now I see you didn't want to overawe a plain soldier.
Little chance of that.
No more surprises?
No more surprises.
Is that you?
I hate myself in paintings. Don't you?
No one's ever painted my portrait.
No?
Well, they should.
Who is she?
She gave no name, Your Grace.
You didn't ask?
I was out of breath, Your Grace, on account of introducing
Princess Blodwyn of Llanfairpwllgwyngyll...
- Shut up, will you?
- "Shut up." Absolutely.
I don't believe this!
No!
Not her!
Won't they miss you at the ball?
Maybe.
But let's not go back just yet.
What's wrong?
When I go back, they will try to pair me off with a lady of their choosing.
I'm expected to marry for advantage.
Well, whose advantage?
That is a good question.
Well, surely you have a right to your own heart.
And I must weigh that against the king's wishes.
He's a wise ruler and a loving father.
Well, perhaps he'll change his mind.
I fear he hasn't much time to do so.
Poor Kit.
People are saying she's a princess.
Our prince seems quite taken with her.
She went straight for him.
You have to appreciate her efficiency.
But surely, if she is a princess, this may be good.
I've already promised him in marriage, to the Princess Chelina.
But...
Forgive me, Your Grace.
I did not mean to intrude.
No, it's you who have to forgive me, madam.
Your secret is safe with me.
I've never shown this place to anyone.
A secret garden.
I love it!
Please.
No, I shouldn't.
You should.
- I shouldn't.
- You should.
I will.
May I?
Please.
It's made of glass.
And why not?
Allow me.
Thank you.
There.
There.
Won't you tell me who you really are?
If I do, I think everything might be different.
I don't understand. Can you at least tell me your name?
My name is...
I have to leave.
It's hard to explain.
Lizards and pumpkins, and things.
Wait!
Where are you going?
You've been awfully nice.
Thank you for a wonderful evening.
I've loved it.
Every second!
"Lizards and pumpkins."
Excuse me.
Sorry!
Terribly sorry.
My goodness!
My prince!
You've got the wrong one!
He needs her name!
I know he needs her name.
Her name, you ninny. Get her name!
That really hurt!
Your Majesty.
Young lady.
I am so sorry.
Think nothing of it, my dear.
I wanted to say, Your Majesty, your son Kit is the most lovely person I ever met.
So good and brave.
I hope you know how much he loves you.
Excuse me!
Wait!
Wait!
Where are you going?
Hurry, hurry!
Come back!
Hurry!
Hurry, please, Mr. Goose!
Wait!
Watch out!
Captain, my horse.
No!
This may be some intrigue to lure you from the palace.
Your father needs you here.
Captain!
I was having a fine old time.
You had to go and choose that one, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Hurry, Mr. Goose!
Come on!
Hee-ya!
Be careful, Mr. Goose!
Oh, my goodness!
You there!
Stop in the name of the king!
Such bad timing.
Halt there!
I know what to do!
Yes!
Get this thing open!
Oh, dear!
No, no, no.
I'm sorry.
You'll find it's very comfortable.
Do shut up!
Cinderella!
Cinderella!
We'll have to wake her up.
Cinderella!
Wake up, lazy bones!
Tea and a plate of biscuits.
Welcome back!
- You look cheerful!
- And wet!
I took a walk in the rain to cheer myself up.
Typical.
Tea.
We did not communicate through mere words.
Our souls met.
Precisely. My soul and the prince's soul.
Your soul was over by the banquet tables.
You didn't see him dance with me.
Dance with you?
He didn't even speak to you.
It was not our fault, Mother.
It was that girl.
The mystery princess.
My, what a charming notion.
She was no princess.
She was a preening interloper who made a spectacle of herself.
A vulgar, young hussy marched into the ball, unaccompanied, if you will, and to the horror of everyone, threw herself at the prince.
And he actually danced with the ugly thing.
- Yes?
- Yes.
It was pity.
He was too polite to send her packing in front of everyone, you see.
- he took her apart.
- And told her off.
But she refused to leave and the palace guards chased her from the party!
I pity the prince. Such bad taste.
They belong with each other.
Well, it's no matter, girls.
The ball was a mere diversion.
The prince is not free to marry for love.
He's promised to the Princess Chelina of Zaragosa.
The Grand Duke told me himself.
It's so very unfair.
Yes.
The way of the world.
Hello again.
Thank you for your help.
It really was like a dream.
Better than a dream.
Ella couldn't wait to write down all that had happened, so that she might remember every single bit of it just as if she were telling her mother and father about the palace ball and her time with the prince.
Above all, the prince.
You've come.
Good.
Father.
Don't go.
I must.
You needn't be alone.
Take a bride.
The Princess Chelina.
What if I commanded you to do so?
I love and respect you, but I will not.
I believe that we need not look outside of our borders for strength or guidance.
What we need is right before us.
And we need only have courage and be kind to see it.
Just so.
You've become your own man.
Good.
And perhaps, in the little time left to me,
I can become the father you deserve.
You must not marry for advantage.
You must marry for love.
Find that girl.
Find her.
The one they're all talking about.
The forgetful one
- who loses her shoes.
- ...
loses her shoes.
Be cheerful, boy.
Thank you, Father.
Thank you, Kit.
I love you, son.
I love you, Father.
Once the time for mourning had passed, a proclamation was sent out.
Hear ye!
Hear ye!
Hear ye!
Know that our new king hereby declares his love for
the mysterious princess as wore glass slippers to the ball.
And requests that she present herself at the palace, whereupon, if she be willing, he will forthwith marry her
with all due ceremony.
Are you looking for this?
There must be quite a story to go with it.
Won't you tell me?
No?
All right then.
I shall tell you a story.
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful young girl who married for love.
And she had two loving daughters.
All was well.
But, one day, her husband, the light of her life, died.
The next time, she married for the sake of her daughters.
But that man, too, was taken from her.
And she was doomed to look every day upon his beloved child.
She had hoped to marry off one of her beautiful, stupid daughters to the prince.
But his head was turned by a girl with glass slippers.
And so,
I lived unhappily ever after.
My story would appear to be ended.
Now, tell me yours.
Did you steal it?
No.
It was given to me.
Given to you?
Given to you. Nothing is ever given.
For everything, we must pay and pay.
That's not true.
Kindness is free. Love is free.
Love is not free.
Now, here is how you will pay me, if you are to have what you desire.
No one will believe you, a dirty servant girl without a family, if you lay claim to the prince's heart.
But with a respectable gentlewoman to put you forward, you will not be ignored.
When you are married, you will make me the head of the royal household.
Anastasia and Drisella we will pair off with wealthy lords.
And I shall manage that boy.
But he's not a boy.
And who are you?
How would you rule a kingdom?
Best to leave it to me.
That way we all get what we want.
No.
I was not able to protect my father from you, but I will protect the prince and the kingdom, no matter what becomes of me.
Well, that is a mistake.
No!
Why?
Why are you so cruel?
I don't understand it.
I've tried to be kind to you.
You?
Kind to me?
Yes.
And though no one deserves to be treated as you have treated me.
Why do you do it?
Why?
Because you are young, and innocent, and good.
And I...
No!
May I ask where you got this?
From a ragged servant girl in my household.
The mystery princess is a commoner.
You could imagine when I discovered her subterfuge how horrified I was.
You told no one else?
Not even my own daughters.
No one need ever know the truth.
You've spared the kingdom a great deal of embarrassment.
And I should like to keep it that way.
Are you threatening me?
Yes.
So what do you want?
I should like to be a countess.
And I require advantageous marriages for my two daughters.
Done.
And the girl?
Do with her what you will.
She's nothing to me.
- Where?
- Abandoned on the side of the road.
- And have you found her?
- The girl?
No, she's disappeared.
There must be some reason she vanished.
Perhaps she has been prevented from speaking.
Do not lose heart, Kit.
On the contrary, lose heart and gain wisdom.
The people need to know that the kingdom is secure.
That the king has a queen, and the land may have an heir.
They want to face the future with certainty!
Agreed!
Then let us be certain.
I am king.
I say we shall seek out the mystery princess, even if she does not want to be found.
I have to see her again.
But if she's not found, then for the good of the kingdom, you must marry the Princess Chelina.
For the good of the kingdom.
Very well, agreed.
But Your Highness...
But you will spare no effort.
Your Majesty, of course. You have my word.
Next.
The slipper traveled the length and breadth of the kingdom, visiting every maiden both high and low, and every sort in between.
Oh, Lord!
You first, madam.
Well, I'll give it a go.
Right. I say. Where do you want me?
Up!
Up I go.
Careful, my foot's a bit swollen. I've been...
It's the yeast.
The Grand Duke was true to his word.
He spared no effort to demonstrate to the prince that the mystery princess was not to be found.
It fits!
- It doesn't fit you.
- It does fit!
- It doesn't fit.
- It's mine!
- I am the mystery princess!
- Give back the shoe.
Take the shoe away from her!
Don't take the shoe away from me, please, please!
Please, it's my shoe!
Make way for the slipper!
Can I try the other foot?
I don't think so.
But whatever they tried, the magical slipper refused to fit even the most eligible of maidens.
We found the mystery princess for ya!
What's wrong, Captain?
We haven't found the girl.
I'm disappointed for our king.
Come on, now!
Don't lose heart.
There's one more house.
We must leave no stone unturned.
- Horses!
- Horses!
Mother, it's our chance!
Let them in!
Gentlemen!
What a wonderful surprise.
A moment of your time, good lady.
Of course, Your Grace.
Please. This way.
Ella did not know who was downstairs.
Nor did she care.
For surely no one had come to see her.
Jacqueline, stop it!
It shrunk.
Try again.
Enough!
You must love me...
Though Ella was sad, her spirit was not broken.
She knew that the ball, and her time with the prince, would become beautiful, distant memories, like those of her father and mother, and her golden childhood.
It fits me!
Bad luck, miss.
Lavender's green dilly, dilly
Lavender's blue
You must love me dilly, dilly
For I love you
Very well.
Our task is done, Captain.
But fate may yet be kind to us, girls.
Indeed, madam!
When I am king dilly, dilly
You shall be queen
Lavender's green dilly, dilly
Lavender's blue
If you love me Dilly, dilly
I will love you
Let the birds sing dilly, dilly
And the lambs play
We shall be safe dilly, dilly...
Do you hear that, Your Grace?
Let's be off, Captain.
Just a moment.
Madam, there is no other maiden in your house?
None.
Then has your cat learned to sing?
There's been enough play-acting today, Captain. Let's be off.
But she's lying, Your Grace.
Nonsense!
I trust the lady. We're leaving.
Grand Duke!
Your Majesty.
What sweet singing.
Makes me want to tarry just a little.
Your Majesty, I did not know...
Captain, would you be so kind as to investigate?
It would be my pleasure, Your Majesty.
If you love me dilly, dilly
I will love you
There!
You see?
I told you it was no one of any importance.
We'll see about that.
Miss.
You are requested and required to present yourself to your king.
I forbid you to do this!
And I forbid you to forbid her!
Who are you to stop an officer of the king?
Are you an empress?
A saint?
A deity?
I am her mother.
You have never been and you never will be my mother.
Come now, miss.
Just remember who you are, you wretch!
Would who she was, who she really was, be enough?
There was no magic to help her this time.
This is perhaps the greatest risk that any of us will take.
To be seen as we truly are.
Have courage, and be kind.
Who are you?
I am Cinderella.
Your Majesty,
I'm no princess.
I have no carriage, no parents, and no dowry.
I do not even know if that beautiful slipper will fit.
But if it does,
will you take me as I am?
An honest country girl who loves you.
Of course I will.
But only if you will take me as I am.
An apprentice still learning his trade.
Please.
Cinderella!
Ella!
My dear sister!
I'm sorry.
So very sorry.
Shall we?
I forgive you.
Forgiven or not,
Cinderella's stepmother and her daughters would soon leave with the Grand Duke, and never set foot in the kingdom again.
They would have loved each other.
We must have a portrait of you painted.
No. I do hate myself in paintings.
Be kind.
And have courage.
And all will be well.
Are you ready?
For anything, so long as it's with you.
My queen.
My Kit.
And so Kit and Ella were married, and I can tell you, as her fairy godmother, that they were counted to be
The fairest and kindest rulers the kingdom had known.
And Ella continued to see the world not as it is, but as it could be, if only you believe in courage and kindness and occasionally, just a little bit of magic.

Spirit of the Supreme Court...
I have committed many crimes have caused many victims perished.

Mau save him!

The ring on his hand looks of a queen.
While dying, her hand only to the top of the cliff.

These people are?
The mother had killed two people.
They are probably down and kill her.
Chief!
There is a cave here. Do not know what it is anymore.
How do they get into this cave they there?
Baby's mother was only the top of the cliff...
It comes from that?
I think that is wrong.
These people want to kill the child...

- But where should.
Now it is a son you.
A mother without children like you... was divine entrusted by this river.
Okay. If anyone objects to this...
They will be exorbitant die.

Rascall! There are monsters there.
If you go there, you will be eaten.

How many times Mom has told is not climbing it.
Why do try to climb it, dear?
Do not come it again then, son?
This time seems to climb higher before.

Well, 100 times.
S cold ground.

Bathing in water extraction 1000... requests would be implemented.
Swami, I'm done, I applied it to his son okay?
My son will stop climbing right?
No, she thought Shiva is what?
She must always remind him... then it will have to follow the women.
Yes, Swami. I will do that.
Mother, the parent star's children think?
She kept walking up and down the world do?
- Get out.
- Mother hear me say first.
Did you hear mother say?
Father said to her mother know.
- Sanga.
- What?
For it is fine, let it know that know here.
- Let go of the mother.
- Mother.
Then you'll go instead of her.
- Really?
- Can not.
Shiva unacceptable.
To bridge the divine must perform several conditions.
Swami.
He considered it.
- Mother, mother...
- I going to do?
Since forbidden so I can only carrying his mother to fetch water for the spirits alone, okay?
No, Shiva is not acceptable.
Those who wish will be fulfilled self-responsibility.
But the mother and daughter seemed happy.
Swami.
He and Shiva would kill my mother died.
How I learned, all because love for Shiva alone.
Sanga...
Come and see her son do this.
What has he done wrong?
Shiva.

He was told to take another kick.
I do not see any rocks.
No, she thought Shiva is what?
However...
Where to see it?
While he said the mask fell from a cliff.
So why?
How do I...
I offered offerings for Lord Shiva?
Shiva must be heard.
Swami, I feel anxiety something.
The rock must be taken from four mountain .
Otherwise Shiva will not satisfy our prayers, Swami.
You do not say that!
I did it because my son alone.
To request be made after all.
Right, Swami?
Shiva think... will be performed.
I did say that.
Shivudu...
How many days he found a new employer mask?
I will go to the farm.
As much time, I will speak with his mother there.
- Come on, go home.
- Scat. I later.
Come on.
Who are you?
Why come to us?
Vaishali.
- Where are you from?
- Let's go.
We have a huge opportunity to achieve their goals.
On the day of the previous... ceremonial birthday Bhallaladeva King, everyone in the kingdom would partying.
Actually... who bear the image of the divine?
It's time to Avanthika led then.
What, Avanthika?
Why like this?
Focus head on, just the determination, she can look to that.
She was assigned responsibility lot and many people depend on her.
She must complete them.
The implementation of this plan was due tears, not fear.
These are not voluntary.
My body was burning devil and create flames.
Utterly shameful if it were injured.
Give me a roadmap.
She will hit the road for two days.
You should be careful on the road, Avanthika.
Calculation so do not get caught.
For umpteen Bijjaladeva to torture and kill her.
Majesty, losing to the Buffalo two days new arrival.
The buffalo still untamed, should ask him to be careful.
He ministers.
Bhallaladeva not only the strength of a man... which is of 10 buffalo there.
The hand kept going.
Defeat it!
Ministers and he was killing it then.
The buffalo were killed, just as majestic.
It's amazing to disbelief, Katappa.
I know there are those who want to kill me, you think try.
But life is still in our hands.
Why is the Katappa?
You can do it?
Well.
You want to apply for credentials.
No matter what happens.
Majesty.
Spirit have one request.
The mother was under sentence of 25 years.
Please release her.
I promise you.
Come on.
Spirit allows her freedom suicide.
Freedom is better than death. Go, Katappa.
Go.
Do not want it?
So I let her suffer.
I want her to hear me suffer to die.
Stand up!
There is no lack of abuse?
He said he wanted it.
Where is He?
Saying I know go.
I just ask you one thing only.
That day he was gone. Go somewhere. You heard his name yet?
At midnight, ye endure torture.
You may also want to live? English chain tinkling... fun ear not hear?
None.
Mahishmati Devasena forget.
His name is not only mentioned once but also referred to the long-term
until this country consider him... just me and you.
Spectacular as death stood before thee.
Again, I think we have to kill him .
Both happened not nice.
Maharani Devasena...
This time, have the right to know.
He said...
Shackles ready to be removed.
She spent some time there during the star?
No, Katappa.
My son has come.
I will be saved.
But the boy died before that.
Son was alive.
I have come to this.
Do not look to the child.
Why are you still believe in that?
She did not need to take this punishment where .
There will be no other opportunity like this anymore .
Everything to the right person at the right time.
She accept to go.
Accept go.
I asked her not to waste time anymore.
She collects firewood it?
I think only new Katappa not stop me.
Flames looking for shelter.
Blood-stained body Bhallaladeva... since tried to extinguish the fire in the room.
Of course my son will come.
The fire on Bhallaladeva bed.
Beast kill nobody. Fear death...
Sounds of Bhallaladeva...
The stone sculpture of the royal Mahishmati .
My son has come.
What is this place, Avanthika?
We slept here for hands floated.
If it is still here, maybe he'll stay up.
Avanthika.
On her shoulder is the What?
Avanthi.
Go away, I followed.
Have not seen those shoulders?
Beautiful is not it?
The back side of this mo never laugh about?
Narrowly it.
Hey, archers surprise.
Want to kill him?
What are you?
Finally asked. I am Shivudu...
Ambhala Village.
I'm climbing to the view from the top.
That is what I wanted to hear.
Now my turn to catch the perpetrator.
Avanthika.
Tell him not to go.
- I mean it. I'm climbing that.
- To stop.
He said only Shiva can bestow it.
I was one of them.
Tell me go.
Things will automatically show up.
I would tell her everything.
But before that,
- I want to ask one thing.
- Who to ask?
Who is she?
She.... am?
Sword in hand, wearing armor, eyes aggressive... angry face.
I did not request this.
Also, she should be eased.
Who is she?
I say she OK?
She is a girl.
I was a kid.
I came to love.
Pain...
This is my ....
I do lose it at the lake in the mountains.
English...
I came here just to climb.
Really far.
To see the smile on his face mask employer.
But not him.
Few people in history to say so.
120 gold statue.
- Impossible. - Really.
Thursday will honor... us... everywhere.
Worldwide.
The preparation OK?
King has prepared everything.
Tomorrow will clean the statue.
One day outside... sky will shake.
What, Avanthika?
See stars go.
Catch him.
.... Three....
Three...
Hu Li....!
(Savior)
Majesty, god abandoned.
Spirit does not know anything, god guilty.
Majesty please pardon the gods.
Sorry, Shivudu.
I do not think of what else to do.
It's good that I can not go because he could not dispel my determination.
His Avanthika.
I do not mind it.
Please hand over his responsibilities to his children.
I do not know who it is,
But if they want to rescue the man,
I'll help you.
English swear.
Mahishmati dynasty. My son has come.
Baahubali back.
Silent, no nothing.
Because to 100 feet high statue, at least 100 workers would have been killed.
Baahubali.
Baahubali.
Baahubali.
Who?
Baahubali.
Baahubali.
Baahubali are?
Baahubali.
Statue was erected already.
Threatened people fear things they were afraid available in the first place?
I have seen when he went to go?
There must be some way.
Let's start out one witness.
Let me ask who he is, where he and his wanted.
What are you doing here?
- Ta... - To meet the King go.
Today is the first one coral Baahubali name wrong?
I'm asking you that.
Why are you silent?
If cut, the blade can still nod instead!
We do not know God.
Shut up!
No one yet direct soldiers to see him back?
Shen see, sir Majesty.
His eyes... shape as we have seen elsewhere.
Bhadra.
Getting his life.
Come on.
Who are you?
He's here, catch him again.
Calling all soldiers back here!
Katappa, dynasty was ruined already.
King was cremated.
- These people go out frontier. - Yes.
I want to catch him alive.
- Broken arm broken leg okay. - Everything else.
- Getting his life.
Come on.
Troops ready, shoot.
He was trying to escape.
The dog midnight.
Punished starved and tortured for so long that unsatisfied stars?
You saw your child ran away and tried to escape then.
Save me, he's about to kill me, Katappa.
Majesty.
Salvation is the mission.
If you want him, god will do.
Devasena...
Devasena to attack, they were attacked.
- Shivudu...
- Sanga.
Shita... teachers.
....
Three.... three....
Hu Li....
Those nestles were rescued... very confident in the appearance of these valiant of us.
We owe her a lot.
I have seen my mother's eyes... looks very sad.
What is my expression for normal every hours looking at me as a god.
I do not know the words of his mother... see the wounded...
Angry stare like a volcano outbreak.
Why?
I am?
I hope Baahubali will think of our dreams.
It was him.
Devasena During the past 25 years has sought to arrest him and tracking him.
Born as a gift for the king Shivagami...
One of them.
Mahendra. He needs to learn century history there.
Throne in Mahishmati...
His father he was eligible.
Bijjaladeva king.... refused status as a fallacy.
He thought for their own shortcomings which they have been awarded position.... so he is very angry.
Desire Mahishmati balance peaked... when his wife was pregnant 6 months.
One day the leader of the kingdom suddenly died suddenly.
One day he saw anger against Mahishmati and the absence of the king...
Shivagami.
Parliament expulsion decision simple as that anger.
As in Mahishmati ruse would be a lot to lose followers.
After the death of King... heir born.
The queen gave birth to a son.
One day later...
Maharani suffer of.
Maharani she can not save lives.
A lovely boy.
Baahubali.
Do as expressed on the throne?
I have removed anything sit on this throne in Mahishmati.
By now Mahishmati think... his intentions are serious.
Dung Sultan's officers, do not see any signs of opposition in Mahishmati.
The government has assigned a member prepared on site and the Prime Minister.
Shivagami...
Fortunately, people trust at royalty.
Please stand with us.
One girl returned behold, Shivagami dear.
Katappa !
People flock to because won kingship contentions in Mahishmati.
Rinse with blood.
He did not see you as one of those who were dead?
Go!
I, Bijjaladeva, ordered you to kill Shivagami go!
Kill Katappa go!
The protection of our will. Now we will kill you.
This is your ruse.
I do not need to finesse.
The monarch is tragic enough.
Queen, gods witnessed the heroism of people.
Proponents must restrain themselves when the throne.
No, Prime Minister.
I am not the leader.
- Then who?
- The question is not necessary, the Prime Minister.
Location Bhallaladeva, god son disqualified or what?
Speak, Shivagami.
You do have the right to receive this position.
We will struggle, allowing them to become the savior... can attract the public, it will become king of Mahishmati.
This is my law, and everything all obey.
Majesty.
Why stand up about?
Sit down.
- I eat here.
- Raja.
He should not be here.
We sit is committing a big mistake and .
I was hungry, I was going to have swallowed a lot of limitations and laws.
Him coming into the king's palace.
Eat first.
Do you know what's wrong with it?
He was monarch.
We are ordinary people.
Okay, I, king of Mahishmati decided... eat.
Excellence.
Bhalla, Bhalla. He is still my good friend, if the latter have a king.
Learn about heroism and tests... of his children, both have scored the same number of points .
Decision was made to determine the King...
I have checked their children.
Both have the same talent.
Talent necessary to check again.
Prime Minister.
Test after right more seriously.
The country must immediately determine who makes the king...
Mahishmati this time seems to stabilize.
Queen, have leaked information that the military want to create contrast.
Prince to send this message.
The two princes are looking for traitors.
Counterproductive escaped Mahishmati beyond borders...
We have found a counter-attackers hide in the Sangapura .
Sangapura, royal cavalry.
Valiant appear in the other side of the border... not step out of our center.
I have never met him before.
- Who are you? - I am here for the first time.
Why did you hide for that?
As spy it?
We should be cautious.
Do not go too far, too many guards.
Search or ingenuity?
Fact that something is exclusive.
Wine.
Less away.
Less away.
Is there any money?
Brother, I have very much money.
Not only many, but a lot.
Rather than being tortured or hanged.
Bhalala!
Sending confidential information.
Say.
King Kalakeya.
King Kalakeya unmatched design
Attacking the city...
Rural and children.
I have found a nice way.
Daughter and parents...
I will not interfere.
But they will kill people.
Much more, many people were killed or that's all.
King Kalakeya whether small countries king but fearless.
We have 25,000 soldiers.
Why should I fear you?
- How many soldiers Kalakeya in the city?
- A few thousand.
FCINE.NET HD video sharing site
What is our strategy?
"Dual Defense."
He's nothing.
He can maintain tactics of this war?
No one knows.
Kalakeya unknown soldiers.
So we must act.
I will lead.
I will confirm that.
Come to our country.
This is the only way.
Katappa, enemy stormed not that gate.
You want how many soldiers? 5,000 troops.
The recruitment for later.
It is important to set up a defensive wall iron.
Go back to talk about it.
I'm up north.
I will guarantee the right side.
According to information we received, later will be in charge Kalakeya faction leader killed.
Their structure...
We must place the stone mausoleum...
There will be many more dead soldiers... number of military mothers can stop in 10 minutes.
But to kill the leader Kalakeya. Therefore will need to change the leader.
He soon fled.
During question hour... every leader... seems to kill the leader Kalakeya thanks to the support of the cavalry.
We understand structure.
When attacked... would take at least two days.
Mom, this to the arrangements.
At the time, I'll take his head when he was separated.
Unbelievable.
Plan was finalized.
Death for a warrior chieftain Kalakeya... to be compromised his position.
Seems need a warrior elite.
Yes.
One way to prepare for the Sultan future.
Bhalala. Bahu. This is a good opportunity for the children serving the nation, you've got time.
Atone Now go!
Mahishmati Viva!
His father was a great leader beloved .
Only protected the kingdom's strict new guarantee.
They thus formed.
Bhallaladeva sent whole bow and arrow before.
Ammunition he should refuse.
Supply and small name...
The King gave one of us...
- Baahubali have a great tip.
- What is this strategy?
I needed troops and arsenals filled...
Do not know what to ask for anyone.
War will break out tomorrow it?
There were more courageous and valiant.
This is not a ruse. National legal .
Hey, somebody?
Majesty pardon. Spirit came to take the tent behest Prince.
Baahubali come.
This ritual must be performed from ancient times already.
The hero will not die in as victims.
Sir, please proceed before they become victims of war.
Goddess Kali will bring to our guns.
Why should sacrifice an innocent animal use?
This makes my blood boil.
Mahishmati Viva!
Mahishmati Viva!
Mahishmati patience has its limits.
Last time we had a chance for the people.
Dispose weapons and go from here.
One of you and your sons will die.
Did not you have declared that?
Sometimes they die in my arms.
We will attack the king of people with everything I have.
The people gave a child, turn it into king.
He must live.
Balls moving sun.
Creating such bruises... help him survive.
Setting traps with eagle eyes.
Hover eat his body.
He must be alive.
Katappa.
Featured war drums up.
Majesty.
Soldiers!
Barriers our defense was wrecked.
Ngờ wavering in the defense of the enemy Mahishmati first time.
Death is the end.
This is death.
Death.
Death.
Death.
Death.
Everyone!
Death.
Death for enemies still more lofty thought.
I would rather die than live humiliated honor.
Worse and anger from the words of a mother...
Stepped on his head on the floor not show him how to die.
His death will help us win.
Our mother, our mother earth...
I can not touch the other things... certain I realize a peaceful country.
Who wants to fight with me?
I!
Who wants to die with me?
I!
Who wants to live with me and be saved from death?

I did kill King Kalakeya.
Bhallaladeva, it is the winner!
Bhallaladeva Viva!
Bhallaladeva Viva!
Now Mahishmati already qualified, the leader of a hero.
Additionally, brave hero must be recorded on gold.
Historically everyone who has devoted should be noted.
Despite the past 3,000 years,
Heroism will be met. Today my son is a hero.
Baahubali, now the leader of a replacement new.
Shivagami, decide what is?
Son, we got King Kalakeya kill us child, my son, she did not see?
Please respect it began to reign.
Do it.
How many opponents do not want to be king?
The people we have thanks how much you tolerate.
Kill the enemy on the battlefield only stopped a glance.
However, the present battle is to kill opponents Baahubali...
Other lands are the people we help.
It is described as the transition personality.
100 heroic death...
The goal is not to kill innocent as divine protection.
- He is the savior of these people back?
- I hereby declare Baahubali will be king.
This is my decision, it is a decisive difference.
Baahubali...
Baahubali Viva!
Baahubali Viva!
Our elders also encourage its explore the vast natural.
I want to see it once.
Not a chance.
The hero was dead.

She can handle two more.
How big is the island?
Big.
But how many pounds?

Welcome to Jurassic World.
While year over year, revenue continues to climb... operating costs are higher than ever.
Our shareholders have been patient but let's be honest... no one is impressed by a dinosaur anymore.
20 years ago, de-extinction was right up there with magic.
These days, kids look at a Stegosaurus like an elephant from the city zoo.
That doesn't mean asset development is falling behind.
Our DNA excavators discover new species every year.
But consumers want them bigger, louder, more teeth.
The good news?
Our advances in gene splicing have opened up a whole new frontier.
We've learned more from genetics in the past decade... than a century of digging up bones.
So... when you say you want to sponsor an attraction... what do you have in mind?
We want to be thrilled.
Don't we all?
The Indominus Rex.
Our first genetically modified hybrid.
How did you get two different kinds of dinosaurs to, you know...
Oh, Indominus wasn't bred.
She was designed.
She will be 50 feet long when fully grown.
Bigger than the T. Rex.
Every time we've unveiled a new asset, attendance has spiked.
Global news coverage... celebrity visitors.
Eyes of the world.
When will she be ready?
She already is.
Come on!
Relax.
Come on.
Dude, chill.

Cytosine, guanine, adenine and thymine.
The same four things in everything that ever lived.
Hey, don't wander off, all right?
Mom's not paying me for babysitting.
Gray, is that you?
Aunt Claire!
Okay, yeah. No, I'm gonna have to go.
My nephews are here.
Hi.
Oh, my gosh, you're so sweet.
Whoa, Zach.
Last time I saw you, you were like...
That must've been what?
- Three, four years ago?
- Seven.
Seven years, but, you know, close.
I see you already got your wristbands.
And this is for food.
And Zara here is going to take great care of you... until I'm done working tonight, okay?
You're not coming with us?
I really wish that I could, but... tomorrow I can take you into the control room... show you behind the scenes and all of that.
That's gonna be cool, right?
Okay, so I will see you tonight at... 6:00. No, no, no.
Don't forget you have the...
Right, of course. I will see you tonight at 8:00.
What time do you go to sleep?
Or do you go to sleep at different times?
Okay, so, have fun... and take very good care of them, okay?
Yeah. No, I'm here.
It's those two juvenile Triceratops. They're going at it again.
Should I tranq them, or are you coming over to take care of this?
- Go ahead and tranq them.
- They're running.
- What's the live count?
- 22,216.
- Any incidents?
- Yes.
Six kids in the Lost and Found... 28 down with heatstroke...
Where did you get that? Oh, this?
I got it on eBay.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
I got it for $150 but the mint condition one goes for $300...
Didn't occur to you maybe that's in poor taste?
The shirt?
Yeah, no, it did.
It was terrible... but that first park was legit.
I have a lot of respect for it.
They didn't need these genetic hybrids.
They just needed dinosaurs, real dinosaurs.
Okay, please don't wear it again.
Yeah, I wasn't gonna.
- Did you close the deal?
- Looks like it.
Verizon Wireless presents the Indominus Rex.
That is so terrible.
Why not just go the distance, and just let these corporations name the dinosaurs?
They've got all the ballparks.
- Why stop there?
- Why are the West Plains closed?
Another Pachy roaming outside his zone.
But he's fully sedated and ready for relocation.
Pepsi-saurus or Tostito-don.
Security said the invisible fences were a no-fail.
That is the second time this month.
The Pachys short out their implants when they butt heads.
How much longer until they get it out of there?
He just got five milligrams of carfentanil.
Yes, he's very stoned.
So why don't we show a little sympathy?
I mean you do understand these are actual animals, right?
Clean up your workspace. It's chaotic.
I like to think of it as a living system.
Just enough stability... to keep it from collapsing into anarchy.

Mr. Masrani.
You are flying.
I got my license.
- Two more.
- Well, two more days.
- Okay. - So...
- how's my park doing?
- Great.
We're up two and a half percent over last year.
A bit lower than our initial prediction.
No, no, no, how's it doing?
Are the guests having fun?
Are the animals enjoying life?
Well, guest satisfaction is steady in the low 90s.
We don't have a way to measure the animals' emotional experience.
Sure you do.
You can see in their eyes.
Right?
Of course.
Okay.
Now show me my new dinosaur.
Got it. Got it.
Got it.
Oh, my!
You look tense, Claire.
Maybe you should just focus on the controls.
The key to a happy life is to accept you are never actually in control.
Bird!
You should spend a day at the beach. Get some sun.
Right, so...
Marketing thought we could offset some of the costs by...
Enough about cost.
John Hammond entrusted me with his dying wish... and not once did he mention profits.
"Spare no expense," he used to say.
I appreciate that, but the reality of operating a theme park requires...
Don't forget why we built this place, Claire.
Jurassic World exists to remind us how very small we are.
How new. You can't put a price on that.
Now, please, we're flying.
Breathe.
Is he okay?
- Are you okay?
- He's just being dramatic.
Are you still building?
We planned to open in May... but Asset Containment insisted we build the walls up higher.
It's bigger than expected.
It's a good sign.
We hit a few speed bumps early on.
It began to anticipate where the food would come from.
One of the handlers nearly lost an arm.
The others threatened to quit if I couldn't guarantee their safety.
She's intelligent then?
For a dinosaur.
And that?
It tried to break the glass.
I like her spirit.
It's white.
You never told me it was white.
Think it will scare the kids?
The kids?
This will give the parents nightmares.
Is that good?
It's fantastic.
Can she see us?
They say it can sense thermal radiation.
Like snakes.
I thought there were two of them.
There was a sibling in case this one didn't survive infancy.
Where's the sibling?
She ate it.
So, the paddock is quite safe, then?
We have the best structural engineers in the world.
Yeah, so did Hammond.
There's an American Navy man here.
Part of a research program one of my companies is running.
Owen Grady.
I know who he is.
His animals often try to escape.
They are smart.
He has to be smarter.
He only thinks he's smarter.
I want you to bring him in.
Let him inspect the paddock.
Maybe he sees something we can't.
Hold!
Hey!
Okay!
Eyes on me.
Blue?
Blue!
Watch it.
Charlie.
Hey!
Don't give me that shit! Delta!
Lock it up!
Good!
And we're moving!
Hold!
That's good.
That is damn good.
Very good!
See, Charlie, that's what you get!
Echo, there you go!
Delta!
Blue?
This one's for you.
Hold!
Eyes up!
Go.
You finally did it, man.
Owen.
I was starting to think I hired the wrong guys... but, damn, you got them eating out of your palm.
You came on a good day.
It's not usually a happy ending.
Is that why you're not sending in your reports?
We've been busy.
Not too busy to cash your paychecks.
What do you need, buddy?
A field test.
I've just seen they can respond to commands.
We need to take the research and get it on its feet.
These are wild animals, Hoskins.
Trust me, you don't want them in the field.
I just saw a bond.
A real bond.
Between man and beast. - You're in my way.
- Come on.
We're the same.
We're dogs of war.
We know that the military needs to reduce casualties.
Some people think that robots are the future.
Look, nature gave us the most effective killing machines 75 million years ago.
And now we know they can take orders.
We finally make progress and that's the first thing he says?
Make a weapon?
Shit.
Come on, gents.
It's grown-up time.
Drones can't search tunnels and caves.
And they're hackable.
The minute a real war breaks out, all that fancy tech is gonna go dark.
But that tech's not gonna eat them if they forget to feed it.
Look at these creatures.
They've got millions of years of instinct in their cells, instinct that we can program.
Their loyalty cannot be bought.
These guys are gonna run straight into the enemy's teeth and eat them... belt buckle and all.
What if they decide they wanna be in control?
Then we remind them who is.
We terminate the rogues.
Promote only loyal bloodlines.
What's so funny?
You come here and you don't learn anything about these animal, except what you want to know.
You made them and now you think you own them.
We do own them.
Extinct animals have no rights.
They're not extinct anymore, Hoskins.
Exactly.
We're sitting on a goldmine.
And Masrani is using it to stock a petting zoo.
He just wants to teach people some humility.
He doesn't make weapons.
You think that the 8th richest man in the world... is only into oil, telecom and family fun parks?
He's so diversified, he doesn't even know what he owns.
How long has INGEN been practicing this pitch?
Since the day we hired you out of the Navy.
You knew the end game.
These animals can replace thousands of boots on the ground.
How many lives would that save?
War is part of nature.
Look around, Owen.
Every living thing in this jungle... is trying to murder the other.
Mother Nature's way of testing her creations.
Refining the pecking order.
War is a struggle.
Struggle breeds greatness.
Without that... we end up with places like this, charge seven bucks a soda.
Do you hear yourself when you talk?
This is gonna happen. With or without you boys.
Progress always wins, man.
Maybe progress should lose for once.
Pig loose!
Pig loose!
Owen, no!
No, hold your fire!
Hold your fire.
Do not fire.
Put 12 amps in these animals, they're never gonna trust me again.
Blue, stand down.
Stand down.
Hey! Hey!
What did I just say?
Delta, I see you.
Back up!
Okay.
Good.
Good.
Charlie?
Stay right there.
Good.
Close the gate.
Are you crazy?
Just trust me.
Close the gate!
Yeah.
You're the new guy, right?
Yeah.
You ever wonder why there was a job opening?
Don't ever turn your back to the cage.
Lift me up.
I can't see! I'm not Dad.
And you're not five.
I can still ride the Triceratops. I'm 47-and-a-half inches.
This place is for little kids.
Yeah, I know.
- Wanna go on the spinning dinosaur eggs? - Nope.
Cover up your dork pouch.
It's my wedding.
No, Alec's not having a bachelor party.
Because all his friends are animals.
Scatter.
- What?
- Go.
Run. Go!
The next T. Rex feeding will begin in 10 minutes.
- T. Rex!
Come on, man!
- Okay.
Let's go!
Parents be aware, this show may be disturbing for smaller children.
Hey, Mom.
You were supposed to call me when you landed.
Are you having fun?
Yeah, I guess.
Aunt Claire gave us passes so we don't have to wait in line.
Wait, she's not with you?
Hey, Karen!
Hi, Claire. How's it going?
Yeah, everything's great.
The boys are having fun.
Everyone's...
Yeah, everyone's good. Really?
Because I just hung up with Zach and he said that you weren't even with them.
Today turned out to be a really bad day for me.
They're in great hands.
They're with my assistant.
She's British, so, like, they invented nannies.
Wait, are you crying?
This was supposed to be a family weekend, Claire.
You haven't seen the boys in forever.
And I know how Zach will treat Gray if they're by themselves.
And he can just be so mean.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Tomorrow, I'm gonna spend the entire day with them.
I'm going to take off work and I will not leave their side.
I promise.
Well, a promise tomorrow is worth a lot less than trying today.
You're using Mom's lines now?
Oh, my God.
I am using Mom's lines.
I'm sorry, but you know I have to tell you they work.
You'll see when you have kids.
Yeah, "if."
"When." It's worth it.
Bye, Mom.
Bye.
What do they want now?
Mr. Grady?
I need you to come take a look at something.
Why are you calling me Mr. Grady?
Owen.
- If you're not too busy.
- I'm pretty busy.
We have an attraction.
That's not what you said the last time I saw you.
I'm talking about the dinosaurs, Mr. Grady.
Owen.
A new species we've... made.
You just went and made a new dinosaur?
Yeah, it's kind of what we do here.
The exhibit opens to the public in three weeks.
Mr. Masrani wanted me to consult with you.
You wanna consult here or...
in my bungalow?
That's not funny.
A little funny.
We'd like you to evaluate the paddock for vulnerabilities.
Why me?
I guess Mr. Masrani thinks, since you're able to control the Raptors...
It's all about control with you.
I don't control the Raptors. It's a relationship.
It's based on mutual respect.
That's why you and I never had a second date.
Excuse me?
I never wanted a second date.
Who prints out an itinerary for a night out?
I'm an organized person.
What kind of a diet doesn't allow tequila?
All of them, actually.
And what kind of a man shows up to a date in board shorts?
It's Central America. It's hot.
Okay, okay.
Can we just focus on the asset, please?
The asset?
Look, I get it. You're in charge out here.
You gotta make a lot of tough decisions.
It's probably easier to pretend these animals are just numbers on a spreadsheet.
But they're not.
They're alive.
I'm fully aware they're alive.
You might have made them in a test tube, but they don't know that.
They're thinking, "I gotta eat."
"I gotta hunt.
I gotta..."
You can relate to at least one of those things.
Right?
I'll be in the car.
You might want to change your shirt.
They're very sensitive to smell.
The Mosasaurus was thought to have hunted near the surface of the water... where it preyed on anything it could sink its teeth into.
Including turtles, large fish, even smaller Mosasaurus.
Okay, folks, let's see if she's still hungry after already eating today.
She's a little shy, so be nice and give her a hand when she comes out.
Zach!
The Mosasaurus!
Oh, my God!
That was awesome!
Hold on tight.
We're gonna give you an even closer look at our Mosasaurus.
It had 88 teeth!
- Wanna see something else cool?
- Yeah!
We've been pre-booking tickets for months.
The park needs a new attraction every few years... in order to reinvigorate the public's interest.
Kind of like the space program.
Corporate felt genetic modification would up the wow factor.
They're dinosaurs.
Wow enough.
Not according to our focus groups.
The Indominus Rex makes us relevant again.
The Indominus Rex?
We needed something scary and easy to pronounce.
You should hear a four-year-old try to say "Archaeornithomimus."
You should hear you try to say it.
So what's this thing made of?
The base genome is a T. Rex.
The rest is classified.
You made a new dinosaur but you don't even know what it is?
The lab delivers us finished assets, and we show them to the public.
Can we drop a steer, please?
How long has the animal been in here?
All its life.
Never seen anything outside of these walls?
We can't exactly walk it.
And you feed it with that?
Is there a problem?
Animals raised in isolation aren't always the most functional.
Your Raptors are born in captivity.
With siblings.
They learn social skills.
And I imprint on them when they're born.
There's trust.
The only positive relationship this animal has is with that crane.
At least she knows that means food.
So, she needs a friend.
We should schedule play-dates? That sort of thing?
Probably not a good idea.
- Where is it?
- Is it in the basement?
Is there a downstairs?
Maybe it's in the rec room.
It was just here.
We were just here.
Oh, shit.
That doesn't make any sense.
These doors haven't been opened in weeks.
Were those claw marks always there?
Do you think it...?
Oh, God.
She has an implant in her back.
I can track it from the control room.
We have an asset out of containment.
Put ACU on alert.
This is not a drill.
Even though I didn't meet him until I was 13...
I definitely consider Carl to be more of a dad than my real dad.
- Yeah, hello?
- Lowery.
Get me coordinates on the Indominus.
Okay, yeah.
I'm doing it right now.
That wall is 40 feet high.
Do you really think she could have climbed out?
It depends.
On what?
What kind of dinosaur they cooked up in that lab.
Wait, what the hell?
It's in the cage.
No, that's impossible.
I was just there.
Claire, I'm telling you, she's in the cage.
Wait a sec.
There are people in there.
Get them out of there now.
Now!
Paddock 11, this is Control.
You need to evacuate the containment area.
Paddock 11.
Paddock 11, do you copy?
Yeah, what's the problem?
It's in the cage!
It's in there with you!
Go!
Close the door.
We can't lock him in there with that thing.
Close it now!
Somebody talk to me!
What is happening?
Shit!
Everyone remain calm.
The implant will shock it if it gets too close to a perimeter fence.
Okay.
It's moving really fast.
This is Control.
Put out a park-wide alert.
Hang up that damn phone, please.
Sorry, I'm getting new information.
Everything's fine.
Let Asset Containment capture it quietly.
The very existence of this park is predicated on our ability... to handle incidents like this.
It was an eventuality, okay?
You should put that in the brochure.
"Eventually, one of these things will eat somebody."
That paddock is 4 miles from the closest attraction.
ACU can handle this. No one else is gonna get...
Eaten?
How fast can they run?
40.
50 when they're hungry.
You ever open them up, see what they can do?
No.
Oh, shit!
That got me.
It got me.
What do you think?
Want to take one home?
Hey, don't joke.
When I was your age...
I rescued a wolf pup.
It was, like, two months old.
It could barely walk.
It used to sleep by my bed.
Watch over me.
My wife, she came at me with a steak knife.
It took a chunk out of her arm.
Did you put him down?
Hell, no.
We had an unshakeable bond, you know?
Just like you and...
What's his name?
Delta.
And she's a girl.
Can I...?
Oh, wow.
Code 19!
- That's the new one!
- They said we lost two guys!
- What's a Code 19?
- That's Indominus!
Asset out of containment.
These people, they never learn.
They're gonna learn all kinds of things about their new asset now.
Yeah, it's me.
We might have an opportunity here.
You guys been here before?
If Mom and Dad get divorced, will one of us be with Mom and the other with Dad?
What?
Why would you say that?
Because they are.
No, they're not getting...
They're not getting divorced.
Look, you haven't been around long enough.
They've always been that way.
They get mail from two different lawyers.
That doesn't mean anything.
I googled.
They're divorce lawyers.
All right, whatever.
You know what?
It doesn't matter. Okay?
I'm gonna be gone in two years anyway.
All my friends' parents are divorced.
Hey, knock it off.
You're gonna cry?
Look, you're gonna get two of everything. Right?
Two birthdays, two Thanksgivings. Two...
I don't want two of everything.
Yeah, well, it's not up to you.
There's a point you have to grow up.
I need to see a badge.
- Sir, sir. I need to see a badge.
- What the hell happened out there?
Sir! There are thermal cameras all over that paddock.
She did not just disappear!
It must have been some kind of a technical malfunction.
Were you not watching?
She marked up that wall as a distraction.
She wanted us to think she escaped! Hold on.
We are talking about an animal here.
- A highly intelligent animal.
- 400 meters to the beacon.
You're going after her with non-lethals.
We have $26 million invested in that asset.
We can't just kill it.
Those men are gonna die.
300 meters to the beacon.
- Call this mission off right now.
- They're right on top of it.
- Call it off right now.
- You are not in control here!
Blood's not clotted yet.
It's close.
What is that?
That's her tracking implant.
She clawed it out.
How would it know to do that?
She remembered where they put it in.
It can camouflage!
Evacuate the island.
We'd never reopen.
You made a genetic hybrid, raised it in captivity.
She is seeing all of this for the first time.
She does not even know what she is.
She will kill everything that moves.
Do you think the animal is contemplating its own existence?
She is learning where she fits in the food chain... and I'm not sure you want her to figure that out.
Now, Asset Containment can use live ammunition in an emergency situation.
You have an M134 in your armory.
Put it on a chopper and smoke this thing!
We have families here.
I'm not gonna turn this place into some kind of a war zone.
You already have.
Mr. Grady, if you're not gonna help, there's no reason for you to be in here.
I would have a word with your people in the lab.
That thing out there... that's no dinosaur.
I'm going to close everything north of the resort.
This is a Phase One, real world. Bring everyone in.
This is a Phase One, real world.
I repeat, this is a Phase One.
Bring everyone back in.
The soft tissue is preserved because the iron in the dinosaur's blood... generates free radicals, and those are highly reactive.
The proteins and the cell membranes get all mixed up... and act as a natural preservative.
DNA can survive for millennia that way.
Even if the amber mines dry up, they'll still have bones...
Shut up.
What do you think's gonna happen from you just staring at them?
- Thanks, man.
- You're welcome.
Enjoy the ride.
Pregnant women and those who suffer from motion sickness... should consult with a doctor before riding this ride.
Enjoy the ride.
Hello?
Seriously?
Sorry, folks.
The ride is closed.
Everyone needs to proceed to the monorail and exit towards the...
Come on, guys, I just work here.
Due to technical difficulties, all our exhibits are now closed.
You know that I'm not at liberty to reveal the asset's genetic makeup.
Modified animals are known to be unpredictable.
It's killed people, Henry.
That's unfortunate.
What purpose could we have for a dinosaur that can camouflage?
Cuttlefish genes were added to help her withstand an accelerated growth rate.
Cuttlefish have chromatophores that allow the skin to change color.
It hid from thermal technology.
Really?
How is that possible?
Tree frogs can modulate their infrared output.
We used strands from their DNA to adapt her to a tropical climate.
But I never imagined...
Who authorized you to do this?
You did.
"Bigger."
"Scarier."
"Cooler" I believe is the word that you used in your memo.
You cannot have an animal with exaggerated predator features... without the corresponding behavioral traits.
What you're doing here...
What you have done...
The Board will shut down this park, seize your work, everything you've built.
And Hammond won't be there to protect you this time.
All of this exists because of me.
If I don't innovate, somebody else will.
You are to cease all activities here immediately.
You are acting like we are engaged in some kind of mad science.
But we are doing what we have done from the beginning.
Nothing in Jurassic World is natural.
We have always filled gaps in the genome with the DNA of other animals.
And, if their genetic code was pure, many of them would look quite different.
But you didn't ask for reality.
You asked for more teeth.
- I never asked for a monster!
- "Monster" is a relative term.
To a canary, a cat is a monster.
We're just used to being the cat.
Hey, there.
I'm Jimmy Fallon.
Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere, an amazing machine made possible by science.
Your safety is our main concern.
Which is why you're behind our invisible barrier system... which protects you from things like Dilophosaurus venom.
One drop of this can paralyze you, so watch out.
Is this real?
It is?
And for added protection, each vehicle is surrounded by aluminum oxynitride glass.
So tough, it can stop a .50-caliber bullet.
The Gyroscopic technology will keep you upright at all times...
Where are they?
So you've got nothing to worry about.
Oh, man.
Due to technical difficulties all our exhibits are now closed.
Please disembark all rides and return to the resort.
Come on, we can stay out a couple more minutes.
But they said it was closed.
Aunt Claire gave us special wristbands, right?
We're VIP, dude.
Come on.
It'll be fun.
- Hello? - Zara.
I need you to bring the boys back to the hotel right away.
I don't know...
I've been looking everywhere for them.
Slow down.
I can't hear you.
Zach and Gray, they've run off.
They what?
Hey, Claire.
Zach, thank God.
Is Gray with you?
I can't really hear you.
We're in the hamster ball.
Okay.
Zach, listen to me.
I need you to...
Hello?
- Zach?
Are there any Gyrospheres left in the Valley?
No, they're all accounted for.
It's my job. What?
There's one in the field.
Send a team of rangers, bring them in.
Security, we need a search and rescue in the Valley.
It's gonna be a while.
We've got our hands full out here. No, no, no.
There are two guests missing!
You need to make this your top priority!
- Just do it, man. - There's a lot of guests missing.
We're doing the best we can. Okay. Fine.
I'll do it myself.
Hey, do you think I'm the one you need to be worried about right now?
Back off!
What happened here?
Dude.
Off-road.
But they told us to go back.
I'm just worried you're not getting the full Jurassic World experience.
Claire!
- I need you.
- Okay.
I need your help.
My nephews, they're out in the Valley.
Please, if anything happens to them...
How old?
The older one, he's high school age. The younger one, he's...
- He's a few years...
- You don't know how old your nephews are?
No, no.
Bad idea, bad idea.
- Great idea. - No!
We're gonna get arrested.
They'll shave our heads, and we're gonna have to make root beer in the toilet.
What are you talking about?
There.
I told you.
Up close and personal... with four dinosauruses.
Ankylosaurus.
We shouldn't be here.
And there's five dinosaurs.
Aren't you supposed to be a genius or something?
One, two, three... four.
Five.
- Go, go, go!
Hold it together, man!
Drive!
Drive!
We're safe in here, right?
Yeah. They're totally safe.
Come on.
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.
Zach.
I almost got it.
- Zach?
- Yeah?
Look.
What?
Go!
Go!
- We're gonna have to jump.
- I can't. Are you ready?
One, two...
You jumped.
Stay in the car.
Hi.
Hi.
I know, I know.
It's all right.
All right, girl.
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
You're okay.
It didn't eat them.
It's killing for sport.
Units on standby, ready for go.
Good.
Hold off on that live feed.
We've got an evolving situation here.
Did they give you the green light yet?
They will.
Owen, we have a situation here.
Hey, there.
I'm Jimmy Fallon.
Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere, an amazing machine made possible by science.
Hey, there. Your safety is our main concern.
Now just relax and enjoy the ride.
No, no, no. No.
Hey.
They made it out.
Oh, my God, they jumped.
Brave kids.
Zach!
Gray!
Hey, I am not one of your damn animals.
Listen, those kids are still alive... but you and I will not be if you continue to scream like that.
So, you can pick up their scent, can't you?
Track their footprints?
I was with the Navy, not the Navajo.
So then what should we do?
What do you suggest we do?
You get back.
I'll find them.
No, we'll find them.
You'll last two minutes in there.
Less, in those ridiculous shoes.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means I'm ready to go.
Okay.
Let's get one thing straight.
I'm in charge out here.
You do everything I say, exactly as I say it.
- Excuse me?
- Just relax.
It's just like taking a stroll through the woods.
65 million years ago.
Stay here.
Wow.
You still have those matches?
Here you go.
Gray!
1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, Sand Beige.
You remember when we fixed up Grandpa's old Malibu, right?
Yeah.
Every time this thing kills, it moves further south.
It's headed right for the park.
Why would she come here?
She can sense thermal radiation.
Our emergency measures just put all the warm bodies in one place.
- Sir...
- INGEN.
Hoskins.
I know who you are.
Then you know why I'm here.
I've been working for two years on an application for those Raptors.
They can hunt and kill that creature.
But your program was to test their intelligence.
Yeah, it was.
And we did.
And in the process, we learned something.
They follow orders.
You see, the solution to your crisis is standing right in front of you.
Let me be as clear as I can.
No Velociraptors are going to be set loose on this island.
Oh, shit.
You're out of your mind!
What are you going to do with all these people?
You got 20,000 people here.
What are you going to do?
They have no place to go.
That thing is a killing machine!
And it will not stop.
Okay.
I intend to personally look into your project... to determine its viability within the moral principles of this company.
Okay, boss.
What's your next move?
Sir, I can't get a hold of your instructor.
Never mind.
He's likely caught up in the evacuation.
You're sure there's nobody else who can fly a helicopter?
We don't need anyone else.
You think it's out there?
I mean, I know for a fact it is definitely not out there, all right?
We're totally safe.
Here, go take this.
You're stronger than me.
All right. Turn it over.
It works!
I thought you failed your driver's test.
No, only the driving part.
This one of theirs?
Yeah.
That road goes straight back to the park.
How did they even get one of these things started?
Lowery, we found her.
South of the Gyrosphere Valley, between the old park and the Aviary.
- Wait, are you following the dinosaur?
- Yes. Get ACU out here.
Real guns this time.
ACU is airborne.
They took the helicopter.
Who's flying it?
Did you boys serve in the Armed Forces?
Afghanistan, sir.
Did your general ever fly into battle with you?
Got it!
Got it.
We have eyes on the target, south of the Aviary.
Proceed and engage.
Come on!
Look alive, boys!
Look alive!
10 o'clock!
By the birdcage!
No, no, no! No, no, no.
Looks like the fox got in the henhouse.
Pull up!
Pull up!
We have a breach in the Aviary.
Trees, the trees!
Go!
Go!
Okay, that's it.
We're safe now.
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!
Hurry up!
Hey!
- Help!
- Open the gate!
Let us in! - Open it up!
- Come on!
That's a first.
Open the gate!
- Open the gate!
- Let us in!
Attention Aviary employees, there has been a containment breach.
Hello?
Claire, we spotted the boys on surveillance.
They're approaching the west gate.
I'm headed there now.
Okay, okay. Stay right there.
I'm on my way.
Stay right with them.
Hey!
Get on!
Ladies and gentlemen, due to a containment anomaly... all guests must take shelter immediately.
Ladies and gentlemen, due to a containment anomaly... all guests must take shelter immediately.
Ladies and gentlemen, due to a containment anomaly... all guests must take shelter immediately.
All units, take position on boardwalk.
Use liquid tranquilizers.
Do not fire live ammunition.
Claire, come on!
Stop running!
Don't just stand there!
Go!
Get inside now!
Zach!
Gray!
- Aunt Claire!
- Go, go!
Claire!
No!
Hold your...
Is that Aunt Claire?
It's them!
Gray!
Oh, my God!
Thank God!
What happened?
What is this?
Are you okay?
Where did you go?
Why didn't you come back?
- I was so worried about you.
- Who's that?
We work together.
Hey.
- We gotta go. - Okay.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Hey, hey!
You guys can't just be walking up in...
Simon Masrani's death was a tragedy.
The new mission is to prevent further loss of life.
Who are these guys?
I'm glad you asked.
You're all relieved of duty.
There's a new team on the ground.
Lowery, I'm on my way back to you.
That's a bad idea.
The board assigned emergency ops to INGEN's private security division.
This guy Hoskins is in charge.
And he has this insane plan to use the Raptors to hunt the Indominus.
What do you mean "use the Raptors"?
Son of a bitch!
You shouldn't say "bitch."
Take the kids. Get them someplace safe.
- You got this!
Damn it, drive!
- Go faster!
This does not feel safe.
Can we stay with you?
I am never leaving you as long as you live.
No, no, no.
Yeah, definitely him.
Right here.
Right here.
She looks at what she wants.
Usually what she wants to eat.
The mother hen has finally arrived.
Get the hell out of here and stay away from my animals.
Hoskins, you wanted this to happen, you son of a bitch!
Oh, Jesus!
How many more people have to die before this mission starts to make sense to you?
It's not a mission.
It's a field test.
This is an INGEN situation now.
Okay, there are gonna be cruise ships that show up here at first light.
Everybody's gonna get off this island.
You're gonna watch a news story tomorrow about how you all saved lives.
No, no, no, better yet... how your animals saved lives.
They've never been out of containment.
It's crazy.
Let's move it out!
This is happening!
With or without you.
We know that she is in sector five.
This is a game we call hide-and-seek.
It's a scent drill.
We've done it about a thousand times with these animals.
When they get on target, and they will get on target... wait to engage.
Velociraptors are pack hunters.
They like to herd the animal into a kill zone.
That's when we take our shot.
Get a clear shot, wait on my command and give her everything you got.
We got one good target, gentlemen.
Do not shoot my Raptors.
Please.
Easy, Blue.
Easy.
Attagirl.
You don't scare me.
Owen.
Are they safe?
No, they're not.
What are their names?
Well, you got Charlie.
There's Echo.
Here is Delta.
This one's called Blue.
She's the beta.
Who's the alpha?
You're looking at him, kid.
See?
Totally safe.
All right, get in.
Come on.
Get in there.
If you need me, I'll be right up front.
Just open that window.
Okay?
Put your seatbelts on.
Okay, so just... hold hands.
Nothing's getting in here, right?
Hey.
Do you remember that ghost at the old house?
Remember the one in the garage?
I protected you, right?
You made a battle axe out of a ruler and a paper plate.
Yeah.
See, nothing is gonna get you while I'm around, okay?
But you're not always gonna be around.
Yeah, well...
Hey.
We're brothers, okay?
We'll always be brothers and we'll always come back to one another.
No matter what.
No matter what?
No matter what.
Awesome.
Here we go.
Your boyfriend's a badass.
Imagine if we had these puppies in Tora Bora.
Are you recording this thing?
They're slowing down.
They got something.
You know what?
No, no, no.
You guys are not gonna watch this.
Keep the window closed.
Something's wrong.
They're communicating.
I know why they wouldn't tell us what it's made of.
Why?
That thing's part Raptor.
What's taking them so long?
Light it up! Engage!
Oh, my God.
Watch your six.
Raptors got a new alpha.
To the vehicles now!
Fall back!
No!
Blue!
Oh, my God.
Is everybody dead?
No, no, no.
Everyone is fine.
Don't lie to him.
He's scared.
It's okay to lie when people are scared.
I wanna go home.
Sweetheart, you will, okay?
I promise.
Tomorrow you will be home... and your mother will never let me see you again.
Get out of here!
They're coming!
Just hold on back there.
- Turn it on.
- I don't know how.
Are you boys okay?
Hey, did you see that?
I can't wait to tell Mom.
Please, no. Do not tell your mother about that, ever.
- Owen!
- Owen!
We gotta get indoors.
Follow me.
Lowery, we're headed your way.
Call in a chopper.
Everything must be accounted for.
I want all backup generators online.
Where have you been?
Change of plans.
Mission took a jog to the left.
I'm taking everything off-site.
The embryos are safe here.
They can live up to eight weeks on the generators.
No, no.
You listen. The park's gonna be Chapter 11 by morning.
Okay, our little side project's about to get a shot in the arm.
I don't want a bunch of lawyers messing around with something that they don't understand.
You get it?
Hey!
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to thank you for your patience.
The next ferry will be leaving in 45 minutes.
If you require immediate medical attention, please report to the nearest health service station.
Is this what you had in mind?
Okay, people. We have an extraction point at the east dock.
Hey.
They said we had to evacuate.
There's a boat.
You coming?
Someone has to stay behind.
No.
I have a boyfriend.
I didn't know that you guys were, like, together-together.
We are.
That's good. You don't mention him, ever.
No, I'm at work.
No, no, no.
Yeah.
- Well...
- Yeah, okay.
- Great.
- Great.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah.
Okay, bye.
Where's Hoskins?
He's sending you and the assets to a secure location.
But our deal is still intact?
Don't worry.
You'll be well taken care of.
Let's go!
Thank you for visiting Jurassic World.
We hope you enjoyed your adventure.
Don't forget to visit the gift shop, and remember...
It's always happy hour at Margaritaville.
Come on, come on.
Go inside.
Control room.
That way.
They evacuated the lab.
What are you doing?
I'm afraid that's above your pay grade, honey.
Where's Henry?
Dr. Wu works for us.
That's not a real dinosaur.
No, it ain't, kid.
But somebody's gotta make sure that this company has a future.
Imagine... that one, a fraction of the size... deadly... intelligent... able to hide from the most advanced military technology.
A living weapon unlike anything we've ever seen.
You see?
Millions of years of evolution... what did we learn?
Nature is the gift that just...
Oh, shit!
Easy.
Easy, boy.
Easy.
Hey, hey.
We're on the same side, right?
Right?
Easy. Easy.
I'm on your side.
No, boys. This way.
Come on. Come on.
That's how it is, huh?
Easy.
Easy.
That's it.
24, 50.
We need more.
More what?
Teeth.
We need more teeth.
Okay, so, you just wait here.
It's gonna be fine.
Lowery, are you still there?
Hey, where are you?
I need you to open Paddock 9.
Paddock 9?
You kidding?
Damn it, Lowery, be a man and do something for once in your life.
Why did you have to make it personal?
Run!
Go!
Go, go!
Oh, my God, it's your parents. It's your parents.
Come on, come on.
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
Come here.

So, what do we do now?
Probably stick together.
For survival.
Your boy is very impatient!

Why are you laughing?
If its a girl?
Girl!
What is your name dear?
Shahida.
Shahida.

It's getting dark..
You go home.. I'll get your sheep home.
Rauf!
Rauf!
Where is Shahida?
Isn't she home yet?
She hasn't.
Stay here.
I have been telling you for days to take her to Delhi.
Even mute people can get cured there.
I was speechless at 5 years old.
I was taken there.
Did you get cured?
Do you wanna hear me talk?
But it's in India.
So what..
Its not in the US.
It is easier to go to the US..
Yes we were one nation long time ago..

I'll do anything for her.
I've decided.
I'll take Shahida to Delhi
no one returned empty handed from the God's beloved .
She will talk again, by the time you reach Pakistan.
Why has the train stopped?
-Slight delay due to construction madam.
It will be fixed soon. Don't you worry.
I'll go to sleep then..
Shahida.
What happened?
-I can't find my daughter!
Indians are saying they couldn't find your daughter
They'll search in the morning.
Sir..
Please listen to me.
Let me go and find her myself.
But its across the border, ..in a foreign land
So what.
I've to bring back my daughter.
But to go there you'll need a visa.
Be patient, you'll get your daughter. -How is that possible?
Don't you understand..
My daughter is mute..
She is alone in a foreign land.
You people are hopeless..
I'll find Shahida by myself.
Trust in the Lord.
Stop crying my child..
Hope she'll be found by a good person.
..Someone who will take good care of her.

One paratha for this little girl please..
-OK sir.

Seems that she's deaf.
She heard my order for paratha.
You are right..
Let me try.

-Try writing in French. She's 5 years old
Eat well.
Why are you following me?
Take this.

For him health was as important as education.
Good..
lets start.
I even failed in wrestling.
No laughing..

Nothing can be done..
wrestling tickles me..
Wrestling always tickled me.. I was helpless.
The honor he had was not enough for him he also became a leader..
Studies, wrestling, leadership...
I wasn't interested in any of it
He gave me a special nickname..
What?
Zero.
What?
-I failed.
I took 20 years to complete schooling.
..from school to graduation, I failed 10 times.
My father had given up on me.
What?
-I failed.
My friends advised me to cheat in exams.
But I am Bajarangbali's disciple..
I said I will fail but never cheat.
So I approached him the 11th time.
Please come.
You must have broken your own record in failing.
when you completed your schooling...
Why did you have to honor me anymore by failing 11 times.
I've accepted that you're foolish.
you're zero..
-But listen to me..
What should I listen?
Tell me..
you've failed 10 times.
..and failed me 20 times..
But listen to me..
What is left there to listen, you tell me...
If you want to do something for me..
Go away from here..

I heard that there is scarcity of fools.
I've an old friend there "Dayanand"
He'll get you a job..
I passed the exams.
What did your father tell you?
He might have got shocked.
I knew he'll be in shock, but didn't know its intensity.
What happened?

Let's go.
Who wants to stay here!
Sir..
You can't be engaged with Rasika.

To be capable, my first condition is house.

That's for one person.
Why should she pay?

Amazing bro..

Without a doubt.
What is the little girl's role in this mission?
She's the reason.
That's enough..
..now leave..
Come in the front.
Hurry up.
As you've seen in our exclusive footage..
..an Indian spy and his partner in crime, a 6 year old girl.
They've just been arrested at Chawla.
The girl's training..

Once more..
No, it was OK.
Turn it off.
Indian SIM card.

No sir, we haven't seen them.
Sir that Chand Nawab told me that its this bus.
Sir..
.she was doing this gesture..
showing that her home..
was in one of those pictures.
Where's that photo?
Its with them.
Check all the buses on highway.
Quick!
Either you are very brave..
..or a big fool.
You entered Pakistan just like that.. no fear?
I was left with no choice.
Ok.. but how will you find her parents?
Bajarangbali will help..
In Pakistan?
Tonight you'll be safer here.
..but..
..leave early in the morning.
What is this place?
Mosque.
Forgive me Bajarangbali.

Why were you absent?
Sorry sir..
Go..
I'll be there soon.
I can't go inside.
Why?
I'm not Mohammedan.
So what brother...
This place is open for everyone.
..this is why we never lock our mosque..
Come on..
So that's your problem.
I've never been to these places..
..but yes..
..we have some students who..
.may be from there.
Let me ask them.
Dear students..
Yes sir..
Have a good look at this picture.
..and tell me where it is.

..a big one.
Stop!
Stop!
Take it back..

He was with Chand Nawab.

If you don't know then let others answer.
I'm telling you the truth.
This is Switzerland.
Here its written in English.
Switzerland.
Munni?
!
Are you from Switzerland.?
Stop!
You can find such locations in Kashmir.
Kashmir?
Go back to India?
No Sir..
..we also have a small part.
What?
Kashmir.
Stop there sir.
Please put your guns away.
Have you seen any strangers Maulana Sahab?
There are no strangers in God's house.
This stranger is dangerous...
An Indian spy.
Did you think that he'll come here..
..to steal some atom bomb formula?
Kindly inform us if you see any strangers around.
-OK.
Its difficult to escape.
Is there a way?
There's a way.
What else will you make me do Bajarangbali?
slept in Mosque, wore burqa..
and before my circumcision..
..I beg you to find her parents.
What!
He's in Pakistan!
You said..
..he'll leave her at Atari..
How can he go to Pakistan?
Who gave him passport, visa?
He went without that.
He went there without Passport and Visa?
!
You'll ruin your health... ..calm down.
You have no idea what they will do to him.
One is hard enough..
..but Maulana Sahab has two of them.
There will be police on road... ..you go through those fields..
..you'll reach Khanewal.
Thank you.
You doing a noble task.
I'll pray to Allah that you find her parents.
How is it that you say?
Jai Sri Ram?
Jai Sri Ram.
-Yes Jai Sri Ram.
Jai Sri Ram.
Let's keep moving.
You are responsible for this.
..neither you had to send Munni away..
nor Pawan had to go.
..you are the reason he's in trouble.
Do something.
What can I do?
If you don't do anything..
..i'll also go to Pakistan.
What!
O Lord!
Without any visa.
Can't do this anymore.
I can't breath nor walk.
One of us have to dress like a wife.
Police are looking for two men and a child.
You do it.
Really.
If someone asks your name..
you'll say..
"My name's Pawan Chatravedi.."
"..
I'm from Delhi, I worship Bajarangbali.."
"..
I got permission to crawl under the border fences."
Am I right Munni?
There are people..
..put down your veil.
..walk like a woman.
Munni..
Do me a favor..
She'll get caught!
This is wrong.
Dishonesty is never rewarded.
Mark my words.
You spoke again woman!
Now shut it.
O this vehicle..
Sir, can I give you a hand?
Sure.
Kindly be seated..
Start it when I tell you.
-OK.
Did you find the fault?
It takes time to find the illness.
Are you a mechanic or a doctor?
Try it now.
What did you do?
Try it again.
That's what I did.
Wow you fixed it in a minute.
Its my duty to help travelers.
Thanks a lot.
Shall I drop you someplace?
What's your name dear?
She has been speechless since birth.
Wonder how her mother feels!
What do doctors say madam?
She is also speechless.
..same condition.
..its hereditary.
Its all fate.
True.
Are you going to Khanewal?
No.
But don't you worry..
..I'll leave you home..
You don't really have to do that sir..
Just drop us at highway.
I will ask one of my..
..officers to drive you..
..to your home.
Officers!
what do you mean?
I'm the Superintend of that area.
I was on leave today..
..going back to work because of an emergency.
Emergency?
There's an Indian spy around here..
He won't escape.
Where is Chand Nawab?
I don't know.
You don't!
-Please don't beat anymore
..I swear that I saw him last time..
..entering into bus.
I tried ... calling him.
..phone's switched off.
Now..
..try calling him before me.

Switched off.
Come with me..
..this is my stop.
..my men will leave you home.
Please come.
Hey Hassan.
-Yes sir.

..an amazing mechanic too.
Leave them at their doorstep at Khanewal.
-Yes sir

Thank you sir.
Thank you..
..you did me a big favor.
You may have breakfast here.
No thank you..
..we'll leave.
Let's go.
Please sit.
Careful.
See you.
Call him every hour.
He'll answer sometime.
Where's your house?
A little further.
Are you lost?
I haven't been here for a long time..
..I eloped with her, so her father is angry.
This is it.
Here?
-Yes.
Thank God we found your house.
You almost forgot your home..
It happens sometimes.
That's alright.
Get me Waqar.
Yes sir.
Any info about that spy?
His name is Pawan alias Bajarangi.
He's with a local journalist..
Chand Nawab.
Let me leave you inside.
-Won't be necessary sir.
..thanks a lot for leaving us here.
Bye
-Take care.
Father-in-law..
How are you?
Who are you?
Forgive us..
..there's you daughter and grand child.
Come here dear.
Who is she?
What's she doing?
I don't have any daughter.
What's the use of getting angry here..
..lets go inside.
Getting me involved without any reason.
I know you are angry with me..
But!
-Hit me.
But I...
Sir..
Sir..
Let him go sir..
Sir...sir.
Let's go inside.
Take it easy..
Good bye sir.
-Good bye.
..They also have a little girl.
Girl?
How old?
Around 5 or 6 years old.
5 to 6 years old?
And she can't speak.
Speechless?
Yes sir.
Then why are you still standing there?
!
..Radio the message to Hassan immediately.
Sir.
Who is that?
Open the door.
Are you gonna break my door?
Huh!
You!
Where are they?
Who?
Your daughter and son-in-law.
I've said this many times..
.have no daughter or son-in-law.
Then where are they who claimed to be your daughter and son-in-law?
How will I know?
They vanished as soon as you left.
I was thinking of surrendering to police.
..then the police will ..
..somehow find..
Munni's parents.
Don't even think about it.
You'll rot in jail and nobody will know your whereabouts.
And do you think the police will have your kind of passion?
..They might try for 2 or 3 days ..and then..
..Munni will be sent to orphanage.
I will never allow this..
I've promised Bajarangbali..
..that I'll find her home.
..I am determined.
There might be a way..
Television.
TV?
Story has no punch.
It has sir..
An Indian..
..the way he helps a speechless Pakistani child..
..its an awesome story sir.
Your spy's story... had more punch..
..what happened to that.. ..but he's not a spy.
..then there's nothing left.
Bye.
Hello!
Sir but...
What good is that story to us?
Sir..
..a child will get her parents..
Get her parents!
Bro..
We sell news..alright..
..We are not Hazrat Amin Shah Dargah.
..who unites separated people.
Bye.
Hate is easy to sell.
..but love..
What is Hazrat Amin Shah Dargah.?
Its a famous shrine.
It is said that wishes can come true.
Why didn't we go there yet?
Really..
..you get sick of mosques and shrines..
Remember that mosque..
..you were running away as if seen a ghost..
I can go to any shrine for Munni's sake.
Lets travel tonight.
Its ringing!
Kamil!
I was worried.. thank God..
Where are you?
Is someone near you?
Nobody is around me.
Are you with the spy?
He's not a spy.
He's a noble man.
What do you mean?
He's here to unite the lost girl.
Where are you now?
We are leaving for Hazrat Amin Shah Dargah.
Its said that it unites separated people.
Take care of yourself.
I'll see you later..
Where are you going?
I'm Chand Nawab..
Today I am going to tell you about a man who came here without any visa..
..but entered our land at night by crawling under the border fences.
..His name is Bajarangi.
Just like the police, I too believed.. that he's a spy..
..but now I know..
..that he's no spy..
..then what is he?
Why is he in our land?
What does he want?
He's a common man just like you and me..
And he's here because of love.
Compassion for a 6 year old speechless girl.
..who lost her parents in India.
When all the door were closed... ..he had to take this route to find her parents.
All the TV channels refused to air this story..
..calling is bogus and waste of time.
..and that nobody will be interested.
So I plead you to help Bajarangi ..find her parents..
..and also for his safe journey back home.
Ring him.
He's here with the police...
They are near.
He's not answering.
Answer the phone.
What!
Answer the phone.
-Why?
There's a plan.
Hello brother Chand Nawab!
Is everything alright?
Everything is fine.
Did you go to the shrine?
Yes we went there last night.
Where are you now?
Now?
We are going to Gojra.
You are going to Gojra.
OK..
OK I'll call you later.
Take care.
Wow bro..

Pakistani people has sympathy for him.
Then..
..tell the media..
..the he has confessed ..

Ask your men to get information from India.

Stop it!
Hello.

..Kurukshetra police station and Delhi High Commission.

He is no spy.
Mr. Hamid Khan..
You cannot decide who's what... ..that's my job.
..your job is to make him confess..
..that he's a spy.
But sir..
And yes..
..if you can't follow orders..
..then I can send someone more able..
..and then you'll be on long leave.
He wants his confession at any cost.
I've worked all my life protecting and honoring this country
..but..
..if..
..this man..
..spends all his life behind bars in Pakistan..
..it will be against our country's honor.
I'll not let that happen.
Hello.
Who is this?
Hamid sir!
Yes sir?
